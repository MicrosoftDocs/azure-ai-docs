{"query": "What is machine learning?", "response": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.", "ground_truth": "Machine learning is a type of AI that learns from data to make predictions or decisions."}
{"query": "Explain neural networks.", "response": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes.", "ground_truth": "Neural networks are a set of algorithms modeled after the human brain designed to recognize patterns."}
{"query": "What is natural language processing?", "response": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.", "ground_truth": "NLP is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language."}
{"query": "What is reinforcement learning?", "response": "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions and receiving rewards or penalties.", "ground_truth": "Reinforcement learning is an ML paradigm where agents learn optimal behavior through trial-and-error interactions with an environment."}
{"query": "What are large language models?", "response": "Large language models are deep learning models trained on massive text datasets that can generate, understand, and manipulate human language.", "ground_truth": "Large language models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on large text corpora that can perform various language tasks."}
