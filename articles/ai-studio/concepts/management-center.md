# Management center overview

The management center is a part of the Azure AI Studio that streamlines governance and management activities. From the management center, you can manage Azure AI Studio hubs, projects, resources, and settings. To visit the management center, select the __Management center__ link from the left menu of [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).

## Manage hubs and projects

You can use the management center to create and configure hubs and projects within those hubs. Use __All resources__ to view all hubs and projects that you have access to. Use the __Hub__ and __Project__ sections of the left menu to manage individual hubs and projects.

## Manage resource utilization

You can view and manage quotas and usage metrics across multiple hubs and Azure subscriptions. Use the __Quota__ link from the left menu to view and manage quotas.
