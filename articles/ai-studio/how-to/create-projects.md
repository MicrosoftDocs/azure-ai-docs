# Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal

This article describes how to create an Azure AI Foundry project. A project is used to organize your work and save state while building customized AI apps. 

Projects are hosted by an Azure AI Foundry hub. If your company has an administrative team that has created a hub for you, you can create a project from that hub. If you are working on your own, you can create a project and a default hub will automatically be created for you.

For more information about the projects and hubs model, see [Azure AI Foundry hubs](../concepts/ai-resources.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- For Python SDK or CLI steps, an Azure AI Foundry hub. If you don't have a hub, see [How to create and manage an Azure AI Foundry hub](create-azure-ai-resource.md). 
- For Azure AI Foundry, a hub isn't required. It is created for you when needed.

## Create a project

Use the following tabs to select the method you plan to use to create a project:

# [AI Foundry portal](#tab/ai-studio)

[!INCLUDE [Create Azure AI Foundry project](../includes/create-projects.md)]

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

The code in this section assumes you have an existing hub.  If you don't have a hub, see [How to create and manage an Azure AI Foundry hub](create-azure-ai-resource.md) to create one.

[!INCLUDE [SDK setup](../includes/development-environment-config.md)]

8. Use the following code to create a project from a hub you or your administrator created previously. Replace example string values with your own values:

    ```Python
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import Project
    
    my_project_name = "myexampleproject"
    my_display_name = "My Example Project"
    hub_name = "myhubname" # Azure resource manager ID of the hub
    hub_id=f"/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{hub_name}"
    
    my_project = Project(name=my_project_name, 
                    display_name=my_display_name,
                    hub_id=hub_id)
    
    created_project = ml_client.workspaces.begin_create(workspace=my_project).result()
    ```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

The code in this section assumes you have an existing hub.  If you don't have a hub, see [How to create and manage an Azure AI Foundry hub](create-azure-ai-resource.md) to create one.

1. If you don't have the Azure CLI and machine learning extension installed, follow the steps in the [Install and set up the machine learning extension](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-cli) article.

1. To authenticate to your Azure subscription from the Azure CLI, use the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

    For more information on authenticating, see [Authentication methods](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

1. Once the extension is installed and authenticated to your Azure subscription, use the following command to create a new Azure AI Foundry project from an existing Azure AI Foundry hub:

    ```azurecli
    az ml workspace create --kind project --hub-id {my_hub_ARM_ID} --resource-group {my_resource_group} --name {my_project_name}
    ```

## View project settings

# [AI Foundry portal](#tab/ai-studio)

On the project **Overview** page you can find information about the project.

:::image type="content" source="../media/how-to/projects/project-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an AI Foundry project settings page." lightbox = "../media/how-to/projects/project-settings.png":::

- Name: The name of the project appears in the top left corner. You can rename the project using the edit tool.
- Subscription: The subscription that hosts the hub that hosts the project.
- Resource group: The resource group that hosts the hub that hosts the project.

Select **Management center** to navigate to the project resources in Azure AI Foundry portal.
Select **Manage in Azure portal** to navigate to the project resources in the Azure portal.

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

To manage or use the new project, include it in the `MLClient`:

```python
ml_client = MLClient(workspace_name=my_project_name, resource_group_name=resource_group, subscription_id=subscription_id,credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

To view settings for the project, use the `az ml workspace show` command. For example:

```azurecli
az ml workspace show --name {my_project_name} --resource-group {my_resource_group}
```

## Access project resources

Common configurations on the hub are shared with your project, including connections, compute instances, and network access, so you can start developing right away.

In addition, a number of resources are only accessible by users in your project workspace:

- Components including datasets, flows, indexes, deployed model API endpoints (open and serverless).
- Connections created by you under 'project settings.'
- Azure Storage blob containers, and a fileshare for data upload within your project. Access storage using the following connections:
   
   | Data connection | Storage location | Purpose |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | workspaceblobstore | {project-GUID}-azureml-blobstore | Default container for data uploads |
   | workspaceartifactstore | {project-GUID}-azureml | Stores components and metadata for your project such as model weights |
   | workspacefilestore | {project-GUID}-code | Hosts files created on your compute and using prompt flow |

> [!NOTE]
> Storage connections are not created directly with the project when your storage account has public network access set to disabled. These are created instead when a first user accesses AI Foundry over a private network connection.
