# Use Terraform to create an Azure AI Foundry hub

In this article, you use Terraform to create an Azure AI Foundry hub, a project, and AI services connection. A hub is a central place for data scientists and developers to collaborate on machine learning projects. It provides a shared, collaborative space to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. The hub is integrated with Azure Machine Learning and other Azure services, making it a comprehensive solution for machine learning tasks. The hub also allows you to manage and monitor your AI deployments, ensuring they're performing as expected.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. You can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- [Install and configure Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure)

## Implement the Terraform code

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code for this article is located in the [Azure Terraform GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-ai-studio). You can view the log file containing the [test results from current and previous versions of Terraform](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-ai-studio/TestRecord.md).

1. Create a directory in which to test and run the sample Terraform code and make it the current directory.

1. Create a file named `providers.tf` and insert the following code.

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-ai-studio/providers.tf":::

1. Create a file named `main.tf` and insert the following code.

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-ai-studio/main.tf":::

1. Create a file named `variables.tf` and insert the following code.

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-ai-studio/variables.tf":::

1. Create a file named `outputs.tf` and insert the following code.
    
    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-ai-studio/outputs.tf":::

## Initialize Terraform

[!INCLUDE [terraform-init.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-init.md)]

## Create a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan.md)]

## Apply a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-apply-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-apply-plan.md)]

## Verify the results

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Get the Azure resource group name.

    ```console
    resource_group_name=$(terraform output -raw resource_group_name)
    ```

1. Get the workspace name.

    ```console
    workspace_name=$(terraform output -raw workspace_name)
    ```

1. Run [az ml workspace show](/cli/azure/ml/workspace#az-ml-workspace-show) to display information about the new workspace.

    ```azurecli
    az ml workspace show --resource-group $resource_group_name \
                         --name $workspace_name
    ```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Get the Azure resource group name.

    ```console
    $resource_group_name=$(terraform output -raw resource_group_name)
    ```

1. Get the workspace name.

    ```console
    $workspace_name=$(terraform output -raw workspace_name)
    ```

1. Run [Get-AzMLWorkspace](/powershell/module/az.machinelearningservices/get-azmlworkspace) to display information about the new workspace.

    ```azurepowershell
    Get-AzMLWorkspace -ResourceGroupName $resource_group_name `
                      -Name $workspace_name
    ```
