# Serp API tool for flows in Azure AI Foundry portal

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview.md)]

The prompt flow Serp API tool provides a wrapper to the [Serp API Google Search Engine Results API](https://serpapi.com/search-api) and [Serp API Bing Search Engine Results API](https://serpapi.com/bing-search-api).

You can use the tool to retrieve search results from many different search engines, including Google and Bing. You can specify a range of search parameters, such as the search query, location, and device type.

## Prerequisites

Sign up on the [Serp API home page](https://serpapi.com/).

To create a Serp connection:

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ml.azure.com/).
1. Go to **Project settings** > **Connections**.
1. Select **+ New connection**.
1. Add the following custom keys to the connection:

    - `azureml.flow.connection_type`: `Custom`
    - `azureml.flow.module`: `promptflow.connections`
    - `api_key`: Your Serp API key. You must select the **is secret** checkbox to keep the API key secure.

The connection is the model used to establish connections with the Serp API. Get your API key from the Serp API account dashboard.
