# How to deploy a TimeGEN-1 model with Azure AI Foundry

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview.md)]

In this article, you learn how to use Azure AI Foundry to deploy the TimeGEN-1 model as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing.
You filter on the Nixtla collection to browse the TimeGEN-1 model in the [Model Catalog](model-catalog.md).

The Nixtla TimeGEN-1 is a generative, pretrained forecasting and anomaly detection model for time series data. TimeGEN-1 can produce accurate forecasts for new time series without training, using only historical values and exogenous covariates as inputs.

[!INCLUDE [models-preview](../includes/models-preview.md)]

## Deploy TimeGEN-1 as a serverless API

Certain models in the model catalog can be deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing. This kind of deployment provides a way to consume models as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance that organizations need. This deployment option doesn't require quota from your subscription.

You can deploy TimeGEN-1 as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing. Nixtla offers TimeGEN-1 through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Nixtla can change or update the terms of use and pricing of this model.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with a valid payment method. Free or trial Azure subscriptions don't work. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.
- An [Azure AI Foundry project](../how-to/create-projects.md). The serverless API model deployment offering for TimeGEN-1 is only available with projects created in these regions:

    > [!div class="checklist"]
    > * East US
    > * East US 2
    > * North Central US
    > * South Central US
    > * West US
    > * West US 3
    > * Sweden Central

    For a list of  regions that are available for each of the models supporting serverless API endpoint deployments, see [Region availability for models in serverless API endpoints](deploy-models-serverless-availability.md).

- Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure AI Foundry portal. To perform the steps in this article, your user account must be assigned the __Azure AI Developer role__ on the resource group. For more information on permissions, visit [Role-based access control in Azure AI Foundry portal](../concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).


#### Estimate the number of tokens needed

Before you create a deployment, it's useful to estimate the number of tokens that you plan to consume and be billed for.
One token corresponds to one data point in your input dataset or output dataset.

Suppose you have the following input time series dataset:

| Unique_id | Timestamp           | Target Variable | Exogenous Variable 1 | Exogenous Variable 2 |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| BE        | 2016-10-22 00:00:00 | 70.00           | 49593.0              | 57253.0              |
| BE        | 2016-10-22 01:00:00 | 37.10           | 46073.0              | 51887.0              |

To determine the number of tokens, multiply the number of rows (in this example, two) and the number of columns used for forecastingâ€”not counting the unique_id and timestamp columns (in this example, three) to get a total of six tokens.

Given the following output dataset:

| Unique_id | Timestamp           | Forecasted Target Variable |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| BE        | 2016-10-22 02:00:00 | 46.57                      |
| BE        | 2016-10-22 03:00:00 | 48.57                      |

You can also determine the number of tokens by counting the number of data points returned after data forecasting. In this example, the number of tokens is two.

#### Estimate pricing based on tokens

There are four pricing meters that determine the price you pay. These meters are as follows:

| Pricing Meter | Description |
|--|--|
| paygo-inference-input-tokens | Costs associated with the tokens used as input for inference when *finetune_steps* = 0 |
| paygo-inference-output-tokens | Costs associated with the tokens used as output for inference when *finetune_steps* = 0 |
| paygo-finetuned-model-inference-input-tokens | Costs associated with the tokens used as input for inference when *finetune_steps* > 0 |
| paygo-finetuned-model-inference-output-tokens | Costs associated with the tokens used as output for inference when *finetune_steps* > 0 |

### Create a new deployment

These steps demonstrate the deployment of TimeGEN-1. To create a deployment:

[!INCLUDE [open-catalog](../includes/open-catalog.md)]

4. Search for and select **TimeGEN-1** to open its Details page.
1. Select **Deploy** to open a serverless API deployment window for the model.
1. Alternatively, you can initiate a deployment by starting from the **Models + endpoints** page in AI Foundry portal.
    1. From the left navigation pane of your project, select **My assets** > **Models + endpoints**.
    1. Select **+ Deploy model** > **Deploy base model**.
    1. Search for and select **TimeGEN-1**. to open the Model's Details page.
    1. Select **Confirm** to open a serverless API deployment window for the model.
1. Your current project is specified for the deployment. To successfully deploy the TimeGEN-1 model, your project must be in one of the regions listed in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
1. In the deployment wizard, select the link to **Azure Marketplace Terms**, to learn more about the terms of use.
1. Select the **Pricing and terms** tab to learn about pricing for the selected model.
1. Select the **Subscribe and Deploy** button. If this is your first time deploying the model in the project, you have to subscribe your project for the particular offering. This step requires that your account has the **Azure AI Developer role** permissions on the resource group, as listed in the prerequisites. Each project has its own subscription to the particular Azure Marketplace offering of the model, which allows you to control and monitor spending. Currently, you can have only one deployment for each model within a project.
1. Once you subscribe the project for the particular Azure Marketplace offering, subsequent deployments of the _same_ offering in the _same_ project don't require subscribing again. If this scenario applies to you,  there's a **Continue to deploy** option to select.
1. Give the deployment a name. This name becomes part of the deployment API URL. This URL must be unique in each Azure region.
1. Select **Deploy**. Wait until the deployment is ready and you're redirected to the Deployments page.
1. Return to the Deployments page, select the deployment, and note the endpoint's **Target** URI and the Secret **Key**. For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](#reference-for-timegen-1-deployed-as-a-serverless-api) section.
1. [!INCLUDE [Find your deployment details](../includes/find-deployments.md)]

To learn about billing for the TimeGEN-1 model deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go token-based billing, see [Cost and quota considerations for the TimeGEN-1 family of models deployed as a service](#cost-and-quota-considerations-for-timegen-1-deployed-as-a-serverless-api).

### Consume the TimeGEN-1 model as a service

You can consume TimeGEN-1 models by using the forecast API.

1. From the left navigation pane of your project, select **My assets** > **Models + endpoints**.

1. Find and select the deployment you created.

1. Copy the **Target** URI and the **Key** value.

1. Try the samples here:

| Use Case | Description | Sample Notebook |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|Quick Start Forecast|The Nixtla TimeGEN1 is a generative, pretrained forecasting model for time series data. TimeGEN1 can produce accurate forecasts for new time series without training, using only historical values as inputs.|[Quick Start Forecast](https://aka.ms/quick-start-forecasting)|
|Fine-tuning|Fine-tuning is a powerful process to utilize Time-GEN1 more effectively. Foundation models - for example, TimeGEN1 - are pretrained on vast amounts of data, to capture wide-ranging features and patterns. These models can then be specialized for specific contexts or domains. Fine-tuning refines the model parameters to forecast a new task, allowing it to tailor its vast pre-existing knowledge towards the requirements of the new data. In this way, fine-tuning serves as a crucial bridge, linking the broad TimeGEN1 capabilities to the specifics of your tasks. Concretely, the fine-tuning process involves performing some training iterations on your input data, to minimize the forecasting error. The forecasts are produced with the updated model. To control the number of iterations, use the finetune_steps argument of the forecast method.|[Fine-tuning](https://aka.ms/finetuning-TimeGEN1)|
|Anomaly Detection|Anomaly detection in time series data is important across various industries - for example, finance and healthcare. It involves monitoring ordered data points to spot irregularities that might signal issues or threats. Organizations can then swiftly act to prevent, improve, or safeguard their operations.|[Anomaly Detection](https://aka.ms/anomaly-detection)|
|Exogenous Variables|Exogenous variables are external factors that can influence forecasts. These variables take on one of a limited, fixed number of possible values, and induce a grouping of your observations. For example, if you're forecasting daily product demand for a retailer, you could benefit from an event variable that may tell you what kind of event takes place on a given day, for example 'None', Sporting', or 'Cultural'. Or you might also include external factors such as weather.|[Exogenous Variables](https://aka.ms/exogenous-variables)|
|Demand Forecasting|Demand forecasting involves application of historical data and other analytical information, to build models that help predict future estimates of customer demand, for specific products, over a specific time period. It helps shape product road map, inventory production, and inventory allocation, among other things.|[Demand Forecasting](https://aka.ms/demand-forecasting-with-TimeGEN1)|

## Cost and quotas

### Cost and quota considerations for TimeGEN-1 deployed as a serverless API

Nixtla offers TimeGEN-1 deployed as a serverless API through the Azure Marketplace. TimeGEN-1 is integrated with Azure AI Foundry for use. You can find more information about Azure Marketplace pricing when you deploy the model.

Each time a project subscribes to a given offer from the Azure Marketplace, a new resource is created to track the costs associated with its consumption. The same resource is used to track costs associated with inference; however, multiple meters are available to track each scenario independently.

For more information about how to track costs, visit [monitor costs for models offered throughout the Azure Marketplace](./costs-plan-manage.md#monitor-costs-for-models-offered-through-the-azure-marketplace).

Quota is managed per deployment. Each deployment has a rate limit of 200,000 tokens per minute and 1,000 API requests per minute. However, we currently limit one deployment per model per project. Contact Microsoft Azure Support if the current rate limits are insufficient for your scenarios.
