# Fine-tune Phi-3 models in Azure AI Foundry portal

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview.md)]

Azure AI Foundry lets you tailor large language models to your personal datasets by using a process known as fine-tuning. Fine-tuning provides significant value by enabling customization and optimization for specific tasks and applications. It leads to improved performance, cost efficiency, reduced latency, and tailored outputs.

In this article, you learn how to fine-tune Phi-3 family of small language models (SLMs) in Azure AI Foundry portal as a service with pay-as you go billing.

The Phi-3 family of SLMs is a collection of instruction-tuned generative text models.  Phi-3 models are the most capable and cost-effective small language models (SLMs) available, outperforming models of the same size and next size up across various language, reasoning, coding, and math benchmarks.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.
- An [AI Foundry hub](../how-to/create-azure-ai-resource.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For Phi-3 family models, the pay-as-you-go model fine-tune offering is only available with hubs created in **East US 2** regions.

- An [AI Foundry project](../how-to/create-projects.md).
- Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure AI Foundry portal. To perform the steps in this article, your user account must be assigned the __Azure AI Developer role__ on the resource group.

    For more information on permissions, see [Role-based access control in Azure AI Foundry portal](../concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).

### Subscription provider registration

Verify the subscription is registered to the `Microsoft.Network` resource provider.
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Subscriptions** from the left menu.
1. Select the subscription you want to use.
1. Select **Settings** > **Resource providers** from the left menu.
1. Confirm that **Microsoft.Network** is in the list of resource providers. Otherwise add it.


### Data preparation

Prepare your training and validation data to fine-tune your model. Your training data and validation data sets consist of input and output examples for how you would like the model to perform.

Make sure all your training examples follow the expected format for inference. To fine-tune models effectively, ensure a balanced and diverse dataset.

This involves maintaining data balance, including various scenarios, and periodically refining training data to align with real-world expectations, ultimately leading to more accurate and balanced model responses.

Different model types require a different format of training data.

### Chat completion

The training and validation data you use **must** be formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL) document. For `Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct` the fine-tuning dataset must be formatted in the conversational format that is used by the Chat completions API.

### Example file format

```json
    {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an Xbox customer support agent whose primary goal is to help users with issues they are experiencing with their Xbox devices. You are friendly and concise. You only provide factual answers to queries, and do not provide answers that are not related to Xbox."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is Xbox better than PlayStation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize, but I cannot provide personal opinions. My primary job is to assist you with any issues related to your Xbox device. Do you have any Xbox-related issues that need addressing?"}]}

This step requires that your account has the Azure subscription permissions and resource group permissions listed in the prerequisites. Each project has its own subscription to the particular Azure AI Foundry offering, which allows you to control and monitor spending. Select **Subscribe and fine-tune**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Subscribing a project to a particular Azure AI Foundry offering (in this case, Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct) requires that your account has **Contributor** or **Owner** access at the subscription level where the project is created. Alternatively, your user account can be assigned a custom role that has the Azure subscription permissions and resource group permissions listed in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

1. Once you sign up the project for the particular Azure AI Foundry offering, subsequent fine-tuning of the _same_ offering in the _same_ project don't require subscribing again. Therefore, you don't need to have the subscription-level permissions for subsequent fine-tune jobs. If this scenario applies to you, select **Continue to fine-tune**.

1. Enter a name for your fine-tuned model and the optional tags and description.
1. Select training data to fine-tune your model. See [data preparation](#data-preparation) for more information.

## Cleaning up your fine-tuned models 

You can delete a fine-tuned model from the fine-tuning model list in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) or from the model details page. Select the fine-tuned model to delete from the Fine-tuning page, and then select the Delete button to delete the fine-tuned model.

>[!NOTE]
> You can't delete a custom model if it has an existing deployment. You must first delete your model deployment before you can delete your custom model.

## Cost and quotas

### Cost and quota considerations for Phi models fine-tuned as a service

Phi models fine-tuned as a service are offered by Microsoft and integrated with Azure AI Foundry for use. You can find the pricing when [deploying](./deploy-models-phi-3.md) or fine-tuning the models under the Pricing and terms tab on deployment wizard.

## Sample notebook

You can use this [sample notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/jobs/finetuning/standalone/chat-completion/chat_completion_with_model_as_service.ipynb)  to create a standalone fine-tuning job to enhance a model's ability to summarize dialogues between two people using the Samsum dataset. The training data utilized is the ultrachat_200k dataset, which is divided into four splits suitable for supervised fine-tuning (sft) and generation ranking (gen). The notebook employs the available Azure AI models for the chat-completion task (If you would like to use a different model than what's used in the notebook, you can replace the model name). The notebook includes setting up prerequisites, selecting a model to fine-tune, creating training and validation datasets, configuring and submitting the fine-tuning job, and finally, creating a serverless deployment using the fine-tuned model for sample inference.

## Content filtering

Models deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go are protected by Azure AI Content Safety. When deployed to real-time endpoints, you can opt out of this capability. With Azure AI content safety enabled, both the prompt and completion pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering (preview) system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions. Learn more about [Azure AI Content Safety](../concepts/content-filtering.md).
