    questions:
      - question: |
          Who is Azure AI Foundry intended for? 
        answer: |
          Azure AI Foundry is intended for AI software developers - including cloud architects and technical decision-makers who want to create generative AI applications and custom copilot experiences.
      - question: |
          How can customers access Azure AI Foundry? 
        answer: |
          Customers can explore Azure AI Foundry unauthenticated - including its cutting-edge AI capabilities. When they're ready to begin using templates, tools, and the robust model catalog to stitch together their own AI solutions, they'll be prompted to register or sign in to their Azure account. During preview, there's no extra charge for using Azure AI Foundry. When deploying solutions, Azure AI services, Azure Machine Learning, and other Azure resources used inside of Azure AI Foundry will be billed at their existing rates. Pricing is subject to change when Azure AI Foundry is generally available.
      - question: |
          What regions is Azure AI Foundry available in?
        answer: | 
          Azure AI Foundry is available in most regions where Azure AI services are available. For more information, see [region support for Azure AI Foundry](reference/region-support.md).
      - question: |
          Can I integrate Microsoft Fabric data into Azure AI Foundry? 
        answer: |
          Yes. Azure AI Foundry supports seamless access to data in the Microsoft Fabric datastore Lakehouse without having to move or copy data. Data from Amazon S3 bucket can be accessed via Fabric shortcuts in Azure AI Foundry portal directly from Amazon S3 location without having to create a copy of the data in Azure.
      - question: |
          Can I use models other than ChatGPT in Azure AI Foundry portal? 
        answer: |
          Yes. Azure AI Foundry includes a robust and growing catalog of frontier and open-source models from OpenAI, Hugging Face, Meta and more that can be applied over your data. You can even compare models by task using open-source datasets and evaluate the model with your own test data to see how the pre-trained model would perform to fit your own use case.
      - question: |
          How is the playground in Azure AI Foundry portal different from the Azure OpenAI Studio playground? 
        answer: |
          The playground experiences in both Azure AI Foundry and Azure OpenAI Studio are similar; however, Azure AI Foundry provides playground experience for models in addition to those provisioned via Azure OpenAI Studio.
      - question: |
          Will there be multiple varying model benchmarks in Azure AI Foundry portal based on individual projects and data sources? 
        answer: |
          In the model benchmarks view, customers can view varying model benchmarks published by Azure AI. 
      - question: |
          Is prompt flow Microsoft's equivalent to LangChain? 
        answer: |
          Prompt flow is complementary to LangChain and Semantic Kernel and it can work with either. Prompt flow supports LLMOps for generative AI solutions, providing evaluation, connection management, and flow logic to help debug applications, manage deployment and monitor at scale.
      - question: |
          How is prompt injection handled, and how do we ensure no malicious code is running from prompt injection? 
        answer: |
          Prompt templates in prompt flow provide robust examples and instructions for avoiding prompt injection attacks in the application. Azure AI Content Safety helps detect offensive or inappropriate content in text and images. Content moderation also checks for jailbreaks.
      - question: |
          What is the billing model for Model-as-a-Service (MaaS)? 
        answer: |
          Azure AI Foundry offers paygo inference APIs and hosted fine-tuning for [Llama 2 family models](how-to/deploy-models-llama.md). During preview, there's no extra charge for Azure AI Foundry outside of typical AI services and other Azure resource charges.
      - question: |
          Can all models be secured with content filtering? 
        answer: |
          Azure AI Content Safety can be used for AI-generated content from Azure OpenAI Service, open-source, and frontier models. For more information, see [How Azure AI Content Safety helps protect users from the classroom to the chatroom](https://aka.ms/contentsafety_GA_blog).
      - question: |
          Do you use my company data to train any of the models? 
        answer: |
          Azure OpenAI Service doesn't use customer data to retrain models. For more information, see the [Azure OpenAI data, privacy, and security guide](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context).
