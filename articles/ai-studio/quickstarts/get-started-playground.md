# Quickstart: Use the chat playground in Azure AI Foundry portal

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview.md)]

In this quickstart, you use [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) to deploy a chat model and use it in the chat playground in Azure AI Foundry portal.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">create one for free</a>.

## Prerequisites

- You need permissions to create an Azure AI Foundry hub or have one created for you.
    - If your role is **Contributor** or **Owner**, you can follow the steps in this tutorial.
    - If your role is **Azure AI Developer**, the hub must already be created before you can complete this tutorial. Your user role must be **Azure AI Developer**, **Contributor**, or **Owner** on the hub. For more information, see [hubs](../concepts/ai-resources.md) and [Azure AI roles](../concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).

- Your subscription needs to be below your [quota limit](../how-to/quota.md) to [deploy a new model in this tutorial](#deploy-a-chat-model). Otherwise you already need to have a [deployed chat model](../how-to/deploy-models-openai.md).


## Deploy a chat model

[!INCLUDE [deploy-model](../includes/deploy-model.md)]

7. Once the model is deployed, select **Open in playground** to test your model.

You're now in a project, with a deployed model.  You can use the chat playground to interact with your model.

For more information about deploying models, see [how to deploy models](../how-to/deploy-models-openai.md).

## Chat in the playground without your data

In the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) playground, you can observe how your model responds with and without your data. In this quickstart, you test your model without your data.

To chat with your deployed model in the chat playground, follow these steps:

1. In the **System message** text box, provide this prompt to guide the assistant: "You're an AI assistant that helps people find information." You can tailor the prompt for your scenario.
1. Optionally, add a safety system message by selecting the **Add section** button, then **Safety system messages**. Choose from the prebuilt messages, and then edit them to your needs.

1. Select **Apply changes** to save your changes, and when prompted to see if you want to update the system message, select **Continue**. 
1. In the chat session pane, enter the following question: "How much do the TrailWalker hiking shoes cost?"
1. Select the right arrow icon to send.

1. The assistant either replies that it doesn't know the answer or provides a generic response. For example, the assistant might say, "The price of TrailWalker hiking shoes can vary depending on the brand, model, and where you purchase them." The model doesn't have access to current product information about the TrailWalker hiking shoes.

Next, you can add your data to the model to help it answer questions about your products. Try the [Deploy an enterprise chat web app](../tutorials/deploy-chat-web-app.md) tutorial to learn more.
