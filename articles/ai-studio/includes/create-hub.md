> [!NOTE]
> A hub in Azure AI Foundry portal is a one-stop shop where you manage everything your AI project needs, like security and resources, so you can develop and test faster. To learn more about how hubs can help you, see the [Hubs and projects overview](/azure/ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources) article.

To create a hub in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com), follow these steps:

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure account.
1. If youâ€™re not already in a project, select one. It doesn't matter which one you select.  If you have no projects, first create one by selecting **+ Create project** at the top of the page.
1. Select the **Management center** from the left menu.

1. In the **Create a new hub** dialog, enter a name for your hub (such as *contoso-hub*) and modify the other fields as desired. By default, a new AI services connection is created for the hub.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see (new) before the **Resource group** and **Connect Azure AI Services** entries then an existing resource is being used. For the purposes of this tutorial, create a separate entity via **Create new resource group** and **Create new AI Services**. This will allow you to prevent any unexpected charges by deleting the entities after the tutorial.


1. Select **Next**, review the information, and then select **Create**.

1. You can view the progress of the hub creation in the wizard.
