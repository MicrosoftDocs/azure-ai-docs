To work with a model, you first deploy it into a project. If you don't yet have a project, you create one as part of the deployment step.

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com).
1. Studio remembers where you were last, so what you do next depends on where you are:

    * If you're new to Azure AI Foundry, select **Explore models**.

    * If you have projects but aren't in one, select the project you wish to use, then select **Model catalog** from the left navigation pane. Or, you can select **Model catalog and benchmarks** at the bottom of the screen.
    * If you are in a project, select **Model catalog** from the left navigation pane.

1. Select the **gpt-4o-mini** model from the list of models. You can use the search bar to find it.

1. On the model details page, select **Deploy**.

1. If you're already in a project, the model is deployed to that project. If you aren't yet in a project, you see a form to allow you to **Select or create a project**:
 
    * If you have a project you want to use, select it.
    * If you don't yet have a project:
        1. Select **Create a new project**.
        1. Provide a name for your project.
        1. Select **Create a project**.

1. Leave the default **Deployment name**. Select **Connect and deploy**.
