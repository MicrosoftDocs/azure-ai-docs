Your project connection string is required to call the Azure OpenAI service from your code. In this quickstart, you save this value in a `.env` file, which is a file that contains environment variables that your application can read. 

Create a `.env` file, and paste the following code:

```text
PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING=<your-connection-string>
```

You find your connection string in the Azure AI Foundry project you created in the [AI Foundry playground quickstart](../quickstarts/get-started-playground.md).  Open the project, then find the connection string on the **Overview** page.  Copy the connection string and paste it into the `.env` file.

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that your `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file so that you don't accidentally check it into your git repository.
