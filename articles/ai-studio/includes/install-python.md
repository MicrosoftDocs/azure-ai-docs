First you need to create a new Python environment to use to install the package you need for this tutorial. DO NOT install packages into your global python installation. You should always use a virtual or conda environment when installing python packages, otherwise you can break your global install of Python.

### If needed, install Python

We recommend using Python 3.10 or later, but having at least Python 3.8 is required. If you don't have a suitable version of Python installed, you can follow the instructions in the [VS Code Python Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter) for the easiest way of installing Python on your operating system.

### Create a virtual environment

If you already have Python 3.10 or higher installed, you can create a virtual environment using the following commands:

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\scripts\activate
```

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

# [macOS](#tab/macos)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

Activating the Python environment means that when you run ```python``` or ```pip``` from the command line, you then use the Python interpreter contained in the ```.venv``` folder of your application.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the ```deactivate``` command to exit the python virtual environment, and can later reactivate it when needed.
