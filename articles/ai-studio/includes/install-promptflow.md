Use pip to install the prompt flow SDK into the virtual environment that you created.
```
pip install promptflow
pip install azure-identity
```

The prompt flow SDK takes a dependency on multiple packages, that you can choose to separately install if you don't want all of them:
 * ```promptflow-core```: contains the core prompt flow runtime used for executing LLM code
 * ```promptflow-tracing```: lightweight library used for emitting OpenTelemetry traces in standards
 * ```promptflow-devkit```: contains the prompt flow test bed and trace viewer tools for local development environments
 * ```openai```: client libraries for using the Azure OpenAI service
 * ```python-dotenv```: used to set environment variables by reading them from ```.env``` files
