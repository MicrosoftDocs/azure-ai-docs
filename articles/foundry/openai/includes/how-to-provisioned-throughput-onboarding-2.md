## Hourly usage

Regional Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned deployments are charged an hourly rate ($/PTU/hr) on the number of PTUs that have been deployed.  For example, a 300 PTU deployment will be charged the hourly rate times 300.  All Foundry model pricing is available in the Azure Pricing Calculator. 

If a deployment exists for a partial hour, it will receive a prorated charge based on the number of minutes it was deployed during the hour.  For example, a deployment that exists for 15 minutes during an hour will receive 1/4th the hourly charge.  

If the deployment size is changed, the costs of the deployment will adjust to match the new number of PTUs.

Paying for regional provisioned, data zone provisioned, and global provisioned deployments on an hourly basis is ideal for short-term deployment scenarios.  For example: Quality and performance benchmarking of new models, or temporarily increasing PTU capacity to cover an event such as a hackathon.  

Customers that require long-term usage of regional provisioned, data zone provisioned, and global provisioned deployments, however, might pay significantly less per month by purchasing a term discount via [Azure Reservations](#azure-reservations-for-foundry-provisioned-throughput) as discussed later in the article. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's not recommended to scale production deployments according to incoming traffic and pay for them purely on an hourly basis. There are two reasons for this:
> * The cost savings achieved by purchasing Azure Reservations for Foundry Provisioned Throughput, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned are significant, and it will be less expensive in many cases to maintain a deployment sized for full production volume paid for via a reservation than it would be to scale the deployment with incoming traffic.
> * Having unused provisioned quota (PTUs) doesn't guarantee that capacity will be available to support an increase in the size of the deployment when required. Quota limits the maximum number of PTUs that can be deployed, but it isn't a capacity guarantee. Provisioned capacity for each region and model dynamically changes throughout the day and might not be available when required. As a result, it's recommended to maintain a permanent deployment to cover your traffic needs (paid for via a reservation).
