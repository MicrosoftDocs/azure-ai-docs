## About reasoning models

Reasoning models can reach higher levels of performance in domains like math, coding, science, strategy, and logistics. The way these models produce outputs is by explicitly using chain of thought to explore all possible paths before generating an answer. They verify their answers as they produce them, which helps to arrive at more accurate conclusions. As a result, reasoning models might require less context prompts in order to produce effective results. 

Reasoning models produce two types of content as outputs:

* Reasoning completions
* Output completions

Both of these completions count towards content generated from the model. Therefore, they contribute to the token limits and costs associated with the model. Some models, like `DeepSeek-R1`, might respond with the reasoning content. Others, like `o1`, output only the completions.

### Reasoning content

Some reasoning models, like DeepSeek-R1, generate completions and include the reasoning behind them. The reasoning associated with the completion is included in the response's content within the tags `<think>` and `</think>`. The model can select the scenarios for which to generate reasoning content. The following example shows how to generate the reasoning content, using Python:

```python
import re

match = re.match(r"<think>(.*?)</think>(.*)", response.choices[0].message.content, re.DOTALL)

print("Response:")
if match:
    print("\tThinking:", match.group(1))
    print("\tAnswer:", match.group(2))
else:
    print("\tAnswer:", response.choices[0].message.content)
print("Model:", response.model)
print("Usage:")
print("\tPrompt tokens:", response.usage.prompt_tokens)
print("\tTotal tokens:", response.usage.total_tokens)
print("\tCompletion tokens:", response.usage.completion_tokens)
```

```console
Thinking: Okay, the user is asking how many languages exist in the world. I need to provide a clear and accurate answer. Let's start by recalling the general consensus from linguistic sources. I remember that the number often cited is around 7,000, but maybe I should check some reputable organizations.\n\nEthnologue is a well-known resource for language data, and I think they list about 7,000 languages. But wait, do they update their numbers? It might be around 7,100 or so. Also, the exact count can vary because some sources might categorize dialects differently or have more recent data. \n\nAnother thing to consider is language endangerment. Many languages are endangered, with some having only a few speakers left. Organizations like UNESCO track endangered languages, so mentioning that adds context. Also, the distribution isn't even. Some countries or regions have hundreds of languages, like Papua New Guinea with over 800, while others have just a few. \n\nA user might also wonder why the exact number is hard to pin down. It's because the distinction between a language and a dialect can be political or cultural. For example, Mandarin and Cantonese are considered dialects of Chinese by some, but they're mutually unintelligible, so others classify them as separate languages. Also, some regions are under-researched, making it hard to document all languages. \n\nI should also touch on language families. The 7,000 languages are grouped into families like Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Niger-Congo, etc. Maybe mention a few of the largest families. But wait, the question is just about the count, not the families. Still, it's good to provide a bit more context. \n\nI need to make sure the information is up-to-date. Let me think – recent estimates still hover around 7,000. However, languages are dying out rapidly, so the number decreases over time. Including that note about endangerment and language extinction rates could be helpful. For instance, it's often stated that a language dies every few weeks. \n\nAnother point is sign languages. Does the count include them? Ethnologue includes some, but not all sources might. If the user is including sign languages, that adds more to the count, but I think the 7,000 figure typically refers to spoken languages. For thoroughness, maybe mention that there are also over 300 sign languages. \n\nSummarizing, the answer should state around 7,000, mention Ethnologue's figure, explain why the exact number varies, touch on endangerment, and possibly note sign languages as a separate category. Also, a brief mention of Papua New Guinea as the most linguistically diverse country/region. \n\nWait, let me verify Ethnologue's current number. As of their latest edition (25th, 2022), they list 7,168 living languages. But I should check if that's the case. Some sources might round to 7,000. Also, SIL International publishes Ethnologue, so citing them as reference makes sense. \n\nOther sources, like Glottolog, might have a different count because they use different criteria. Glottolog might list around 7,000 as well, but exact numbers vary. It's important to highlight that the count isn't exact because of differing definitions and ongoing research. \n\nIn conclusion, the approximate number is 7,000, with Ethnologue being a key source, considerations of endangerment, and the challenges in counting due to dialect vs. language distinctions. I should make sure the answer is clear, acknowledges the variability, and provides key points succinctly.

Answer: The exact number of languages in the world is challenging to determine due to differences in definitions (e.g., distinguishing languages from dialects) and ongoing documentation efforts. However, widely cited estimates suggest there are approximately **7,000 languages** globally.

### Parameters

Reasoning models support a subset of the standard chat completion parameters to maintain the integrity of their reasoning process.

**Supported parameters:**
- `max_tokens` - Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response
- `stop` - Sequences where the API stops generating tokens
- `stream` - Enable streaming responses
- `n` - Number of completions to generate

**Unsupported parameters** (reasoning models don't support these):
- `temperature` - Fixed to optimize reasoning quality
- `top_p` - Not configurable for reasoning models
- `presence_penalty` - Not available
- `repetition_penalty` - Not available for reasoning models

**Example using `max_tokens`:**

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="DeepSeek-R1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}
    ],
    max_tokens=1000  # Limit response length
)
```

For the complete list of supported parameters, see the [Chat completions API reference](../../openai/latest.md#create-chat-completion).
