# Use your own resources

Use this article if you want to set up your Foundry project with your own resources.

## Limitations

**Use Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL to store threads**  
- Your existing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account used in a [standard setup](#choose-basic-or-standard-agent-setup) must have a total throughput limit of at least 3000 RU/s. Both provisioned throughput and serverless are supported.
- Three containers will be provisioned in your existing Cosmos DB account, each requiring 1000 RU/s

> [!NOTE]
> * Make sure your Azure OpenAI resource and Azure AI Foundry account and project are in the same region. 

## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
* Ensure that the individual creating the account and project has the **Azure AI Account Owner** role at the subscription scope
* If configuring a [standard setup](#choose-basic-or-standard-agent-setup), the same individual must also have permissions to assign roles to required resources (Cosmos DB, Search, Storage). For more information about RBAC in Azure AI Foundry, see [RBAC in Azure AI Foundry](../../../ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-azure-ai-foundry.md).
    * The built-in role needed is **Role Based Access Administrator**.
    * Alternatively, having the **Owner** role at the subscription level also satisfies this requirement.
    * The key permission needed is: `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`

* Register providers. The following providers must be registered:
    * `Microsoft.KeyVault`
    * `Microsoft.CognitiveServices`
    * `Microsoft.Storage`
    * `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices`
    * `Microsoft.Search`
    * `Microsoft.App`
    * `Microsoft.ContainerService`
    * To use the [Grounding with Bing Search tool](./tools/bing-grounding.md): `Microsoft.Bing`

    ```console
       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.KeyVault'
       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices'
       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Storage'
       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.MachineLearningServices'
       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Search'
       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.App'
       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.ContainerService'
       # only to use Grounding with Bing Search tool
       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Bing'
    ```

## Choose basic or standard agent setup

To use your own resources, you can edit the parameters in the provided deployment templates. To start, determine if you want to edit the [basic agent setup template](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup/42-basic-agent-setup-with-customization), or the [standard agent setup template](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup/43-standard-agent-setup-with-customization).
   
**Basic Setup**

This setup is compatible with OpenAI Assistants and manages agent states using the platform's built-in storage. It includes the same tools and capabilities as the Assistants API, with added support for non-OpenAI models and tools such as Azure AI Search, and Bing. 

**Standard Setup**

Includes everything in the basic setup and fine-grained control over your data by allowing you to use your own Azure resources. All customer dataâ€”including files, threads, and vector stores are stored in your own Azure resources, giving you full ownership and control.

## Basic agent setup: Use an existing Azure OpenAI resource 

Replace the parameter value for `existingAoaiResourceId` with the full arm resource ID of the Azure OpenAI resource you want to use.

1. To get the Azure OpenAI account resource ID, sign in to the Azure CLI and select the subscription with your AI Services account:
       
    ```console
    az login
    ``` 

2. Replace `<your-resource-group>` with the resource group containing your resource and `your-azure-openai-resource-name` with the name of your AI Service resource, and run:
    
    ```console
    az cognitiveservices account show --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-ai-service-resource-name> --query "id" --output tsv
    ```

    The value returned is the `existingAoaiResourceId` you need to use in the template.

3. In the [basic agent template file](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup/42-basic-agent-setup-with-customization/main.bicep), replace the following placeholder:
    
    ```console
    existingAoaiResourceId:/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{serviceName}
    ```

## Standard agent setup: Use existing service resources and storage accounts 

Use an existing Azure OpenAI, Azure Storage account, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account and/or Azure AI Search resource by providing the full ARM resource ID in the [standard agent template file](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup/43-standard-agent-setup-with-customization/main.bicep).

### Use an existing Azure OpenAI resource

1. Follow the steps in basic agent setup to get the AI Services account resource ID.
2. In the standard agent template file, replace the following placeholders:
    
    ```console
    existingAoaiResourceId:/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{serviceName}

    ```

### Use an existing Azure Storage account for file storage

1. To get your storage account resource ID, sign in to the Azure CLI and select the subscription with your storage account: 
    
    ```az login``` 
2. Then run the command:

    ```az storage account show --resource-group  <your-resource-group> --name <your-storage-account>  --query "id" --output tsv```
   
     The output is the `aiStorageAccountResourceID` you need to use in the template.
   
3. In the standard agent template file, replace the following placeholders:
    
    ```
    aiStorageAccountResourceId:/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}
    ```

### Use an existing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account for thread storage
**Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**
- Your existing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL Account used in standard setup must have at least a total throughput limit of at least 3000 RU/s. Both Provisioned Throughput and Serverless are supported.
    - 3 containers will be provisioned in your existing Cosmos DB account and each need 1000 RU/s

1. To get your Azure Cosmos DB account resource ID, sign in to the Azure CLI and select the subscription with your account: 
    
    ```console
    az login
    ``` 
    
2. Then run the command:

    ```console
    az cosmosdb show --resource-group  <your-resource-group> --name <your-comosdb-account>  --query "id" --output tsv
    ```
    
     The output is the `cosmosDBResourceId` you need to use in the template.
3. In the standard agent template file, replace the following placeholders:
    
    `cosmosDBResourceId:/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/{cosmosDbAccountName}`
    
### Use an existing Azure AI Search resource

1. To get your Azure AI Search resource ID, sign into Azure CLI and select the subscription with your search resource: 
    
    ```az login```
2. Then run the command:
    
    ```az search service show --resource-group  <your-resource-group> --name <your-search-service>  --query "id" --output tsv```
3. In the standard agent template file, replace the following placeholders:

    ```
    aiSearchServiceResourceId:/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/{searchServiceName}
    ```
