## Configure and run an agent

| Component | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent     | Custom AI that uses AI models in conjunction with tools.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Tool      | Tools help extend an agent’s ability to reliably and accurately respond during conversation. Such as connecting to user-defined knowledge bases to ground the model, or enabling web search to provide current information.               |
| Thread    | A conversation session between an agent and a user. Threads store Messages and automatically handle truncation to fit content into a model’s context.                                                                                     |
| Message   | A message created by an agent or a user. Messages can include text, images, and other files. Messages are stored as a list on the Thread.                                                                                                 |
| Run       | Activation of an agent to begin running based on the contents of Thread. The agent uses its configuration and Thread’s Messages to perform tasks by calling models and tools. As part of a Run, the agent appends Messages to the Thread. |
| Run Step  | A detailed list of steps the agent took as part of a Run. An agent can call tools or create Messages during its run. Examining Run Steps allows you to understand how the agent is getting to its results.                                |

Run the following commands to install the python packages.

```console
pip install azure-ai-projects
pip install azure-identity
```
Next, to authenticate your API requests and run the program, use the [az login](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively) command to sign into your Azure subscription.

```azurecli
az login
```

Use the following code to create and run an agent. To run this code, you will need to get the endpoint for your project. This string is in the format:

`https://<AIFoundryResourceName>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<ProjectName>`

[!INCLUDE [endpoint-string-portal](endpoint-string-portal.md)]

For example, your endpoint may look something like:

`https://myresource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/myproject`

Set this endpoint as an environment variable named `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`.

```python
import os
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.agents.models import CodeInterpreterTool

# Create an Azure AI Client from an endpoint, copied from your Azure AI Foundry project.
# You need to login to Azure subscription via Azure CLI and set the environment variables
project_endpoint = os.environ["PROJECT_ENDPOINT"]  # Ensure the PROJECT_ENDPOINT environment variable is set

# Create an AIProjectClient instance
project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=project_endpoint,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),  # Use Azure Default Credential for authentication
)

code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool()
with project_client:
    # Create an agent with the Bing Grounding tool
    agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(
        model=os.environ["MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],  # Model deployment name
        name="my-agent",  # Name of the agent
        instructions="You are a helpful agent",  # Instructions for the agent
        tools=code_interpreter.definitions,  # Attach the tool
    )
    print(f"Created agent, ID: {agent.id}")

    # Create a thread for communication
    thread = project_client.agents.threads.create()
    print(f"Created thread, ID: {thread.id}")
    
    # Add a message to the thread
    message = project_client.agents.messages.create(
        thread_id=thread.id,
        role="user",  # Role of the message sender
        content="What is the weather in Seattle today?",  # Message content
    )
    print(f"Created message, ID: {message['id']}")
    
    # Create and process an agent run
    run = project_client.agents.runs.create_and_process(thread_id=thread.id, agent_id=agent.id)
    print(f"Run finished with status: {run.status}")
    
    # Check if the run failed
    if run.status == "failed":
        print(f"Run failed: {run.last_error}")
    
    # Fetch and log all messages
    messages = project_client.agents.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
    for message in messages:
        print(f"Role: {message.role}, Content: {message.content}")
    
    # Delete the agent when done
    project_client.agents.delete_agent(agent.id)
    print("Deleted agent")
```
