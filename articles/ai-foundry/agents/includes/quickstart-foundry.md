## Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Ensure that the individual creating the account and project has the **Azure AI Account Owner** role at the subscription scope, which will grant the necessary permissions for creating the project
    * Alternatively, having the **Contributor** or **Cognitive Services Contributor** role at the subscription level will allow the creation of the project
- Once the project is created, ensure that the individual creating the agent within the project has the **Azure AI User** role at the project level


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure AI Foundry portal only supports basic agent setup at this time. If you want to perform a standard agent setup, see the [Environment setup](../environment-setup.md) article to learn about more.
