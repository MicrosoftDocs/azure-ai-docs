> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in May 2025, the Azure AI Agent Service uses an endpoint for [Foundry projects](../../what-is-foundry.md#types-of-projects) instead of the connection string that was previously used for hub-based projects. If you're using a hub-based project, you won't be able to use the current versions of the SDK and REST API. For more information, see [SDK usage with hub-based projects](../how-to/use-your-own-resources.md#sdk-usage-with-hub-based-projects).
