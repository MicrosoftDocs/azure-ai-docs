# Set up your environment

Creating your first agent with Azure AI Foundry Agent Service is a two-step process: 
1. Set up your agent environment.
1. Create and configure your agent using either the SDK of your choice or the Azure Foundry Portal. 

Use this article to learn more about setting up your agent environment.

### Required permissions

|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Create an account and project                                          | Azure AI Account Owner           |
| [standard setup](#choose-your-setup) Only: Assign RBAC for required resources (Cosmos DB, Search, Storage, etc.) | Role Based Access Control Administrator  |
| Create and edit agents                                                 | Azure AI User                    |

## Set up your agent environment
To get started, you need an Azure AI Foundry resource and a Foundry project.  
Agents are created within a specific project, and each project acts as an isolated workspace. This means:
* All agents in the same project share access to the same file storage, thread storage (conversation history), and search indexes.
* Data is isolated between projects. Agents in one project cannot access resources from another.
Projects are currently the unit of sharing and isolation in Foundry. See the [what is AI foundry](../../ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md) article for more information on Foundry projects.

### Prerequisites 

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
* Ensure that the individual creating the account and project has the **Azure AI Account Owner** role at the subscription scope
* If configuring a [standard setup](#choose-your-setup), the same individual must also have permissions to assign roles to required resources (Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage). For more information on RBAC roles, specific to Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, see [Azure AI Foundry Agent Service RBAC roles](../concepts/rbac-azure-ai-foundry.md).
    * The built-in role needed is **Role Based Access Administrator**.
    * Alternatively, having the **Owner** role at the subscription level also satisfies this requirement.
    * The key permission needed is: `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`

### Choose your setup
Azure AI Foundry Agent Service offers three environment configuration modes to suit different needs: 

- **Basic Setup**:  

   This setup is compatible with OpenAI Assistants and manages agent states using the platform's built-in storage. It includes the same tools and capabilities as the Assistants API, with added support for non-OpenAI models and tools such as Azure AI Search, and Bing. 

- **Standard Setup**:  

   Includes everything in the basic setup and fine-grained control over your data by allowing you to use your own Azure resources. All customer data—including files, threads, and vector stores—are stored in your own Azure resources, giving you full ownership and control. 

- **Standard Setup with Bring Your Own (BYO) Virtual Network**:  

   Includes everything in the Standard Setup, with the added ability to operate entirely within your own virtual network. This setup supports Bring Your Own Virtual Network (BYO virtual network), allowing for strict control over data movement and helping prevent data exfiltration by keeping traffic confined to your network environment.

### [Optional] Model selection in autodeploy template

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don't change the modelFormat parameter.** 
>
> The templates only support deployment of Azure OpenAI models. See which Azure OpenAI models are supported in the [model support](./concepts/model-region-support.md) article.

You can customize the model used by your agent by editing the model parameters in the autodeploy template. To deploy a different model, you need to update at least the `modelName` and `modelVersion` parameters. 

By default, the deployment template is configured with the following values:

| Model Parameter  | Default Value  |
|------------------|----------------|
| modelName        | gpt-4o         |
| modelFormat      | OpenAI (for Azure OpenAI) |
| modelVersion     | 2024-11-20     |
| modelSkuName     | GlobalStandard |
| modelLocation    | eastus         |
