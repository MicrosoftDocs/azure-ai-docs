# Set up your development environment

Set up your development environment to use the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) SDK. You also need Azure CLI for authentication so that your code can access your user credentials.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).


## Install your programming language 

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

In the IDE of your choice, create a new folder for your project. Open a terminal window in that folder.

[!INCLUDE [Install Python](../../includes/install-python.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

[!INCLUDE [Install Jave](../../includes/install-java.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

[!INCLUDE [install-csharp](../../includes/install-csharp.md)]

::: zone-end

<a name="installs"></a>

##  Install the Azure CLI and sign in 

[!INCLUDE [Install the Azure CLI](../../includes/install-cli.md)]

Keep this terminal window open to run your scripts from here as well, now that you've signed in.
