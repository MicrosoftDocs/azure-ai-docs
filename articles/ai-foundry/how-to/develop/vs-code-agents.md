# Work with Azure AI Agent Service in Visual Studio Code (Preview)

After you [get started with the AI Foundry the VS Code extension](./get-started-projects-vs-code.md), you can work with [Azure AI Agent Service](/azure/ai-services/agents/overview). Agents are "smart" microservices that:

- Answer questions using their training data or search other sources with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Perform specific actions
- Automate complete workflows

Agents combine AI models with tools to access and interact with your data.

Azure AI Foundry developers can stay productive by developing, testing, and deploying agents in the familiar and powerful environment of VS Code.

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview.md)]

###	Create and edit Azure AI Agents within the designer view

Follow these steps to create an Azure AI Agent:

1. First, finish the [Get Started](./get-started-projects-vs-code.md#get-started) section to sign in to your Azure resources and set your default project.
 
1. [Deploy a model](./get-started-projects-vs-code.md#deploy-a-model-from-the-model-catalog) to use with your agent.

1. In the Azure AI Foundry Extension view, find the **Resources** section.

1. Select the **+** (plus) icon next to the **Agents** subsection to create a new AI Agent.

     :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/select-agent-plus.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the plus sign next to the Agents subsection.":::

1. In the **Save As** dialog box, select a directory and enter a name for your new AI Agent .yaml file. 

1. Select the **Save Agent File** button to save your AI Agent file.

     :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/enter-agent-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the VS Code Save As dialog to save the agent yaml file." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/enter-agent-name.png":::

### Interact with your agent in the designer

After you choose your save location, both the agent .yaml file and the Designer view will open to edit your AI Agent.

1. Perform the following tasks in the agent designer:

    1. Enter a name for your agent in the prompt.

    1. Enter your model deployment name. The deployment name you chose when you deployed an existing model.

        > [!TIP]
        > The model deployment name must be the exact name you chose for the model you deployed in your Azure AI Foundry project. In the following image, `gpt-4o-1` is the model deployment name you chose at deployment. `gpt-4o` is the model name. 
        >  :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/deployment-model-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the highlighted deployment model names, an arrow between them, and the model name highlighted in a different color." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/deployment-model-name.png":::

    1. Configure the following fields. The **ID** is generated by the extension:
    
       - Add a description for your agent
       - Set system instructions 
       - Configure tools for agent use

        :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-designer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Agent designer that enables you to edit and interact with your AI Agent." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-designer.png":::
 
    1. To save the .yaml file, select **File** > **Save** in the VS Code menu bar.

###	Explore the Azure AI Agent YAML definition

Your AI Agent .yaml file was opened at the same time the designer was. This file contains the details and setup information for your agent, similar to the following .yaml file example: 

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://aka.ms/ai-foundry-vsc/agent/1.0.0
version: 1.0.0
name: my-agent
description: Description of the agent
id: ''
metadata:
  authors:
    - author1
    - author2
  tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
model:
  id: 'gpt-4o-1'
  options:
    temperature: 1
    top_p: 1
instructions: Instructions for the agent
tools: []
```

### Add tools to the Azure AI Agent

Azure AI Agent Service has a set of tools that you can use to interact with your data sources, such as:
 - Grounding with Bing search
 - Azure AI Search 
 - Azure Functions 
 - File retrieval 
 - Code interpreter

#### Create the tool configuration file

The Agent Designer adds tools to an AI Agent via .yaml files. 

Create a tool configuration .yaml file using the following steps:

1. Perform any setup steps that might be required. See the article for the tool you’re interested in using. For example, [Grounding with Bing search](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding?tabs=python&pivots=overview#setup).

1. Once you complete the setup, create a yaml code file that specifies the tool’s configuration. For example, this format for Grounding with Bing Search:

    ```yml
    type: bing_grounding
    name: bing_search
    configuration:
      tool_connections:
        - >-
          /subscriptions/<Azure Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Azure Resource Group name>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<Azure AI Foundry Project name>/connections/<Bing connection name>
    ```
1. Replace the placeholders in the connection string under the `tool_connections` section with your information: 
    
    - Azure Subscription ID
    - Azure Resource Group name
    - Azure AI Foundry Project name
    - Bing connection name

1. To save the .yaml file, select **File** > **Save** in the VS Code menu bar.

#### Add the tool to the AI Agent

Add a tool to the AI Agent with the following steps:

1. Select the **+** (plus) icon next to the **TOOL** section in the designer.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-tool-plus.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Agent designer TOOL section with the plus icon highlighted." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-tool-plus.png":::

1. In the file explorer that appears, select the .yaml tool file to use. Select the **Select a tool file** button to add the tool to the agent.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-select-tool-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the file explorer with the selected file and the 'Select a tool file' button highlighted." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-select-tool-file.png":::

1. The tool is displayed in the **TOOL** section. 

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-added-tool.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Agent designer TOOL section with the new tool highlighted." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-added-tool.png":::

1. To save the .yaml file, select **File** > **Save** in the VS Code menu bar.


###	Deploy Azure AI Agents to the Azure AI Foundry Studio

Deploy your agent directly to Azure AI Foundry with the following steps:

1.  Select the **Deploy to Azure AI Foundry** button in the bottom-left of the designer.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-deploy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Agent designer with the 'Deploy to Azure AI Foundry' button highlighted." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-deploy.png":::

1. In the VS Code navbar, refresh the **Azure Resources** view. The deployed agent is displayed under the **Agents** subsection.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-deployed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Azure Resources' view. The deployed agent is highlighted under the 'Agents' subsection." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-deployed.png":::

#### View the deployed AI Agent details

Selecting the deployed agent opens the **Agent Preferences** page in a view only mode.  

- Select the **Open Yaml File** to view the yaml definition of the agent. 

- Select the **Open Playground** button to open the **Agent Playground**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/deployed-agent-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Agent Preferences page with the 'Open Yaml File' and 'Open Playground' buttons highlighted." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/deployed-agent-view.png":::


### Interact with Agents using agents playground

Open the **Agents Playground** using the following steps:

1. Right-click on your deployed agent and select the **Open Playground** option This action starts a thread with your agent and let you send messages.

1. The **Playground** page is displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-display-playground.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Agents Playground** page in VS Code." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-display-playground.png":::

1. Type your prompt and see the outputs. 

## Explore Threads

The **Threads** subsection displays the threads created during a run with your agent. In the Azure Resources Extension view, select the **caret** icon in front of the **Threads** subsection to view the list of threads.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/thread-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the threads in the Threads subsection." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/thread-list.png":::



###  View thread details

Select a thread to view its details. The **Thread Details** page is displayed. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/thread-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the thread details view." lightbox="../../media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/thread-view.png":::

- A **Thread** is a conversation session between an agent and a user. Threads store **Messages** and automatically handle truncation to fit content into a model’s context.

- A **Message** is a single interaction between the agent and the user. Messages can include text, images, and other files. Messages are stored as a list on the Thread.

- A **Run** is a single execution of an agent. Each run can have multiple threads, and each thread can have multiple messages. The agent uses its configuration and Thread’s Messages to perform tasks by calling models and tools. As part of a Run, the agent appends Messages to the Thread.
