# Get started with an AI template

[!INCLUDE [classic-banner](../../includes/classic-banner.md)]

Streamline your code-first development with prebuilt, task-specific Azure AI templates. Benefit from using the latest features and best practices from Microsoft Azure AI, with popular frameworks like LangChain, prompt flow, and Semantic Kernel in multiple languages.

Available templates include:

* [Get started with AI chat](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-chat)
* [Get started with AI agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents)
* [Unlock insights from conversational data](https://github.com/microsoft/Conversation-Knowledge-Mining-Solution-Accelerator)

## Prerequisites

- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
