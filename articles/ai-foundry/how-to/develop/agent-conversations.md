# View Conversation results


A **Conversation" is the persistent context of an end-to-end dialogue history between a user and an agent. In the Azure AI Foundry portal, you can view **Conversation** results for your agent run along with traces in **Traces** page. 

You can search for a known Conversation ID, or search by a Response ID or Trace ID which maps to this conversation, then click **Conversation ID** to review the conversation:

- Conversation history details
- Response information and tokens in a run
- Ordered actions, run steps and tool calls
- Inputs and outputs between a user and an agent
