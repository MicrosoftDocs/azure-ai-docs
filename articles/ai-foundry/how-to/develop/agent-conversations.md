# View Conversation results


A **Conversation" is the persistent context of an end-to-end dialogue history between a user and an agent. In the Azure AI Foundry portal, you can view **Conversation** results for your agent run along with agent run and trace in Traces page. 

You can search a known Conversation ID or search a Response ID/Trace ID which this response is part of a conversation and click **Conversation ID** to review:

- Conversation details
- Response information in a run
- Ordered actions, run steps and tool calls
- Inputs and outputs between a user and an agent in a response
