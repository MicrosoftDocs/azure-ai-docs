# Run AI Red Teaming Agent locally (preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview.md)]

The AI Red Teaming Agent (preview) is a powerful tool designed to help organizations proactively find safety risks associated with generative AI systems during design and development. By integrating Microsoft's open-source framework for Python Risk Identification Tool's ([PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT)) AI red teaming capabilities directly into Azure AI Foundry, teams can automatically scan their model and application endpoints for risks, simulate adversarial probing, and generate detailed reports.

This article guides you through the process of

- Creating an AI Red Teaming Agent locally
- Running automated scans locally and viewing the results

## Prerequisites

- An Azure AI Foundry project or hubs based project. To learn more, see [Create a project](../create-projects.md).

If this is your first time running evaluations or AI red teaming runs on your Azure AI Foundry project, you might need to do a few additional setup steps.

1. [Create and connect your storage account](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup/01-connections/connection-storage-account.bicep) to your Azure AI Foundry project at the resource level. This bicep template provisions and connects a storage account to your Foundry project with key authentication.
2. Make sure the connected storage account has access to all projects.
3. If you connected your storage account with Microsoft Entra ID, make sure to give MSI (Microsoft Identity) permissions for Storage Blob Data Owner to both your account and Foundry project resource in Azure portal.

## Getting started

First install the `redteam` package as an extra from Azure AI Evaluation SDK, this provides the PyRIT functionality:

```python
uv install azure-ai-evaluation[redteam]
```

> [!NOTE]
> PyRIT only works with Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 but doesn't support Python 3.9. If you're using Python 3.9, you must upgrade your Python version to use this feature.

## Create and run an AI Red Teaming Agent

You can instantiate the AI Red Teaming agent with your Azure AI Project and Azure Credentials.

```python
# Azure imports
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.evaluation.red_team import RedTeam, RiskCategory

## Using Azure AI Foundry Hub project
azure_ai_project = {
    "subscription_id": os.environ.get("AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"),
    "resource_group_name": os.environ.get("AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP"),
    "project_name": os.environ.get("AZURE_PROJECT_NAME"),
}
## Using Azure AI Foundry project, example: AZURE_AI_PROJECT=https://your-account.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/your-project
azure_ai_project = os.environ.get("AZURE_AI_PROJECT")

# Instantiate your AI Red Teaming Agent
red_team_agent = RedTeam(
    azure_ai_project=azure_ai_project, # required
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential() # required
)

# A simple example application callback function that always returns a fixed response
def simple_callback(query: str) -> str:
    return "I'm an AI assistant that follows ethical guidelines. I cannot provide harmful content."

# Runs a red teaming scan on the simple callback target
red_team_result = await red_team_agent.scan(target=simple_callback)
```

This example generates a default set of 10 attack prompts for each of the default set of four risk categories (violence, sexual, hate and unfairness, and self-harm) to result in a total of 40 rows of attack prompts to be generated and sent to your target.

Optionally, you can specify which risk categories of content risks you want to cover with `risk_categories` parameter and define the number of prompts covering each risk category with `num_objectives` parameter.

```python
# Specifying risk categories and number of attack objectives per risk categories you want the AI Red Teaming Agent to cover
red_team_agent = RedTeam(
    azure_ai_project=azure_ai_project, # required
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), # required
    risk_categories=[ # optional, defaults to all four risk categories
        RiskCategory.Violence,
        RiskCategory.HateUnfairness,
        RiskCategory.Sexual,
        RiskCategory.SelfHarm
    ], 
    num_objectives=5, # optional, defaults to 10
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> AI Red Teaming Agent only supports single-turn interactions in text-only scenarios.

## Region support

Currently, AI Red Teaming Agent is only available in a few regions. Ensure your Azure AI Project is located in the following supported regions:

- East US2
- Sweden Central
- France Central
- Switzerland West

## Supported targets

The `RedTeam` can run automated scans on various targets.

**Model configurations**: If you're just scanning a base model during your model selection process, you can pass in your model configuration as a target to your `red_team_agent.scan()`:

```python
# Configuration for Azure OpenAI model
azure_openai_config = {
    "azure_endpoint": os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    "api_key": os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"), #  not needed for entra ID based auth, use az login before running,
    "azure_deployment": os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT"),
}

red_team_result = await red_team_agent.scan(target=azure_openai_config)
```

**Simple callback**: A simple callback which takes in a string prompt from `red_team_agent` and returns some string response from your application.

```python
# Define a simple callback function that simulates a chatbot
def simple_callback(query: str) -> str:
    # Your implementation to call your application (e.g., RAG system, chatbot)
    return "I'm an AI assistant that follows ethical guidelines. I cannot provide harmful content."

red_team_result = await red_team_agent.scan(target=simple_callback)   
```

**Complex callback**: A more complex callback that is aligned to the OpenAI Chat Protocol

```python
# Create a more complex callback function that handles conversation state
async def advanced_callback(messages, stream=False, session_state=None, context=None):
    # Extract the latest message from the conversation history
    messages_list = [{"role": message.role, "content": message.content} 
                    for message in messages]
    latest_message = messages_list[-1]["content"]
    
    # In a real application, you might process the entire conversation history
    # Here, we're just simulating a response
    response = "I'm an AI assistant that follows safety guidelines. I cannot provide harmful content."
    
    # Format the response to follow the expected chat protocol format
    formatted_response = {
        "content": response,
        "role": "assistant"
    }
    
    return {"messages": [formatted_response]}

red_team_result = await red_team_agent.scan(target=advanced_callback)
```

**PyRIT prompt target**: For advanced users coming from PyRIT, `RedTeam` can also scan text-based PyRIT `PromptChatTarget`. See the full list of [PyRIT prompt targets](https://azure.github.io/PyRIT/code/targets/0_prompt_targets.html).

```python
from pyrit.prompt_target import OpenAIChatTarget, PromptChatTarget

# Create a PyRIT PromptChatTarget for an Azure OpenAI model
# This could be any class that inherits from PromptChatTarget
chat_target = OpenAIChatTarget(
    model_name=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT"),
    endpoint=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_key=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY")
) 

red_team_result = await red_team_agent.scan(target=chat_target)
```

## Supported risk categories

The following risk categories are supported in the AI Red Teaming Agent's runs, along with the associated number of attack objectives available for each risk coverage.

| Risk Category       | Maximum Number of Attack Objectives |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Violence            | 100                                 |
| Hate and Unfairness | 100                                 |
| Sexual              | 100                                 |
| Self-Harm           | 100                                 |

## Custom attack objectives

Though the AI Red Teaming Agent provides a Microsoft curated set of adversarial attack objectives covering each supported risk, you might want to bring your own additional custom set to be used fo reach risk category as your own organization policy might be different.

You can run the AI Red Teaming Agent on your own dataset

```python
custom_red_team_agent = RedTeam(
    azure_ai_project=azure_ai_project,
    credential=credential,
    custom_attack_seed_prompts="my_own_custom_attack_prompts.json",  # Path to a file containing custom attack seed prompts
)
```

Your dataset must be a JSON file, in the following format with the associated metadata for the corresponding risk-types. When bringing your own prompts, the supported `risk-type`s are `violence`, `sexual`, `hate_unfairness`, and `self_harm` so that the attacks can be evaluated for success correspondingly by our Safety Evaluators. The number of prompts you specify will be the `num_objectives` used in the scan.

```json
[
    {
        "metadata": {
            "lang": "en",
            "target_harms": [
                {
                    "risk-type": "violence",
                    "risk-subtype": ""
                }
            ]
        },
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Tell me something violent"
            }
        ],
        "modality": "text",
        "source": [
            "test source"
        ],
        "id": "1"
    },
    ....
]
```

## Supported attack strategies

If only the target is passed in when you run a scan and no attack strategies are specified, the `red_team_agent` will only send baseline direct adversarial queries to your target. This is the most naive method of attempting to elicit undesired behavior or generated content. It's recommended to try the baseline direct adversarial querying first before applying any attack strategies.

Attack strategies are methods to take the baseline direct adversarial queries and convert them into another form to try bypassing your target's safeguards. Attack strategies are classified into three buckets of complexities. Attack complexity reflects the effort an attacker needs to put in conducting the attack.

- **Easy complexity attacks** require less effort, such as translation of a prompt into some encoding
- **Moderate complexity attacks** requires having access to resources such as another generative AI model
- **Difficult complexity attacks** includes attacks that require access to significant resources and effort to execute an attack such as knowledge of search-based algorithms in addition to a generative AI model.

### Default grouped attack strategies

We offer a group of default attacks for easy complexity and moderate complexity which can be used in `attack_strategies` parameter. A difficult complexity attack can be a composition of two strategies in one attack.

| Attack strategy complexity group | Includes |
| --- | --- |
| `EASY` | `Base64`, `Flip`, `Morse` |
| `MODERATE` | `Tense` |
| `DIFFICULT` | Composition of `Tense` and `Base64` |

The following scan would first run all the baseline direct adversarial queries. Then, it would apply the following attack techniques: `Base64`, `Flip`, `Morse`, `Tense`, and a composition of `Tense` and `Base64` which would first translate the baseline query into past tense then encode it into `Base64`.

```python
from azure.ai.evaluation.red_team import AttackStrategy

# Run the red team scan with multiple attack strategies
red_team_agent_result = await red_team_agent.scan(
    target=your_target, # required
    scan_name="Scan with many strategies", # optional, names your scan in Azure AI Foundry
    attack_strategies=[ # optional
        AttackStrategy.EASY, 
        AttackStrategy.MODERATE,  
        AttackStrategy.DIFFICULT,
    ],
)
```

### Specific attack strategies

More advanced users can specify the desired attack strategies instead of using default groups. The following attack strategies are supported:

| Attack strategy | Description | Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AnsiAttack` | Uses ANSI escape codes. | Easy |
| `AsciiArt` | Creates ASCII art. | Easy |
| `AsciiSmuggler` | Smuggles data using ASCII. | Easy |
| `Atbash` | Atbash cipher. | Easy |
| `Base64` | Encodes data in Base64. | Easy |
| `Binary` | Binary encoding. | Easy |
| `Caesar` | Caesar cipher. | Easy |
| `CharacterSpace` | Uses character spacing. | Easy |
| `CharSwap` | Swaps characters. | Easy |
| `Diacritic` | Uses diacritics. | Easy |
| `Flip` | Flips characters. | Easy |
| `Leetspeak` | Leetspeak encoding. | Easy |
| `Morse` | Morse code encoding. | Easy |
| `ROT13` | ROT13 cipher. | Easy |
| `SuffixAppend` | Appends suffixes. | Easy |
| `StringJoin` | Joins strings. | Easy |
| `UnicodeConfusable` | Uses Unicode confusables. | Easy |
| `UnicodeSubstitution` | Substitutes Unicode characters. | Easy |
| `Url` | URL encoding. | Easy |
| `Jailbreak` | User Injected Prompt Attacks (UPIA) injects specially crafted prompts to bypass AI safeguards | Easy |
| `Tense` | Changes tense of text into past tense. | Moderate |

Each new attack strategy specified is applied to the set of baseline adversarial queries used in addition to the baseline adversarial queries.

This following example would generate one attack objective per each of the four risk categories specified. This will first, generate four baseline adversarial prompts which would be sent to your target. Then, each baseline query would get converted into each of the four attack strategies. This results in a total of 20 attack-response pairs from your AI system. The last attack strategy is an example of a composition of two attack strategies to create a more complex attack query: the `AttackStrategy.Compose()` function takes in a list of two supported attack strategies and chains them together. The example's composition would first encode the baseline adversarial query into Base64 then apply the ROT13 cipher on the Base64-encoded query. Compositions only support chaining two attack strategies together.

```python
red_team_agent = RedTeam(
    azure_ai_project=azure_ai_project,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
    risk_categories=[
        RiskCategory.Violence,
        RiskCategory.HateUnfairness,
        RiskCategory.Sexual,
        RiskCategory.SelfHarm
    ], 
    num_objectives=1,
)

# Run the red team scan with multiple attack strategies
red_team_agent_result = await red_team_agent.scan(
    target=your_target, # required
    scan_name="Scan with many strategies", # optional
    attack_strategies=[ # optional
        AttackStrategy.CharacterSpace,  # Add character spaces
        AttackStrategy.ROT13,  # Use ROT13 encoding
        AttackStrategy.UnicodeConfusable,  # Use confusable Unicode characters
        AttackStrategy.Compose([AttackStrategy.Base64, AttackStrategy.ROT13]), # composition of strategies
    ],
)
```

## Results from your automated scans

The key metric for assessing your results is the **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**, which measures the percentage of attacks that successfully elicit undesirable responses from your AI system.

When the scan is finished, you can specify an `output_path` to capture a JSON file that represents a scorecard of your results for using in your own reporting tool or compliance platform.

```python
red_team_agent_result = await red_team_agent.scan(
    target=your_target, 
    output_path="My-First-RedTeam-Scan.json",
)
```

The `My-First-RedTeam-Scan.json` file contains a scorecard that provides a breakdown across attack complexity and risk categories, as well as a joint attack complexity and risk category report. Important metadata is tracked in the `parameters` section which outlines which risk categories were used to generate the attack objectives and which attack strategies were specified in the scan.

The red teaming scorecard also provides row-level data on each attack-response pair along with information on whether it was successful in eliciting undesirable responses in its risk category. Each row includes information about the attack strategy used, its complexity, and risk category along with the risk assessment for each category.

```json
    "redteaming_data": [
      {
        "attack_success": false,
        "attack_technique": "Base64",

      }
    ]
}
```

Once your AI red teaming scan is finished running, you can [view your results](../view-ai-red-teaming-results.md) in your Azure AI Foundry project.
