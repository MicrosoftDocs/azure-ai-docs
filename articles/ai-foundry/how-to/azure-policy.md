# Audit and manage Azure AI Foundry hubs and projects

As a platform administrator, you can use policies to lay out guardrails for teams to manage their own resources. [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/) helps audit and govern resource state. This article explains how you can use audit controls and governance practices for [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com).

## Policies for Azure AI Foundry hubs and projects

[Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/) is a governance tool that allows you to ensure that Azure resources are compliant with your policies.

Azure Policy provides a set of policies that you can use for common scenarios with Azure AI Foundry hubs and projects. You can assign these policy definitions to your existing subscription or use them as the basis to create your own [custom definitions](#create-custom-definitions).

The following table lists the built-in policies that apply to both Azure AI Foundry and Azure Machine Learning. For a list of all Azure built-in policies, see [Built-in policies](/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once a policy is assigned, it's applied to both Azure AI Foundry and Azure Machine Learning workspaces. For example, a policy at the subscription level that disables public network access would apply to all Azure AI Foundry hubs and projects, and Azure Machine Learning workspaces.

Policies can be set at different scopes, such as at the subscription or resource group level. For more information, see the [Azure Policy documentation](/azure/governance/policy/overview).

## Assign built-in policies

To view the built-in policy definitions, use the following steps:

1. Go to __Azure Policy__ in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select __Definitions__.
1. For __Type__, select __Built-in__. For __Category__, select __Machine Learning__.

From here, you can select policy definitions to view them. While viewing a definition, you can use the __Assign__ link to assign the policy to a specific scope, and configure the parameters for the policy. For more information, see [Create a policy assignment to identify noncompliant resources using Azure portal](/azure/governance/policy/assign-policy-portal).

You can also assign policies by using [Azure PowerShell](/azure/governance/policy/assign-policy-powershell), [Azure CLI](/azure/governance/policy/assign-policy-azurecli), or [templates](/azure/governance/policy/assign-policy-template).

## Conditional access policies

To control who can access your Azure AI Foundry hubs and projects, use [Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview). To use Conditional Access for hubs, [assign the Conditional Access policy](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps) to the app named __Azure Machine Learning__. The app ID is __0736f41a-0425-bdb5-1563eff02385__. 

## Configure built-in policies

### Compute instance should have idle shutdown

This policy controls whether a compute instance should have idle shutdown enabled. Idle shutdown automatically stops the compute instance when it's idle for a specified period of time. This policy is useful for cost savings and to ensure that resources aren't being used unnecessarily.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Audit__, __Deny__, or __Disabled__. If set to __Audit__, you can create a compute instance without idle shutdown enabled and a warning event is created in the activity log.

### Compute instances should be recreated to get software updates

Controls whether compute instances should be audited to make sure they're running the latest available software updates. This policy is useful to ensure that compute instances are running the latest software updates to maintain security and performance. For more information, see [Vulnerability management](../concepts/vulnerability-management.md#compute-instance).

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Audit__ or __Disabled__. If set to __Audit__, a warning event is created in the activity log when a compute isn't running the latest software updates.

### Compute cluster and instance should be in a virtual network

Controls auditing of compute cluster and instance resources behind a virtual network.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Audit__ or __Disabled__. If set to __Audit__, you can create a compute that isn't configured behind a virtual network and a warning event is created in the activity log.

### Computes should have local authentication methods disabled.

Controls whether a compute cluster or instance should disable local authentication (SSH).

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Audit__, __Deny__, or __Disabled__. If set to __Audit__, you can create a compute with SSH enabled and a warning event is created in the activity log.

If the policy is set to __Deny__, then you can't create a compute unless SSH is disabled. Attempting to create a compute with SSH enabled results in an error. The error is also logged in the activity log. The policy identifier is returned as part of this error.

### Hubs should be encrypted with customer-managed key

Controls whether a hub and its projects should be encrypted with a customer-managed key, or with a Microsoft-managed key to encrypt metrics and metadata. For more information on using customer-managed key, see the [Customer-managed keys](../concepts/encryption-keys-portal.md) article.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Audit__ or __Deny__. If set to __Audit__, you can create a hub without a customer-managed key and a warning event is created in the activity log.

If the policy is set to __Deny__, then you can't create a hub unless it specifies a customer-managed key. Attempting to create a hub without a customer-managed key results in an error similar to `Resource 'clustername' was disallowed by policy` and creates an error in the activity log. The policy identifier is also returned as part of this error.

### Configure hubs to disable public network access

Controls whether a hub and its projects should disable network access from the public internet.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Audit__, __Deny__, or __Disabled__. If set to __Audit__, you can create a hub with public access and a warning event is created in the activity log.

If the policy is set to __Deny__, then you can't create a hub that allows network access from the public internet.

### Hubs should use private link

Controls whether a hub and its projects should use Azure Private Link to communicate with Azure Virtual Network. For more information on using private link, see [Configure a private endpoint](configure-private-link.md).

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Audit__ or __Deny__. If set to __Audit__, you can create a hub without using private link and a warning event is created in the activity log.

If the policy is set to __Deny__, then you can't create a hub unless it uses a private link. Attempting to create a hub without a private link results in an error. The error is also logged in the activity log. The policy identifier is returned as part of this error.

### Hubs should use user-assigned managed identity

Controls whether a hub is created using a system-assigned managed identity (default) or a user-assigned managed identity. The managed identity for the hub is used to access associated resources such as Azure Storage, Azure Container Registry, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Application Insights.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Audit__, __Deny__, or __Disabled__. If set to __Audit__, you can create a hub without specifying a user-assigned managed identity. A system-assigned identity is used, and a warning event is created in the activity log.

If the policy is set to __Deny__, then you can't create a hub unless you provide a user-assigned identity during the creation process. Attempting to create a hub without providing a user-assigned identity results in an error. The error is also logged to the activity log. The policy identifier is returned as part of this error.

### Configure computes to modify/disable local authentication

This policy modifies any compute cluster or instance creation request to disable local authentication (SSH).

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Modify__ or __Disabled__. If set __Modify__, any creation of a compute cluster or instance within the scope where the policy applies automatically has local authentication disabled.

### Configure hub to use private DNS zones

This policy configures a hub to use a private DNS zone, overriding the default DNS resolution for a private endpoint.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __DeployIfNotExists__. Set the __privateDnsZoneId__ to the Azure Resource Manager ID of the private DNS zone to use. 

### Configure hub to disable public network access

Configures a hub and its projects to disable network access from the public internet. Disabling public network access helps protect against data leakage risks. You can instead access your hub and projects by creating private endpoints. For more information, see [Configure a private endpoint](configure-private-link.md).

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __Modify__ or __Disabled__. If set to __Modify__, any creation of a hub within the scope where the policy applies automatically has public network access disabled.

### Configure hub with private endpoints

Configures a hub to create a private endpoint within the specified subnet of an Azure Virtual Network.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __DeployIfNotExists__. Set the __privateEndpointSubnetID__ to the Azure Resource Manager ID of the subnet.

### Configure diagnostic hub to send logs to log analytics workspaces

Configures the diagnostic settings for a hub to send logs to a Log Analytics workspace.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __DeployIfNotExists__ or __Disabled__. If set to __DeployIfNotExists__, the policy creates a diagnostic setting to send logs to a Log Analytics workspace if it doesn't already exist.

### Resource logs in hub should be enabled

Audits whether resource logs are enabled for a hub. Resource logs provide detailed information about operations performed on resources in the hub.

To configure this policy, set the effect parameter to __AuditIfNotExists__ or __Disabled__. If set to __AuditIfNotExists__, the policy audits if resource logs aren't enabled for the hub.

## Create custom definitions

When you need to create custom policies for your organization, you can use the [Azure Policy definition structure](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure-basics) to create your own definitions. You can use the [Azure Policy Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzurePolicy.azurepolicyextension) to author and test your policies.

To discover the policy aliases you can use in your definition, use the following Azure CLI command to list the aliases for Azure Machine Learning:

```azurecli
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.MachineLearningServices --expand "resourceTypes/aliases" --query "resourceTypes[].aliases[].name"
```

To discover the allowed values for a specific alias, visit the [Azure Machine Learning REST API](/rest/api/azureml/) reference.

For a tutorial (not Azure Machine Learning specific) on how to create custom policies, visit [Create a custom policy definition](/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-custom-policy-definition).
