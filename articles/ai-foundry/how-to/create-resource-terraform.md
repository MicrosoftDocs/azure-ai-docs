# Use Terraform to create Azure AI Foundry resource

In this article, you use Terraform to create an [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) resource. You learn how to use Terraform to create AI Foundry management configurations including projects, deployments, and connections. 

The examples used in article use the [AzAPI](/azure/developer/terraform/overview-azapi-provider) Terraform provider. Similar [AzureRM](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/ai_services) provider support is available via the classic `AzureRM_AIServices` module (using the `aiservices` kind as its value), but is limited in functionality to resource and deployment creation.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. You can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- [Install and configure Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure).

## Implement a basic AI Foundry configuration using Terraform code

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code for this article is located in the [Azure Terraform GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-azure-ai-foundry). You can view the log file containing the [test results from current and previous versions of Terraform](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-azure-ai-foundry/TestRecord.md). You may need to update the resource provider versions used in the template to use the latest available versions.

1. Create a directory in which to test and run the sample Terraform code and make it the current directory.

1. Create a file named `providers.tf` and insert the following code.

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup-terraform/00-basic/code/providers.tf":::

1. Create a file named `main.tf` and insert the following code.

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup-terraform/00-basic/code/main.tf":::

1. Create a file named `variables.tf` and insert the following code.

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup-terraform/00-basic/code/variables.tf"::: 

## Initialize Terraform

[!INCLUDE [terraform-init.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-init.md)]

## Create a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan.md)]

## Apply a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-apply-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-apply-plan.md)]

## Customize AI Foundry using Terraform with custom storage and security

To help meet security and compliance requirements, AI Foundry lets you customize security configurations and bring your own storage resources. For example, when using the Agent service, you may opt to bring your own Azure CosmosDB database, Azure AI Search instance, and Azure Storage Account to store your threads and messages.

See the [Azure AI Foundry Samples](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup-terraform) repository with example Terraform configurations for the most common enterprise security configurations.

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan-destroy.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan-destroy.md)]
