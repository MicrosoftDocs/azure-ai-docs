# Serp API tool for flows in Azure AI Foundry portal

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview.md)]

The prompt flow Serp API tool provides a wrapper to the [Serp API Google Search Engine Results API](https://serpapi.com/search-api) and [Serp API Bing Search Engine Results API](https://serpapi.com/bing-search-api).

You can use the tool to retrieve search results from many different search engines, including Google and Bing. You can specify a range of search parameters, such as the search query, location, and device type.

## Prerequisites
