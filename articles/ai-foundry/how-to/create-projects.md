# Create a project for Azure AI Foundry (Foundry projects)

This article describes how to create a Foundry project in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs). Projects let you organize your work, such as agents, evaluations, and files, as you build stateful apps and explore new ideas.

* [!INCLUDE [fdp-description](../includes/fdp-description.md)]

* This project type gives you access to the latest generative AI features in AI Foundry, including:

    * Agents 
    * Foundry SDK and API to build agents and switch easily between models
    * Models sold directly by Azure - Azure OpenAI, Mistral, xAI, DeepSeek, etc.
    * Partner & Community Models sold through Marketplace - Stability, Bria, Cohere, etc. 
    * Content understanding 
    * Evaluations
    * Fine-tuning
    * OpenAI SDK and API incl. Batch and Stored Completions
    * AI Services

* Do you need access to Open Source models, or PromptFlow? [Create a hub project type](../how-to/hub-create-projects.md) instead.

* See [Types of projects](../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#project-types) for more information on the different project types.

## Prerequisites

Use the following tabs to select the method you plan to use to create a [!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]:

# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/ai-foundry)

- [!INCLUDE [azure-subscription](../includes/azure-subscription.md)]
- You must be **Owner** of the subscription to have appropriate access control necessary to create the Azure AI Foundry resource that is the parent of the project.  If you don't have this access, have your administrator [create an AI Foundry resource](../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md) for you to use.  Then skip to [Create multiple projects on the same resource](#create-multiple) to create your project.


# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

- [!INCLUDE [azure-subscription](../includes/azure-subscription.md)]
- You must be **Owner** of the subscription to receive the appropriate access control needed to use the project.
- [Set up your development environment](develop/install-cli-sdk.md?tabs=python)
- Authenticate with `az login` or `az login --use-device-code` in your environment before running code.
- Complete these steps to start your Python script:
    1. Install packages: `pip install azure-identity azure-mgmt-cognitiveservices~=13.7.0b1
`. If in a notebook cell, use `%pip install` instead
`.
    1. Use `pip show azure-mgmt-cognitiveservices` to verify your version is 13.7 or greater.
    1. Start your script with the following code to create the `client` connection and variables used throughout this article.  This example creates the project in East US:
    
        :::code language="python" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/python/mslearn-resources/quickstart/create_project.py" id="create_client":::

    1. (Optional) If you have multiple accounts, add the tenant ID of the Microsoft Entra ID you wish to use into the `DefaultAzureCredential`. Find your tenant ID from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) under **Microsoft Entra ID, External Identities**.
            
        ```python
        DefaultAzureCredential(interactive_browser_tenant_id="<TENANT_ID>")
        ```
            
    1. (Optional) If you're working on in the [Azure Government - US](/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome) or [Azure operated by 21Vianet](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?regions=china-east-2%2cchina-non-regional&products=all) regions, specify the region into which you want to authenticate. You can specify the region with `DefaultAzureCredential`. The following example authenticates to the Azure Government - US region:
            
        ```python
        from azure.identity import AzureAuthorityHosts
        DefaultAzureCredential(authority=AzureAuthorityHosts.AZURE_GOVERNMENT)
        ```
    


# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

- [!INCLUDE [azure-subscription](../includes/azure-subscription.md)]
- You must be **Owner** of the subscription to receive the appropriate access control needed to use the project.
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Create a Foundry project

# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/ai-foundry)

These steps provide a way to create a new Azure resource with basic, defaulted, settings. 

> [!TIP]
> If your organization requires customized Azure configurations like alternative names, security controls or cost tags, use one of these methods instead to comply with your organization's Azure Policy compliance:
> * [Create your first AI Foundry resource](../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md) 
> * [Create an Azure AI Foundry resource using a Bicep file](./create-resource-template.md) 

To create a Foundry project in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs), follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).

1. [!INCLUDE [create-project-access](../includes/create-project-access.md)]

1. Select **Azure AI Foundry resource**, then select **Next**.
1. Provide a name for your project and select **Create**.  Or see next section for advanced options.

### Advanced options

A Foundry project is created on an `AI Foundry` resource. This resource is created for you automatically when you create the project. 

To customize the settings for your project, follow these steps:

1. In the **Create a project** form, select **Advanced options**.

1. Select an existing **Resource group** you want to use, or leave the default to create a new resource group.

    > [!TIP]
    > Especially for getting started we recommend you create a new resource group for your project. The resource group allows you to easily manage the project and all of its resources together. 

1. Select a **Location** or use the default. The location is the region where the hub is hosted. Azure AI services availability differs per region. For example, certain models might not be available in certain regions.

1. Select **Create**. You see progress of resource creation and the project is created when the process is complete.

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

To create a Foundry project:


1. Add this code to create a Foundry project, using the variables and `client` connection from the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

    :::code language="python" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/python/mslearn-resources/quickstart/create_project.py" id="create_resource_project":::


# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

<!-- To create a [!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]:

1. Authenticate to your Azure subscription from the Azure CLI with the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

    For more information on authenticating, see [Authentication methods](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

1. Create a resource group, for example in East US:

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name {my_resource_group} --location eastus
    ```

1. Now use the following commands to create a new [!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]:

    [!INCLUDE [cli-create-project](cli-create-project.md)]
 -->

CLI commands not currently available for creating a Foundry project.

## <a name="create-multiple"></a> Create multiple projects on the same resource

[!INCLUDE [create-second-fdp-project](../includes/create-second-fdp-project.md)]

## View project settings

# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/ai-foundry)

On the project **Home** page, you can find information about the project.

- Name: The name of the project appears in the top left corner. 
- Subscription: The subscription that hosts the hub that hosts the project.
- Resource group: The resource group that hosts the hub that hosts the project.


# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/python/mslearn-resources/quickstart/create_project.py" id="show_project":::

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

To view settings for the project, use the `az cognitiveservices account connection show` command. For example:

```azurecli
az cognitiveservices account connection show --name {my_project_name} --resource-group {my_resource_group}
```

---

## Delete projects

1. In [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs), open your project. 
1. Select **Management center**.
1. Select **Overview** under the **Resource** section.
1. Select any projects you no longer want to keep.
1. Select **Delete project**.

To delete the AI Foundry resource along with all its projects:

1. From the Management center, select the resource name from the Overview section to go to Azure portal.
1. From Azure portal, select **Delete** to delete the resource and all its associated projects.
