# Azure AI Foundry status dashboard 

The Azure AI Foundry Status Dashboard provides visibility into the
health and availability of key Foundry services. It's intended to help
customers monitor service status, stay informed about ongoing incidents,
and plan around scheduled maintenance windows.

This dashboard is currently in **Preview**, which means we're still
expanding coverage and improving the experience based on customer
feedback.

## Key Features

- **Live Status Indicators** for core Foundry services

- **Incident Reports** with timelines, resolutions, and root cause
  summaries

- **Planned Maintenance Notifications** with expected impact and
  duration

- **Historical Uptime** to help assess service reliability over time

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this data real-time?**  
Yes. The dashboard pulls updates in real time as the engineering and operations teams publish status changes.

**Q: What does it mean that this dashboard is in “Preview”?**  
During the Preview phase, we're gradually expanding service coverage
and refining the dashboard UI and update workflows. Some services might
not yet appear, and update timing might vary slightly. We appreciate your
patience and feedback.

**Q: Can I subscribe to updates?**  
Yes, subscription options (email, SMS, webhook) are supported in the
dashboard.

**Q: Does the dashboard cover all regions and environments?**  
Currently, the dashboard reflects status for core production services in
major regions. Expanded coverage, including specific regions, is in
progress.
