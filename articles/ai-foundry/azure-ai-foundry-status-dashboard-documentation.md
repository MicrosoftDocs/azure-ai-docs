The [Microsoft Foundry Status Dashboard](https://status.ai.azure.com/) provides visibility into the health and availability of key Foundry services. It's intended to help customers monitor service status, stay informed about ongoing incidents, and plan around scheduled maintenance windows.

This dashboard is currently in **Preview**, which means we're still expanding coverage and improving the experience based on customer feedback.

## Key Features

- **Live Status Indicators** for core Foundry services
- **Incident Reports** with timelines, resolutions, and root cause summaries
- **Historical Uptime** to help assess service reliability over time
