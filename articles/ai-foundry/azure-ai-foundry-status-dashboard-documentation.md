# Azure AI Foundry status dashboard

The Azure AI Foundry Status Dashboard provides visibility into the
health and availability of key Foundry services. It is intended to help
customers monitor service status, stay informed about ongoing incidents,
and plan around scheduled maintenance windows.

This dashboard is currently in **Preview**, which means we are still
expanding coverage and improving the experience based on customer
feedback.

## Key Features

- **Live Status Indicators** for core Foundry services

- **Incident Reports** with timelines, resolutions, and root cause
  summaries

- **Planned Maintenance Notifications** with expected impact and
  duration

- **Historical Uptime** to help assess service reliability over time
