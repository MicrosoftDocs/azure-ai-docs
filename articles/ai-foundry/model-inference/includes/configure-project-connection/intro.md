You can use Azure AI Foundry Models in your projects in Azure AI Foundry to create reach applications and interact/manage the models available. To use the Azure AI Foundry Models service in your project, you need to create a connection to the Azure AI Foundry resource (formerly known Azure AI Services).

The following article explains how to create a connection to the Azure AI Foundry resource (formerly known Azure AI Services) to use Azure AI Foundry Models.
