You can use Azure AI Foundry Models in your projects in Azure AI Foundry to create reach applications and interact/manage the models available. To use the Azure AI model inference service in your project, you need to create a connection to the Azure AI Foundry resource (formerly known Azure AI Services).

The following article explains how to create a connection to the Azure AI Foundry resource (formerly known Azure AI Services) to use Azure AI Foundry Models.

## Prerequisites

To complete this article, you need:

* An Azure subscription. If you're using [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/), you can upgrade your experience and create an Azure subscription in the process. Read [Upgrade from GitHub Models to Azure AI Foundry Models](../../how-to/quickstart-github-models.md) if that's your case.

* An Azure AI Foundry resource (formerly known as Azure AI Services). For more information, see [Create and configure all the resources for Azure AI Foundry Models](../../how-to/quickstart-create-resources.md).
