[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-studio/includes/feature-preview.md)]

This article explains how to use chat completions API with models deployed in Azure AI Foundry Models.

## Prerequisites

To use chat completion models in your application, you need:

[!INCLUDE [how-to-prerequisites](../how-to-prerequisites.md)]

[!INCLUDE [how-to-prerequisites-javascript](../how-to-prerequisites-javascript.md)]

* A chat completions model deployment. If you don't have one, read [Add and configure Foundry Models](../../how-to/create-model-deployments.md) to add a chat completions model to your resource.
      
## Use chat completions

First, create the client to consume the model. The following code uses an endpoint URL and key that are stored in environment variables.

```javascript
const client = ModelClient(
    "https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/models", 
    new AzureKeyCredential(process.env.AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL)
);
```

If you've configured the resource with **Microsoft Entra ID** support, you can use the following code snippet to create a client.

```javascript
const clientOptions = { credentials: { "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com" } };

const client = ModelClient(
    "https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/models", 
    new DefaultAzureCredential()
    clientOptions,
);
```

### Create a chat completion request

The following example shows how you can create a basic chat completions request to the model.

```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        model: "mistral-large-2407",
        messages: messages,
    }
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some models don't support system messages (`role="system"`). When you use the Azure AI model inference API, system messages are translated to user messages, which is the closest capability available. This translation is offered for convenience, but it's important for you to verify that the model is following the instructions in the system message with the right level of confidence.

The response is as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics:


```javascript
if (isUnexpected(response)) {
    throw response.body.error;
}

console.log("Response: ", response.body.choices[0].message.content);
console.log("Model: ", response.body.model);
console.log("Usage:");
console.log("\tPrompt tokens:", response.body.usage.prompt_tokens);
console.log("\tTotal tokens:", response.body.usage.total_tokens);
console.log("\tCompletion tokens:", response.body.usage.completion_tokens);
```

```console
Response: As of now, it's estimated that there are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world. However, this number can vary as some languages become extinct and new ones develop. It's also important to note that the number of speakers can greatly vary between languages, with some having millions of speakers and others only a few hundred.
Model: mistral-large-2407
Usage: 
  Prompt tokens: 19
  Total tokens: 91
  Completion tokens: 72
```

Inspect the `usage` section in the response to see the number of tokens used for the prompt, the total number of tokens generated, and the number of tokens used for the completion.

#### Stream content

By default, the completions API returns the entire generated content in a single response. If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.

You can _stream_ the content to get it as it's being generated. Streaming content allows you to start processing the completion as content becomes available. This mode returns an object that streams back the response as [data-only server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events). Extract chunks from the delta field, rather than the message field.

To stream completions, use `.asNodeStream()` when you call the model.


```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        model: "mistral-large-2407",
        messages: messages,
        stream: true,
    }
}).asNodeStream();
```

You can visualize how streaming generates content:


```javascript
var stream = response.body;
if (!stream) {
    stream.destroy();
    throw new Error(`Failed to get chat completions with status: ${response.status}`);
}

if (response.status !== "200") {
    throw new Error(`Failed to get chat completions: ${response.body.error}`);
}

var sses = createSseStream(stream);

for await (const event of sses) {
    if (event.data === "[DONE]") {
        return;
    }
    for (const choice of (JSON.parse(event.data)).choices) {
        process.stdout.write(choice.delta?.content ?? "");
    }
}
```

#### Explore more parameters supported by the inference client

Explore other parameters that you can specify in the inference client. For a full list of all the supported parameters and their corresponding documentation, see [Azure AI Model Inference API reference](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference).

```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        model: "mistral-large-2407",
        messages: messages,
        presence_penalty: "0.1",
        frequency_penalty: "0.8",
        max_tokens: 2048,
        stop: ["<|endoftext|>"],
        temperature: 0,
        top_p: 1,
        response_format: { type: "text" },
    }
});
```

Some models don't support JSON output formatting. You can always prompt the model to generate JSON outputs. However, such outputs aren't guaranteed to be valid JSON.

If you want to pass a parameter that isn't in the list of supported parameters, you can pass it to the underlying model using *extra parameters*. See [Pass extra parameters to the model](#pass-extra-parameters-to-the-model).

#### Create JSON outputs

Some models can create JSON outputs. Set `response_format` to `json_object` to enable JSON mode and guarantee that the message the model generates is valid JSON. You must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Also, the message content might be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates that the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or that the conversation exceeded the max context length.


```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant that always generate responses in JSON format, using."
        + " the following format: { \"answer\": \"response\" }." },
    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        model: "mistral-large-2407",
        messages: messages,
        response_format: { type: "json_object" }
    }
});
```

### Pass extra parameters to the model

The Azure AI Model Inference API allows you to pass extra parameters to the model. The following code example shows how to pass the extra parameter `logprobs` to the model. 


```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    headers: {
        "extra-params": "pass-through"
    },
    body: {
        model: "mistral-large-2407",
        messages: messages,
        logprobs: true
    }
});
```

Before you pass extra parameters to the Azure AI model inference API, make sure your model supports those extra parameters. When the request is made to the underlying model, the header `extra-parameters` is passed to the model with the value `pass-through`. This value tells the endpoint to pass the extra parameters to the model. Use of extra parameters with the model doesn't guarantee that the model can actually handle them. Read the model's documentation to understand which extra parameters are supported.

### Use tools

Some models support the use of tools, which can be an extraordinary resource when you need to offload specific tasks from the language model and instead rely on a more deterministic system or even a different language model. The Azure AI Model Inference API allows you to define tools in the following way.

The following code example creates a tool definition that is able to look from flight information from two different cities.


```javascript
const flight_info = {
    name: "get_flight_info",
    description: "Returns information about the next flight between two cities. This includes the name of the airline, flight number and the date and time of the next flight",
    parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            origin_city: {
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the city where the flight originates",
            },
            destination_city: {
                type: "string",
                description: "The flight destination city",
            },
        },
        required: ["origin_city", "destination_city"],
    },
}

const tools = [
    {
        type: "function",
        function: flight_info,
    },
];
```

In this example, the function's output is that there are no flights available for the selected route, but the user should consider taking a train.


```javascript
function get_flight_info(loc_origin, loc_destination) {
    return {
        info: "There are no flights available from " + loc_origin + " to " + loc_destination + ". You should take a train, specially if it helps to reduce CO2 emissions."
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Cohere models require a tool's responses to be a valid JSON content formatted as a string. When constructing messages of type *Tool*, ensure the response is a valid JSON string.

Prompt the model to book flights with the help of this function:


```javascript
var result = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        model: "mistral-large-2407",
        messages: messages,
        tools: tools,
        tool_choice: "auto"
    }
});
```

You can inspect the response to find out if a tool needs to be called. Inspect the finish reason to determine if the tool should be called. Remember that multiple tool types can be indicated. This example demonstrates a tool of type `function`.


```javascript
const response_message = response.body.choices[0].message;
const tool_calls = response_message.tool_calls;

console.log("Finish reason: " + response.body.choices[0].finish_reason);
console.log("Tool call: " + tool_calls);
```

To continue, append this message to the chat history:


```javascript
messages.push(response_message);
```

Now, it's time to call the appropriate function to handle the tool call. The following code snippet iterates over all the tool calls indicated in the response and calls the corresponding function with the appropriate parameters. The response is also appended to the chat history.


```javascript
function applyToolCall({ function: call, id }) {
    // Get the tool details:
    const tool_params = JSON.parse(call.arguments);
    console.log("Calling function " + call.name + " with arguments " + tool_params);

    // Call the function defined above using `window`, which returns the list of all functions 
    // available in the scope as a dictionary. Notice that this is just done as a simple way to get
    // the function callable from its string name. Then we can call it with the corresponding
    // arguments.
    const function_response = tool_params.map(window[call.name]);
    console.log("-> " + function_response);

    return function_response
}

for (const tool_call of tool_calls) {
    var tool_response = tool_call.apply(applyToolCall);

    messages.push(
        {
            role: "tool",
            tool_call_id: tool_call.id,
            content: tool_response
        }
    );
}
```

View the response from the model:


```javascript
var result = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        messages: messages,
        tools: tools,
    }
});
```

### Apply Guardrails and controls

The Azure AI model inference API supports [Azure AI content safety](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety). When you use deployments with Azure AI content safety turned on, inputs and outputs pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.

The following example shows how to handle events when the model detects harmful content in the input prompt and content safety is enabled.


```javascript
try {
    var messages = [
        { role: "system", content: "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information." },
        { role: "user", content: "Chopping tomatoes and cutting them into cubes or wedges are great ways to practice your knife skills." },
    ];

    var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
        body: {
            messages: messages,
        }
    });

    console.log(response.body.choices[0].message.content);
}
catch (error) {
    if (error.status_code == 400) {
        var response = JSON.parse(error.response._content);
        if (response.error) {
            console.log(`Your request triggered an ${response.error.code} error:\n\t ${response.error.message}`);
        }
        else
        {
            throw error;
        }
    }
}
```
