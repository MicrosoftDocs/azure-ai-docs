# How to use blocklists with Azure AI model inference service in Azure AI services

The configurable content filters are sufficient for most content moderation needs. However, you may need to filter terms specific to your use case. 

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you're using [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/), you can upgrade your experience and create an Azure subscription in the process. Read [Upgrade from GitHub Models to Azure AI model inference](quickstart-github-models.md) if it's your case.

* An Azure AI services resource. For more information, see [Create an Azure AI Services resource](../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?context=/azure/ai-services/model-inference/context/context).

* An Azure AI Foundry project [connected to your Azure AI services resource](configure-project-connection.md).

* A model deployment. See [Add and configure models to Azure AI services](create-model-deployments.md) for adding models to your resource.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Blocklist (preview) is only supported for Azure OpenAI models.

[!INCLUDE [use-blocklists](../../includes/use-blocklists.md)]
