# Use the Azure AI model inference endpoint to consume models

Azure AI model inference in Azure AI services allows customers to consume the most powerful models from flagship model providers using a single endpoint and credentials. This means that you can switch between models and consume them from your application without changing a single line of code.

This article explains how to use the inference endpoint to invoke them.

## Endpoints

Azure AI services expose multiple endpoints depending on the type of work you're looking for:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Azure AI model inference endpoint
> * Azure OpenAI endpoint

The **Azure AI inference endpoint** (usually with the form `https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/models`) allows customers to use a single endpoint with the same authentication and schema to generate inference for the deployed models in the resource. All the models support this capability. This endpoint follows the [Azure AI model inference API](.././reference/reference-model-inference-api.md). 

**Azure OpenAI** models deployed to AI services also support the Azure OpenAI API (usually with the form `https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com`). This endpoint exposes the full capabilities of OpenAI models and supports more features like assistants, threads, files, and batch inference.

To learn more about how to apply the **Azure OpenAI endpoint** see [Azure OpenAI service documentation](../../../ai-services/openai/overview.md).

## Using the routing capability in the Azure AI model inference endpoint

The inference endpoint routes requests to a given deployment by matching the parameter `name` inside of the request to the name of the deployment. This means that *deployments work as an alias of a given model under certain configurations*. This flexibility allows you to deploy a given model multiple times in the service but under different configurations if needed.

For example, if you create a deployment named `Mistral-large`, then such deployment can be invoked as:

[!INCLUDE [code-create-chat-client](../includes/code-create-chat-client.md)]

For a chat model, you can create a request as follows:

[!INCLUDE [code-create-chat-completion](../includes/code-create-chat-completion.md)]

If you specify a model name that doesn't match any given model deployment, you get an error that the model doesn't exist. You can control which models are available for users by creating model deployments as explained at [add and configure model deployments](create-model-deployments.md).

## Key-less authentication

Models deployed to Azure AI model inference in Azure AI Services support key-less authorization using Microsoft Entra ID. Key-less authorization enhances security, simplifies the user experience, reduces operational complexity, and provides robust compliance support for modern development. It makes it a strong choice for organizations adopting secure and scalable identity management solutions.

To use key-less authentication, [configure your resource and grant access to users](configure-entra-id.md) to perform inference. Once configured, then you can authenticate as follows:

[!INCLUDE [code-create-chat-client-entra](../includes/code-create-chat-client-entra.md)]

## Limitations

* Azure OpenAI Batch can't be used with the Azure AI model inference endpoint. You have to use the dedicated deployment URL as explained at [Batch API support in Azure OpenAI documentation](../../../ai-services/openai/how-to/batch.md#api-support).
* Real-time API isn't supported in the inference endpoint. Use the dedicated deployment URL.
