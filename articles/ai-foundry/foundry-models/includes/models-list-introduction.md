Depending on the [kind of project](../../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#work-in-an-azure-ai-foundry-project) you use in Azure AI Foundry, you see a different selection of models. Specifically, if you use a Foundry project built on an Azure AI Foundry resource, you see the models that are available for standard deployment to a Foundry resource. Alternatively, if you use a hub-based project hosted by an Azure AI Foundry hub, you see models that are available for deployment to managed compute and serverless APIs. These model selections often overlap because many models support multiple [deployment options](../../concepts/deployments-overview.md).
