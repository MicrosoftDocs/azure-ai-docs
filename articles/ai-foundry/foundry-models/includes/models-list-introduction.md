Depending on the [kind of project](../../what-is-foundry.md?view=foundry-classic&preserve-view=true#work-in-a-foundry-project) you use in Microsoft Foundry, you see a different selection of models. Specifically, if you use a Foundry project built on a Foundry resource, you see the models that are available for standard deployment to a Foundry resource. Alternatively, if you use a hub-based project hosted by a Foundry hub, you see models that are available for deployment to managed compute and serverless APIs. These model selections often overlap because many models support multiple [deployment options](../../concepts/deployments-overview.md).
