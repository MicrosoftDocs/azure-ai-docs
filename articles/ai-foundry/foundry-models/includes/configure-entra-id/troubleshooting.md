Before troubleshooting, verify that you have the right permissions assigned:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and locate the **Azure AI Foundry resource** (formerly known Azure AI Services resource) that you're using.

1. On the left pane, select **Access control (IAM)** and then select **Check access**.

1. Type the name of the user or identity you're using to connect to the service.

1. Verify that the role **Cognitive Services User** is listed (or a role that contains the required permissions as explained in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Roles like **Owner** or **Contributor** don't provide access via Microsoft Entra ID.

1. If the role isn't listed, follow the steps in this guide before continuing.

The following table contains multiple scenarios that can help troubleshooting Microsoft Entra ID:

| Error / Scenario     | Root cause    | Solution |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| You're using an SDK. | Known issues. | Before making further troubleshooting, install the latest version of the software you're using to connect to the service. Authentication bugs might already be fixed in a newer version of the software you're using. |
| `401 Principal does not have access to API/Operation` | The request indicates authentication in the correct way, but the user principal doesn't have the required permissions to use the inference endpoint. | Ensure you have: <br /> 1. Assigned the role **Cognitive Services User** to your principal to the Azure AI Foundry (formerly known Azure AI Services) resource. Notice that **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** grants only access to OpenAI models. **Owner** or **Contributor** don't provide access either.<br /> 1. Wait at least 5 minutes before making the first call. |
| `401 HTTP/1.1 401 PermissionDenied` | The request indicates authentication in the correct way, but the user principal doesn't have the required permissions to use the inference endpoint. | Assigned the role **Cognitive Services User** to your principal in the Azure AI Foundry (formerly known Azure AI Services) resource. Roles like **Administrator** or **Contributor** don't grand inference access. Wait at least 5 minutes before making the first call. |
| You're using REST API calls and you get `401 Unauthorized. Access token is missing, invalid, audience is incorrect, or have expired.` | The request fails to perform authentication with Microsoft Entra ID. | Ensure the `Authentication` header contains a valid token with a scope `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default`. |
| You're using `AzureOpenAI` class and you get `401 Unauthorized. Access token is missing, invalid, audience is incorrect, or have expired.` | The request fails to perform authentication with Microsoft Entra ID. | Ensure that you're using an **OpenAI model** connected to the endpoint `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com`. You can't use `OpenAI` class or a Models-as-a-Service model. If your model isn't from OpenAI, use the Azure AI Inference SDK. |
| You're using the Azure AI Inference SDK and you get `401 Unauthorized. Access token is missing, invalid, audience is incorrect, or have expired.` | The request fails to perform authentication with Microsoft Entra ID. | Ensure you're connected to the endpoint `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/model` and that you indicated the right scope for Microsoft Entra ID (`https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default`). |
| `404 Not found` | The endpoint URL is incorrect based on the SDK you are using, or the model deployment doesn't exist. | Ensure you are using the right SDK connected to the right endpoint: <br /> 1. If you are using the Azure AI inference SDK, ensure the endpoint is `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/model` with `model="<model-deployment-name>"` in the payloads, or endpoint is `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/deployments/<model-deployment-name>`. <br /> If you are using the `AzureOpenAI` class, ensure the endpoint is `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com`. |
