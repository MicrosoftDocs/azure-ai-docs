## Reasoning models

Reasoning models can reach higher levels of performance in domains like math, coding, science, strategy, and logistics. The way these models produce outputs is by explicitly using chain of thought to explore all possible paths before generating an answer. They verify their answers as they produce them, which helps to arrive at more accurate conclusions. As a result, reasoning models might require less context in prompting in order to produce effective results. 

This way of scaling a model's performance is referred to as *inference compute time* as it trades performance against higher latency and cost. In contrast, other approaches might scale through *training compute time*. 

Reasoning models produce two types of content as outputs:

* Reasoning completions
* Output completions

Both of these completions count towards content generated from the model. Therefore, they contribute to the token limits and costs associated with the model. Some models, like `DeepSeek-R1`, might respond with the reasoning content. Others, like `o1`, output only the completions.
