[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-studio/includes/feature-preview.md)]

This article explains how to use chat completions API with models deployed in Azure AI Foundry Models.

## Prerequisites

To use chat completion models in your application, you need:

[!INCLUDE [how-to-prerequisites](../how-to-prerequisites.md)]

* A chat completions model deployment. If you don't have one, read [Add and configure Foundry Models](../../how-to/create-model-deployments.md) to add a chat completions model to your resource.

    * This example uses `mistral-large-2407`.

## Use chat completions

To use chat completions API, use the route `/chat/completions` appended to the base URL along with your credential indicated in `api-key`. 

```http
POST https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/models/chat/completions?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: <key>
```

If you've configured the resource with **Microsoft Entra ID** support, pass you token in the `Authorization` header with the format `Bearer <token>`. Use scope `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default`. 

```http
POST https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/models/chat/completions?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Using Microsoft Entra ID might require extra configuration in your resource to grant access. Learn how to [configure key-less authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](../../how-to/configure-entra-id.md).

### Create a chat completion request

The following example shows how you can create a basic chat completions request to the model.

```json
{
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
        }
    ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some models don't support system messages (`role="system"`). When you use the Azure AI Model Inference API, system messages are translated to user messages, which is the closest capability available. This translation is offered for convenience, but it's important for you to verify that the model is following the instructions in the system message with the right level of confidence.

The response is as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics:


```json
{
    "id": "0a1234b5de6789f01gh2i345j6789klm",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1718726686,
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "As of now, it's estimated that there are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world. However, this number can vary as some languages become extinct and new ones develop. It's also important to note that the number of speakers can greatly vary between languages, with some having millions of speakers and others only a few hundred.",
                "tool_calls": null
            },
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 19,
        "total_tokens": 91,
        "completion_tokens": 72
    }
}
```

Inspect the `usage` section in the response to see the number of tokens used for the prompt, the total number of tokens generated, and the number of tokens used for the completion.

#### Stream content

By default, the completions API returns the entire generated content in a single response. If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.

You can _stream_ the content to get it as it's being generated. Streaming content allows you to start processing the completion as content becomes available. This mode returns an object that streams back the response as [data-only server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events). Extract chunks from the delta field, rather than the message field.


```json
{
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
        }
    ],
    "stream": true,
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": 1,
    "max_tokens": 2048
}
```

You can visualize how streaming generates content:


```json
{
    "id": "23b54589eba14564ad8a2e6978775a39",
    "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
    "created": 1718726371,
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "delta": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": ""
            },
            "finish_reason": null,
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ]
}
```

The last message in the stream has `finish_reason` set, indicating the reason for the generation process to stop.


```json
{
    "id": "23b54589eba14564ad8a2e6978775a39",
    "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
    "created": 1718726371,
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "delta": {
                "content": ""
            },
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 19,
        "total_tokens": 91,
        "completion_tokens": 72
    }
}
```

#### Explore more parameters supported by the inference client

Explore other parameters that you can specify in the inference client. For a full list of all the supported parameters and their corresponding documentation, see [Model Inference API reference](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference).

```json
{
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
        }
    ],
    "presence_penalty": 0.1,
    "frequency_penalty": 0.8,
    "max_tokens": 2048,
    "stop": ["<|endoftext|>"],
    "temperature" :0,
    "top_p": 1,
    "response_format": { "type": "text" }
}
```


```json
{
    "id": "0a1234b5de6789f01gh2i345j6789klm",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1718726686,
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "As of now, it's estimated that there are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world. However, this number can vary as some languages become extinct and new ones develop. It's also important to note that the number of speakers can greatly vary between languages, with some having millions of speakers and others only a few hundred.",
                "tool_calls": null
            },
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 19,
        "total_tokens": 91,
        "completion_tokens": 72
    }
}
```

Some models don't support JSON output formatting. You can always prompt the model to generate JSON outputs. However, such outputs aren't guaranteed to be valid JSON.

If you want to pass a parameter that isn't in the list of supported parameters, you can pass it to the underlying model using *extra parameters*. See [Pass extra parameters to the model](#pass-extra-parameters-to-the-model).

#### Create JSON outputs

Some models can create JSON outputs. Set `response_format` to `json_object` to enable JSON mode and guarantee that the message the model generates is valid JSON. You must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Also, the message content might be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates that the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or that the conversation exceeded the max context length.


```json
{
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant that always generate responses in JSON format, using the following format: { \"answer\": \"response\" }"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
        }
    ],
    "response_format": { "type": "json_object" }
}
```


```json
{
    "id": "0a1234b5de6789f01gh2i345j6789klm",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1718727522,
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "{\"answer\": \"There are approximately 7,117 living languages in the world today, according to the latest estimates. However, this number can vary as some languages become extinct and others are newly discovered or classified.\"}",
                "tool_calls": null
            },
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 39,
        "total_tokens": 87,
        "completion_tokens": 48
    }
}
```

### Pass extra parameters to the model

The Foundry Models Inference API allows you to pass extra parameters to the model. The following code example shows how to pass the extra parameter `logprobs` to the model. 

```http
POST https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/models/chat/completions?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
extra-parameters: pass-through
```


```json
{
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
        }
    ],
    "logprobs": true
}
```

Before you pass extra parameters to The Azure AI Model Inference API, make sure your model supports those extra parameters. When the request is made to the underlying model, the header `extra-parameters` is passed to the model with the value `pass-through`. This value tells the endpoint to pass the extra parameters to the model. Use of extra parameters with the model doesn't guarantee that the model can actually handle them. Read the model's documentation to understand which extra parameters are supported.

### Use tools

Some models support the use of tools, which can be an extraordinary resource when you need to offload specific tasks from the language model and instead rely on a more deterministic system or even a different language model. The Azure AI Model Inference API allows you to define tools in the following way.

The following code example creates a tool definition that is able to look from flight information from two different cities.


```json
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_flight_info",
        "description": "Returns information about the next flight between two cities. This includes the name of the airline, flight number and the date and time of the next flight",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "origin_city": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The name of the city where the flight originates"
                },
                "destination_city": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The flight destination city"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "origin_city",
                "destination_city"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the function's output is that there are no flights available for the selected route, but the user should consider taking a train.

> [!NOTE]
> Cohere models require a tool's responses to be a valid JSON content formatted as a string. When constructing messages of type *Tool*, ensure the response is a valid JSON string.

Prompt the model to book flights with the help of this function:


```json
{
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant that help users to find information about traveling, how to get to places and the different transportations options. You care about the environment and you always have that in mind when answering inqueries"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "When is the next flight from Miami to Seattle?"
        }
    ],
    "tool_choice": "auto",
    "tools": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_flight_info",
                "description": "Returns information about the next flight between two cities. This includes the name of the airline, flight number and the date and time of the next flight",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "origin_city": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the city where the flight originates"
                        },
                        "destination_city": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The flight destination city"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": [
                        "origin_city",
                        "destination_city"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You can inspect the response to find out if a tool needs to be called. Inspect the finish reason to determine if the tool should be called. Remember that multiple tool types can be indicated. This example demonstrates a tool of type `function`.


```json
{
    "id": "0a1234b5de6789f01gh2i345j6789klm",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1718726007,
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "",
                "tool_calls": [
                    {
                        "id": "abc0dF1gh",
                        "type": "function",
                        "function": {
                            "name": "get_flight_info",
                            "arguments": "{\"origin_city\": \"Miami\", \"destination_city\": \"Seattle\"}",
                            "call_id": null
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            "finish_reason": "tool_calls",
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 190,
        "total_tokens": 226,
        "completion_tokens": 36
    }
}
```

To continue, append this message to the chat history:

Now, it's time to call the appropriate function to handle the tool call. The following code snippet iterates over all the tool calls indicated in the response and calls the corresponding function with the appropriate parameters. The response is also appended to the chat history.

            }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Apply Guardrails and controls

The Azure AI Model Inference API supports [Azure AI Content Safety](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety). When you use deployments with Azure AI Content Safety turned on, inputs and outputs pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.

The following example shows how to handle events when the model detects harmful content in the input prompt.


```json
{
    "model": "mistral-large-2407",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information."
        },
                {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Chopping tomatoes and cutting them into cubes or wedges are great ways to practice your knife skills."
        }
    ]
}
```


```json
