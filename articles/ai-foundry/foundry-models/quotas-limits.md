# Azure AI Foundry Models quotas and limits

This article provides a quick reference and detailed description of the quotas and limits for Azure AI Foundry Models. For quotas and limits specific to the Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models, see [Quota and limits in Azure OpenAI](../openai/quotas-limits.md).

## Quotas and limits reference

Azure uses quotas and limits to prevent budget overruns due to fraud and to honor Azure capacity constraints. Consider these limits as you scale for production workloads. The following sections provide a quick guide to the default quotas and limits that apply to Azure AI model inference service in Azure AI Foundry:

### Resource limits

| Limit name | Limit value |
|--|--|
| Azure AI Foundry resources per region per Azure subscription | 100 |
| Max projects per resource | 250 |
| Max deployments per resource | 32 | 

### Rate limits

The following table lists limits for Foundry Models for the following rates:

- Tokens per minute
- Requests per minute
- Concurrent request

| Models                                                                 | Tokens per minute                                   | Requests per minute                                   | Concurrent requests   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Azure OpenAI models                                                    | Varies per model and SKU. See [limits for Azure OpenAI](../openai/quotas-limits.md). | Varies per model and SKU. See [limits for Azure OpenAI](../openai/quotas-limits.md). | not applicable       |
| - DeepSeek-R1<br />- DeepSeek-V3-0324                                      | 5,000,000                                           | 5,000                                                 | 300                  |
| - Llama 3.3 70B Instruct<br />- Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8<br />- Grok 3<br />- Grok 3 mini | 400,000                                             | 1,000                                                 | 300                  |
| - Flux-Pro 1.1<br />- Flux.1-Kontext Pro                                   | not applicable                                      | 2 capacity units (6 requests per minute)              | not applicable       |
| Rest of models                                                         | 400,000                                             | 1,000                                                 | 300                  |

To increase your quota:

- For Azure OpenAI, use [Azure AI Foundry Service: Request for Quota Increase](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR4xPXO648sJKt4GoXAed-0pUMFE1Rk9CU084RjA0TUlVSUlMWEQzVkJDNCQlQCN0PWcu) to submit your request. 
- For other models, see [request increases to the default limits](#request-increases-to-the-default-limits). 
 
Due to high demand, we evaluate limit increase requests per request.

### Other limits

| Limit name | Limit value |
|--|--|
| Max number of custom headers in API requests<sup>1</sup> | 10 |

<sup>1</sup> Our current APIs allow up to 10 custom headers, which the pipeline passes through and returns. If you exceed this header count, your request results in an HTTP 431 error. To resolve this error, reduce the header volume. **Future API versions won't pass through custom headers**. We recommend that you don't depend on custom headers in future system architectures.

## Usage tiers

Global Standard deployments use Azure's global infrastructure to dynamically route customer traffic to the data center with best availability for the customer's inference requests. This infrastructure enables more consistent latency for customers with low to medium levels of traffic. Customers with high sustained levels of usage might see more variabilities in response latency.

The Usage Limit determines the level of usage above which customers might see larger variability in response latency. A customer's usage is defined per model and is the total tokens consumed across all deployments in all subscriptions in all regions for a given tenant.

## Request increases to the default limits

[!INCLUDE [quota-increase- request](../openai/includes/quota-increase-request.md)]

## General best practices to stay within rate limits

To minimize issues related to rate limits, use the following techniques:

- Implement retry logic in your application.
- Avoid sharp changes in the workload. Increase the workload gradually.
- Test different load increase patterns.
- Increase the quota assigned to your deployment. Move quota from another deployment, if necessary.
