# What is Azure AI Foundry Overview

[Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs)is a unified Azure platform-as-a-service offering for enterprise AI operations, model builders, and application development. This foundation combines production-grade infrastructure with friendly interfaces, enabling developers to focus on building applications rather than managing infrastructure.

Azure AI Foundry unifies agents, models, and tools under a single management grouping with built-in enterprise-readiness capabilities including tracing, monitoring, evaluations, and customizable enterprise setup configurations. The platform provides streamlined management through unified Role-based access control (RBAC), networking, and policies under one Azure resource provider namespace.

[Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) is designed for developers to:

- Build generative AI applications and AI agents on an enterprise-grade platform.
- Explore, build, test, and deploy using cutting-edge AI tools and ML models, grounded in responsible AI practices.
- Collaborate with a team for the full life-cycle of application development.
- Work across model providers with a consistent API contract.

With Azure AI Foundry, you can explore a wide variety of models, services and capabilities, and get to building AI applications that best serve your goals. Azure AI Foundry facilitates scalability for transforming proof of concepts into full-fledged production applications with ease. Continuous monitoring and refinement support long-term success.  

## New user experience

Azure AI Foundry has been reimagined as the AI app and agent factory for AI development teams, ushering in a true code shift for modern builders. The new version of Azure AI Foundry portal delivers speed, simplicity, and modularity as development teams access models, integrate knowledge, and continuously monitor the AI development lifecycle. ​

The new user experience surfaces relevant models, agents, and tools contextually. Seamless transitions from playground to deployment reduce friction and empower teams to move from experimentation to production with ease. Advanced features like memory toggles, knowledge source federation, and embedded evaluation dashboards give development teams the power to design, customize, and manage AI apps and agents with confidence. ​

## Pricing and billing

Azure AI Foundry is monetized through individual products customer access and consume in the platform, including API and models, complete AI toolchain, and responsible AI and enterprise grade production at scale products. Each product has its own billing model and price. 

The platform is free to use and explore. Pricing occurs at deployment level. 

Using Azure AI Foundry also incurs cost associated with the underlying services. To learn more, read [Plan and manage costs for Azure AI services](concepts/costs-plan-manage.md).

## Region availability

Azure AI Foundry is available in most regions where Azure AI services are available. For more information, see [region support for Azure AI Foundry](../reference/region-support.md).

## How to get access

You can explore Azure AI Foundry portal without signing in. 

But for full functionality, you need an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account).
