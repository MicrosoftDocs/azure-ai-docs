# Work with Declarative (Low-code) Agent workflows in Visual Studio Code (preview)

In this article, you learn how to add and use [Foundry Agent workflows](../concepts/workflow.md) with Azure AI agents by using the [Microsoft Foundry for Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.vscode-ai-foundry).

After you [build an agent in Foundry Agent Service](
/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/vs-code-agents?view=foundry&tabs=windows-powershell&pivots=python&preserve-view=true) by using this Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension, you can add workflows to your agent.

Foundry Workflows is a UI-based tool in Foundry that creates declarative, predefined sequences of actions including agents, as in Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows.

Workflows let you build intelligent automation systems that blend AI agents with business processes in a visual way. Traditional single-agent systems struggle to handle complex tasks with many parts. When you orchestrate multiple agents, each with specialized skills or roles, you create systems that are more robust, adaptive, and capable of solving real-world problems together.

## What is a declarative agent?
A declarative agent is an AI agent that operates based on predefined rules, workflows, or configurations instead of explicit programming logic. This approach lets users define what the agent should do and how it should behave through high-level specifications. Declarative agents make it easier to create and manage complex interactions without deep coding knowledge.

## View a declarative agent workflow 
For declarative agent workflows start by creating a workflow in [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs). Then, open it directly from Foundry in VS Code.

### Open in VS Code - YAML based workflow playground


### Open in VS Code from Foundry 

## Test workflow in playground

## Convert YAML based workflow to Agent framework code

## Deploy to service

## Run in playground
