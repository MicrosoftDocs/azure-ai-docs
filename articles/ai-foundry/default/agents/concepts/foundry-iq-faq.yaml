  - name: "General"
    questions:
      - question: "What is Foundry IQ?"
        answer: |
          Foundry IQ is a unified knowledge layer for agents that's designed to improve response quality, automate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows, and enable enterprise-ready grounding.
          
          Azure AI Search provides the core components: a knowledge base that consists of one or more knowledge sources and an agentic retrieval engine. Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models adds optional query planning and reasoning. Agents built in Foundry Agent Service or other frameworks call the knowledge base to retrieve relevant content.

      - question: "Is Foundry IQ a standalone service?"
        answer: |
          No. Foundry IQ is a workload that's built on Azure AI Search and available in Microsoft Foundry. You can

      - question: "How is Foundry IQ different from existing RAG patterns or Azure OpenAI On Your Data?"
        answer: |
          With Foundry IQ, you point to one knowledge base to access multiple sources, removing the need to connect each agent to each source individually. The agentic retrieval engine plans which sources to query and performs iterative search if initial results don't meet relevance standards. Indexing and data syncing are triggered automatically.

  - name: "Components and requirements"
    questions:
      - question: "Is Azure AI Search required for Foundry IQ?"
        answer: |
          Yes. Foundry IQ is built on Azure AI Search's agentic retrieval capabilities. You must create a knowledge base in Azure AI Search to use Foundry IQ.

      - question: "Is Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models required for Foundry IQ?"
        answer: |
          No. An LLM is optional for query planning and reasoning. You can use Foundry IQ with the minimal retrieval reasoning effort to bypass LLM invocations. However, using an LLM with low or medium retrieval reasoning effort improves response quality.

      - question: "Is Foundry Agent Service required for Foundry IQ?"
        answer: |
          No. You can call the knowledge base directly from LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, AutoGen, Haystack, or any application that supports the Azure AI Search REST APIs or Azure SDKs. However, Foundry Agent Service provides a turnkey agent hosting platform with built-in support for Foundry IQ knowledge bases.

  - name: "Agentic retrieval"
    questions:
      - question: "What is agentic retrieval?"
        answer: |
          [Agentic retrieval](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-overview) is Azure AI Search's multi-turn retrieval engine for knowledge bases. It selects which knowledge sources to query, routes requests appropriately, and can automatically iterate when initial results are incomplete. When configured with an LLM, agentic retrieval also performs query planning and higher‑level reasoning to refine the search process. Benchmarks show approximately 36% higher response quality compared to traditional single‑shot RAG.

      - question: "What is the retrieval reasoning effort?"
        answer: |
            The [retrieval reasoning effort](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-set-retrieval-reasoning-effort) determines how much LLM-driven planning is used during agentic retrieval. Levels range from minimal to medium, influencing how deeply the system interprets the query, selects sources, and decides whether additional retrieval steps are needed. 

      - question: "What is answer synthesis? Should I use it for a Foundry IQ knowledge base?"
        answer: |
            [Answer synthesis](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-answer-synthesis) uses an LLM to generate a complete, natural-language answer based on retrieved content.
            
            For most Foundry IQ scenarios, use extractive data instead of answer synthesis. Extractive data returns raw content that agents can reason over and incorporate into their responses. Reserve answer synthesis for standalone applications where the retrieval output goes directly to users without agent processing.

  - name: "Knowledge bases and knowledge sources"
    questions:
      - question: "What is a knowledge base?"
        answer: |
            A [knowledge base](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base) is an Azure AI Search object that unifies access to one or more knowledge sources. At query time, the knowledge base uses agentic retrieval to select relevant sources, generate and route subqueries, and aggregate the results. When used with an LLM, the retrieval engine can also perform query planning and multi‑turn iteration. All retrieval operations enforce user‑level access controls inherited from the connected sources.

      - question: "What knowledge sources are supported?"
        answer: |
          Azure AI Search supports two types of [knowledge sources](/azure/search/agentic-knowledge-source-overview):
          
          + **Indexed knowledge sources** ingest data into a search index and automatically handle chunking, vectorization, metadata extraction, and access control list (ACL) synchronization.
          + **Remote knowledge sources** don't ingest or store data. Instead, they issue on-demand queries to the external system at retrieval time.

  - name: "Availability"
    questions:
      - question: "What regions support Foundry IQ?"
        answer: |
          Regional availability depends on the retrieval reasoning effort. Minimal and low effort are available in most regions, while effort is available in certain regions.

  - name: "Pricing and billing"
    questions:
      - question: "How is Foundry IQ billed?"
        answer: |
          Foundry IQ doesn't have its own meter. Billing flows through the underlying resources: Azure AI Search (based on pricing tier and agentic retrieval tokens) and Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models (per-token for retrieval reasoning). Costs might also apply to certain knowledge sources.

      - question: "What are agentic retrieval reasoning tokens?"
        answer: |
          Agentic retrieval reasoning tokens are input tokens into the knowledge base retrieval engine. Input tokens come from documents discovered during retrieval from indexed or remote knowledge sources.

      - question: "Is there a free tier?"
        answer: |
          Yes. For proof-of-concept testing, use the free tier for Azure AI Search and the free token allocation for agentic retrieval.

  - name: "Security and governance"
    questions:
      - question: "How does Foundry IQ handle permissions?"
        answer: |
          Foundry IQ enforces document-level ACLs (synced during indexing, trimmed at query time) and runs queries under the user's Microsoft Entra identity. Remote SharePoint sources support out-of-the-box ACL and Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels.

      - question: "What authentication methods are supported?"
        answer: |
          Role-based access control with managed identities (recommended) or API keys. Remote SharePoint knowledge sources require end users to have a valid Copilot license.

  - name: "Related products"
    questions:
      - question: "How does Foundry IQ relate to Fabric IQ and Work IQ?"
        answer: |
          Microsoft provides three IQ workloads for agent-native systems: Fabric IQ for business analytics, Work IQ for Microsoft 365 collaboration, and Foundry IQ for enterprise knowledge. Each IQ workload is standalone, but they can work together.

      - question: "What is the difference between Copilot knowledge sources and Foundry IQ knowledge sources?"
        answer: |
          The concept is the same: connecting agents to enterprise data. However, the supported data sources differ by platform and aren't interoperable. In other words, you can't use Foundry IQ knowledge sources in Copilot, and you can't use Copilot knowledge sources in Foundry IQ.

  - name: "Troubleshooting"
    questions:
      - question: "Why isn't my agent returning results from the knowledge base?"
        answer: |
          Common causes include:
          
          + Missing tool invocation in agent instructions.
          + Permission issues between the agent and knowledge base.
          + Incorrect project connection configuration.
          + Empty or misconfigured knowledge sources.
          
          To isolate the issue, test queries directly against the knowledge base in the Azure portal.

      - question: "How do I debug agentic retrieval queries?"
        answer: |
          Use the Azure portal's knowledge base chat playground, which shows query plans, subqueries, and retrieval steps. Enable diagnostic logging on Azure AI Search for detailed request/response data.
