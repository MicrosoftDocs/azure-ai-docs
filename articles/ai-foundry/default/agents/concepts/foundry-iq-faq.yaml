      - question: "What is Foundry IQ?"
        answer: |
          Foundry IQ is a unified knowledge layer for agents that's designed to improve response quality, automate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows, and enable enterprise-ready grounding.
          
          With Foundry IQ, you create a knowledge base that connects to one or more knowledge sources. An agentic retrieval engine processes queries, and an optional LLM from Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models adds query planning and reasoning. Agents built in Foundry Agent Service or other frameworks call the knowledge base to retrieve relevant content.
      
      - question: "What is the difference between Foundry IQ and agentic retrieval?"
        answer: |
          Foundry IQ consists of knowledge bases, knowledge sources, and native integrations with Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models and Foundry Agent Service. The Microsoft Foundry (new) portal provides a streamlined setup experience, but you can also call knowledge bases from LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, AutoGen, Haystack, or any application that supports the Azure AI Search APIs.

          Agentic retrieval is the multi-query retrieval engine that powers Foundry IQ knowledge bases. For custom solution, you can use agentic retrieval directly via the Azure AI Search APIs.

      - question: "How is Foundry IQ different from existing RAG patterns or Azure OpenAI On Your Data?"
        answer: |
          With Foundry IQ, you point to one knowledge base to access multiple sources, removing the need to connect each agent to each source individually.
          
          The agentic retrieval engine plans which sources to query and performs iterative search if initial results don't meet relevance standards. Indexing and data synchronization are triggered automatically. Iterative search depends on specifying a medium [retrieval reasoning effort](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-set-retrieval-reasoning-effort) in the knowledge base.

  - name: "Components and requirements"
    questions:
      - question: "Is Azure AI Search required for Foundry IQ?"
        answer: |
          Yes. Foundry IQ is built on Azure AI Search's agentic retrieval capabilities. You must create a knowledge base in Azure AI Search to use Foundry IQ.

      - question: "Is Foundry Agent Service required for Foundry IQ?"
        answer: |
          No. You can call the knowledge base directly from LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, AutoGen, Haystack, or any application that supports the Azure AI Search REST APIs or Azure SDKs. However, Foundry Agent Service provides a turnkey agent hosting platform with built-in support for Foundry IQ knowledge bases.

      - question: "Do Foundry IQ and agentic retrieval have a hard dependency on LLMs?"
        answer: |
          LLM usage for query planning is optional. However, without an LLM, agentic retrieval behaves like single-shot RAG: you still get semantic ranking for a query input, but the query input is a single string.
          
          To benefit from parallel processing of multiple subqueries, LLM query planning is required. The agentic retrieval engine only accepts multiple subqueries from an LLM.

  - name: "Agentic retrieval"
    questions:
      - question: "What is agentic retrieval?"
        answer: |
          [Agentic retrieval](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-overview) is a multi-turn retrieval engine for knowledge bases. It selects which knowledge sources to query, routes requests appropriately, and can automatically iterate when initial results are incomplete. 
          
          When configured with an LLM, agentic retrieval also performs query planning and higher-level reasoning to refine the search process. Benchmarks show approximately [36% higher response quality](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-iq-boost-response-relevance-by-36-with-agentic-retrieval/4470720) than traditional single-shot RAG.

      - question: "What is query planning in agentic retrieval?"
        answer: |
          Query planning is the process by which an LLM breaks down a complex query into smaller, more focused subqueries for broader coverage of your search corpus. It also includes the logic for selecting one knowledge source over another.
          
          You can influence knowledge source selection by specifying index descriptions and retrieval instructions in a knowledge base. For example, you might specify "use the employee-handbook-index for questions about time off" and "use the health-insurance-index for questions about medical coverage."

      - question: "How is query planning invoked?"
        answer: |
          Query planning is invoked when you specify the low or medium retrieval reasoning effort in a knowledge base.

      - question: "What is the retrieval reasoning effort?"
        answer: |
            The [retrieval reasoning effort](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-set-retrieval-reasoning-effort) determines how much LLM-driven planning is used during agentic retrieval. Levels range from minimal to medium, influencing how deeply the system interprets the query, selects sources, and decides whether additional retrieval steps are needed. 

      - question: "What is answer synthesis? Should I use it for a Foundry IQ knowledge base?"
        answer: |
            [Answer synthesis](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-answer-synthesis) uses an LLM to generate a complete, natural-language answer based on retrieved content.
            
            For most Foundry IQ scenarios, use extractive data instead of answer synthesis. Extractive data returns raw content that agents can reason over and incorporate into their responses. Reserve answer synthesis for standalone applications where the retrieval output goes directly to users without agent processing.

  - name: "Knowledge bases and knowledge sources"
    questions:
      - question: "What is a knowledge base?"
        answer: |
            A [knowledge base](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base) is a top-level object that unifies access to one or more knowledge sources. At query time, the knowledge base uses agentic retrieval to select relevant sources, generate and route subqueries, and aggregate the results. When used with an LLM, the retrieval engine can also perform query planning and multi-turn iteration. All retrieval operations enforce user‑level access controls inherited from the connected sources.

      - question: "What knowledge sources are supported?"
        answer: |
          There are two types of [knowledge sources](/azure/search/agentic-knowledge-source-overview):
          
          + **Indexed knowledge sources** ingest data into a search index and automatically handle chunking, vectorization, metadata extraction, and access control list (ACL) synchronization.
          + **Remote knowledge sources** don't ingest or store data. Instead, they issue on-demand queries to the external system at retrieval time.

  - name: "Availability and pricing"
    questions:
      - question: "Where is Foundry IQ available? How is it billed?"
        answer: |
          Foundry IQ is subject to the regional availability and billing of its underlying services. For more information, see [Availability and pricing of agentic retrieval](/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-overview#availability-and-pricing).

      - question: "Is there a free tier?"
        answer: |
          Yes. For proof-of-concept testing, use the free tier for Azure AI Search and the free token allocation for agentic retrieval.
  
  - name: "Security and governance"
    questions:
      - question: "How does Foundry IQ handle permissions?"
        answer: |
          Foundry IQ enforces document-level ACLs (synced during indexing, trimmed at query time) and runs queries under the user's Microsoft Entra identity. Remote SharePoint sources support out-of-the-box ACL and Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels.

      - question: "What authentication methods are supported?"
        answer: |
          Role-based access control with managed identities (recommended) or API keys. Remote SharePoint knowledge sources require end users to have a valid Copilot license.

  - name: "Related products"
    questions:
      - question: "How does Foundry IQ relate to Fabric IQ and Work IQ?"
        answer: |
          Microsoft provides three IQ workloads for agent-native systems: Fabric IQ for business analytics, Work IQ for Microsoft 365 collaboration, and Foundry IQ for enterprise knowledge. Each IQ workload is standalone, but they can work together.

      - question: "What is the difference between Copilot knowledge sources and Foundry IQ knowledge sources?"
        answer: |
          The concept is the same: connecting agents to enterprise data. However, the supported data sources differ by platform and aren't interoperable. In other words, you can't use Foundry IQ knowledge sources in Copilot, and you can't use Copilot knowledge sources in Foundry IQ.

  - name: "Troubleshooting"
    questions:
      - question: "Why isn't my agent returning results from my knowledge base?"
        answer: |
          Common causes include:
          
          + Missing tool invocation in agent instructions.
          + Permission issues between the agent and knowledge base.
          + Incorrect project connection configuration.
          + Empty or misconfigured knowledge sources.
          
          To isolate the issue, test queries against your knowledge base in the Azure portal.

      - question: "How do I debug agentic retrieval queries?"
        answer: |
          Use the knowledge base chat playground in the Azure portal, which shows query plans, subqueries, and retrieval steps. [Enable diagnostic logging](/azure/search/search-monitor-enable-logging) for detailed request/response data.
