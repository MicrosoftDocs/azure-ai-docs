Public Tool Catalog is an enterprise-ready curated list for all Foundry developers to discover tools available for you to build AI agents. You can search, filter, or sort to find the right tool for your AI agents.  

Filter 

Filter: by type 

There are 3 types of tools in the public tool catalog: remote MCP server, local MCP server that require Foundry developers to self-host and custom MCP server that require Foundry developer’s additional configuration to convert to a remote MCP server.  

Type 

Explanation  

Remote MCP Server 

The MCP server publisher has already hosted the server and provided a static or dynamic MCP server endpoint. Foundry developers need to follow the configuration guidance to provide the appropriate information to finish the set up. 

Local MCP Server 

The MCP server publisher doesn’t host the server and require Foundry developers to self-host and bring the self-hosted remote MCP server endpoint back to Foundry to use it with AI agents. Learn more about self-hosting a local MCP server here: https://aka.ms/FoundryCustomMCP  

Custom MCP Server 

These MCP servers are converted from Azure Logic App Connectors. Foundry developers need additional configuration to convert to remote MCP servers. Learn more about how to configure custom MCP servers here: https://aka.ms/FoundryCustomTool
