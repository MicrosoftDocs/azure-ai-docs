# Quickstart: Get answers in the chat playground

Learn how to get answers using the chat playground in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs). Deploy (or reuse) a chat model and send prompts to receive AI-generated responses.

In this quickstart, you learn how to:
- Configure a system message.
- Send a user question.
- Interpret the model response.
- Add safety system messages.

For this quickstart, you can use either a [!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)] or a [!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]. For more information about the differences between these two project types, see [Project types](../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#project-types).

## Get answers in the playground

Use the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) playground to get answers from AI models. In this quickstart, you'll learn how to ask questions and get responses from deployed chat models.

To get answers from your deployed model in the chat playground:

1. In the **System message** text box, provide this prompt to guide the assistant: "You're an AI assistant that helps people find information." You can tailor the prompt for your scenario.
1. Optionally, add a safety system message by selecting the **Add section** button, then **Safety system messages**. Choose from the prebuilt messages, and then edit them to your needs.

1. Select **Apply changes** to save your changes, and when prompted to see if you want to update the system message, select **Continue**. 
1. In the chat session pane, enter the following question: "How much do the TrailWalker hiking shoes cost?"
1. Select the right arrow icon to send.

1. The assistant either replies that it doesn't know the answer or provides a generic response (for example, noting price variability). The model doesn't have access to current product data yet.

Next, add your data so the model can answer domain-specific questions. Try the enterprise chat web app tutorial.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No deployed models listed | Deploy a model from the model catalog first |
| Repeated generic answers | Refine system message or add domain data |
| Safety message overrides tone | Adjust or remove conflicting safety sections |
| Slow first response | Allow for cold start; subsequent prompts are faster |

## Next steps

- Build a custom chat app with the SDK.
- Add evaluations to measure response quality.
- Fine-tune a model for improved intent handling.
