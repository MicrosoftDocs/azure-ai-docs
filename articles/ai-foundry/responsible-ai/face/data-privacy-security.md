# Data and privacy for Face

[!INCLUDE [non-english-translation](../includes/non-english-translation.md)]

This article provides some high level details regarding how Face processes data provided by customers. Face was designed with compliance, privacy, and security in mind. Biometric identification technologies are intended to process personal data that may be considered sensitive personal information.  Please be aware that the laws governing biometric recognition technologies often vary internationally and domestically, including at the federal, state and local levels.  In addition to regulating allowed use cases, some  jurisdictions impose special legal requirements for the permissions governing collection, transfer, online processing, and storage of biometric data, particularly when used for identification or verification. Before using Face and our Azure services for the collection, transfer, processing and storage of any data subject’s biometric data, you must ensure compliance with the relevant legal requirements that apply to your service application.

* Inform people in your locations with conspicuous disclosure about use of image data and use of facial recognition.
* Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For our customer’s convenience, please consider utilizing the following disclosure regarding Microsoft's role when you use of Azure AI services Face with your end users:
[Company] uses Microsoft face recognition technology to process [Company’s] users’ biometric data as its service provider (“Processor”).  Microsoft may process and store face templates for the purposes of providing face verification and/or identification services on [Company]’s behalf, and only as instructed by [Company].  Microsoft will store this data as long as [Company] requests, which shall be no longer than a limited grace period after the date when (i) [Company] ceases to have a relationship with Microsoft or (ii) when [Company] requests deletion.


## What data does Face process, how long is it retained and what protections are in place?


Descriptions of Face API processes use the key terms defined [here](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/face/transparency-note#key-terms).

Face maintains GDPR data processor classification across all supported regions. 

| Face API operation | Feature | Input data | Output  | Retention of face template | Customer controls for data retention|
|------|-------|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| **[Face Detection without faceID](/rest/api/face/face-detection-operations/detect)**| Detects faces within images<br><br>Includes the following parameters:<ul><li>returnFaceLandmarks</li><li>returnFaceAttributes</li><li>detectionModel</li></ul> **Scenario**: Face detection | Image (binary or URL download)| Coordinates of the bounding box location(s) of the face(s) are generalized regardless of who is in the image. Cannot be used to recognize faces or otherwise uniquely identify individuals. | No template is created | N/A |
| **[Face Detection with faceID](/rest/api/face/face-detection-operations/detect)** | Returns a face ID to be used for the [Face recognition APIs](/rest/api/face/face-recognition-operations) (Identify,  Verify API, Group API, and Find Similar).<br><br>Face ID is only supported for customers who have been approved for access.<br><br>Includes the following parameters:<ul><li>returnFaceId=true</li><li>recognitionModel</li><li>returnRecognitionModel</li><li>*faceIdTimeToLive*</li></ul>**Scenario**: Facial Verification and Facial Identification (approved customers only) | Image (binary or URL download) | FaceID, a randomly generated identifier assigned to a new face feature template for each image submitted to Face API.

> No images sent to the Face service are stored after analysis. Microsoft does not use input or output data to train, retrain, or improve the Face API.

## How does the Face process data? 

The diagram below illustrates how your data is processed for Face Detection with Face ID (approved customers only).

## Security for customers’ data

The security of customer data is a shared responsibility.

The following are a few best practices for further securing Azure AI services Face: 
* **Customer managed encryption keys** [are available.](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/identity-encrypt-data-at-rest)
* [**Azure AI services Face supports VNET**](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-virtual-networks?tabs=portal) to restrict access to certain IP addresses, IP ranges, or a list of subnets.
* **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication** allows you to authenticate to Azure AI services using Azure AD. This capability provides greater flexibility for managing access to Azure AI services and makes it easier to use existing policies for credential rotation and to enforce custom password standards.
   - You can also further protect access to sensitive facial feature templates by using [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](/azure/ai-services/authentication?tabs=powershell#authenticate-with-azure-active-directory) to use the *Cognitive Services Face Recognizer* role that restricts access to detect, verify, identify, group, and find similar operations on Face. This role does not allow create or delete enroll operations, which makes it well suited for endpoints that only need inferencing capabilities, following “least privilege” best practices.
