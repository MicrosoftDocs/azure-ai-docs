# Research Insights for Azure AI Vision spatial analysis

[!INCLUDE [non-english-translation](../includes/non-english-translation.md)]

This section summarizes research insights which apply to applications of AI systems that gather data from the environment to generate insights about how people behave. All sources for the references made in this article are listed in the [references section](#references).

## Research insights

**AI systems need to be designed to support effective human decision-making.**
AI systems are probabilistic in nature and can be computationally complex. In order to make it easier for users to be aware of system errors and other unintended outcomes and thereby support effective human decision-making(15), it is critical that these systems provide explanations about how the system works and be designed with the right level of human control.(16,17) The right level of human involvement needs to be evaluated on a per scenario/ context-of-use basis.(18,19)

**People prefer having the option to opt-in/out.**
In scenarios where technology is being used to monitor individuals' presence and behavior, many people expect to have the option to decide if they will participate.(4,20) Furthermore, some also expect that they would not be automatically enrolled into these scenarios. Some people will take actions to avoid interaction with technology when it is viewed as undesirable (i.e., having low perceptions on benefits).(21)

**Space Analysis metrics require clear explanations about what is NOT being recorded.**
People can have difficulty understanding how novel technology such as Space Analysis technology works. In the presence of monitoring technology, people's default position is that their personal data is being recorded.(20)

**People want to know what data is being processed and/or stored/recorded, how it is being used, and how it is secured.**
People care a lot about the data that systems collect about them.(4,8,21) Many people desire to understand the details of how data is used and secured. Furthermore, there is a need to know who would have access to the data, and what controls are in place to allow deletion of personal data, if applicable.(4,20,22,23)

**Concerns with workplace employee monitoring**
Recent external research shows that many people care about what organizations and employers are doing to ensure public safety with respect to COVID-19.(1,2,3) However, there is also research that shows people have less trust when the technology is used in a workplace environment for monitoring purposes. Across multiple studies, people have indicated discomfort in being monitored in the workplace.(4,5,6,7,8) The recommendations in this report consider the tension.

**Some workplace locations are expected to be more private.**
Research on space analysis technology indicates that the presence of space monitoring cameras is less welcome in personal workspaces, meeting spaces, conference rooms, and hallways (where people commonly have impromptu conversations).(4) Additionally, it is expected that restrooms should remain completely private and there may be additional legal considerations.

**Risk-benefit comparison**
For COVID-19 scenarios, the benefits of public health and safety need to be communicated.(2,3) Public polling shows that many are willing to make economic sacrifices in order to save lives(9), and place high importance on having safety conditions met before returning to normal activities.(10) However, trust in surveillance technology depends on perceived benefits. For example, there is generally trust in the use of surveillance technologies for building access as there is a clear perceived benefit (e.g. security & efficiency).(5)

**Trust in technology varies across demographic groups**
Careful considerations for marginalized groups should be taken when deploying technology. Some demographic groups have less trust in technology based on societal inequities and cultural norms.(5) For example, systematically marginalized groups often alter their behavior out of fear or intimidation when under surveillance (e.g., women, ethnic minorities, introverts).(13,14)

**People need time to weigh perceived benefits against perceived harms.**
In general, people do a cost-benefit analysis based on their perceptions of how a technology may impact them, but they are rarely capable of performing this analysis in the moment (especially if they are being observed).(5) In many scenarios this analysis can be
polarizing, where the perceived outcome is either primarily harmful or primarily beneficial. It is less common that both harms and benefits are perceived in equal magnitude. As a result, if benefits aren't clearly described and demonstrated, and if concerns and harms aren't proactively addressed, adoption may be put at risk because of the polarizing nature of this cost-benefit analysis.(23,24,25)

**Trust in surveillance technology increases when promoting efficiency, security, and safety.**
Public perceptions of surveillance technology become more favorable, and contribute to building trust, when there are clearly demonstrated benefits around efficiency, security, and safety.(5) Distrust in technology increases with perceptions of system
inaccuracies and the potential harmful consequences of errors. Additionally, people distrust technology when is perceived to infringe
on civil liberties. The public does not fully understand the nuance of identifiable monitoring systems, and de-identified systems.

**People tend to have greater trust in surveillance technology when used by official government agencies versus commercial entities.**
The public, generally, has more trust in in surveillance technology when it is used by official government agencies (e.g., law enforcement, airport security), compared to in the use of the technology by private and commercial organizations, due to concerns about data misuse.(5,6,7) Ongoing events with personal data hacks and misuse by corporations have contributed to this negative  perception.(26,27)
