# Limited Access features of Azure AI Vision

[!INCLUDE [non-english-translation](../includes/non-english-translation.md)]

Our vision is to empower developers and organizations to leverage AI to transform society in positive ways. We encourage responsible AI practices to protect the rights and safety of individuals. Microsoft facial recognition services are Limited Access in order to help prevent the misuse of the services in accordance with our [AI Principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?SilentAuth=1&wa=wsignin1.0) and [facial recognition principles](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/17/six-principles-to-guide-microsofts-facial-recognition-work/). The Celebrity Recognition API in Azure AI Vision is a Limited Access feature that requires registration.  

## Registration process

Access to the Celebrity Recognition API is only available to customers managed by Microsoft, defined as those working directly with a Microsoft account team, and only for use cases selected at the time of registration. Other Azure AI Vision features do not require registration to use.

Customers who wish to use the Celebrity Recognition API are required to [submit a registration form](https://aka.ms/facerecognition). Access is subject to Microsoft's sole discretion based on eligibility criteria and a vetting process. Microsoft may require customers to reverify this information periodically.

The Azure AI Vision service is made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services (including the [Service Specific Terms](https://aka.ms/MCAServiceSpecificTerms)). Please review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations governing your use of Azure AI Vision.

Learn more about the legal terms that apply to this service [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/).
