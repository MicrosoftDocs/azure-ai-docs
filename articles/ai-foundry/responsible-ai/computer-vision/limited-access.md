# Limited Access features of Azure Vision in Foundry Tools

[!INCLUDE [non-english-translation](../includes/non-english-translation.md)]

To help prevent misuse in accordance with Microsoft’s [AI Principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?SilentAuth=1&wa=wsignin1.0) and [facial recognition principles](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/17/six-principles-to-guide-microsofts-facial-recognition-work/), facial recognition features—including the Celebrity Recognition API in Azure Vision in Foundry Tools—are Limited Access and require registration.
<!-- Condensed the marketing-oriented introduction into a single policy-scoped sentence focused on Limited Access and responsible AI principles, per agent feedback. -->

## Registration process

Access to the Celebrity Recognition API is only available to customers managed by Microsoft, defined as those working directly with a Microsoft account team, and only for use cases selected at the time of registration. Other Vision features do not require registration to use.

Customers who wish to use the Celebrity Recognition API are required to [submit a registration form](https://aka.ms/facerecognition). Access is subject to Microsoft's sole discretion based on eligibility criteria and a vetting process. Microsoft may require customers to reverify this information periodically.

The Vision service is made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services (including the [Service Specific Terms](https://aka.ms/MCAServiceSpecificTerms)). Please review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations governing your use of Vision.

Learn more about the legal terms that apply to this service [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/).
