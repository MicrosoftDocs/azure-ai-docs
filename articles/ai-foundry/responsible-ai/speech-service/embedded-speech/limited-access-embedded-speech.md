# Limited Access to embedded Speech

[!INCLUDE [non-english-translation](../../includes/non-english-translation.md)]

Embedded Speech is designed for on-device speech to text and text to speech scenarios where cloud connectivity is intermittent or unavailable. Microsoft's embedded Speech feature is a Limited Access feature available by registration only, and only for certain use cases.

## Registration process

As a Limited Access feature, embedded Speech requires registration. Only customers managed by Microsoft, meaning those who are working directly with Microsoft account teams, are eligible for access. Customers who wish to use this feature are required to register by [submitting a registration form](https://aka.ms/csgate-embedded-speech). The use of embedded Speech is limited to the use case selected at the time of registration. Microsoft may require customers to re-verify this information.

The embedded Speech is made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services (including the [Service Specific Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2018760)). Please review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations governing your use of embedded Speech.
