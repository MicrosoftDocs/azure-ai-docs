# Limited Access to Speaker Recognition

As part of Microsoft's commitment to responsible AI, Speaker Recognition is designed with the intention of protecting the rights of individuals and society and fostering transparent human-computer interaction. For this reason, Microsoft's Speaker Recognition feature is a Limited Access feature available by registration only, and only for certain use cases.

## Registration process

As a Limited Access feature, Speaker Recognition requires registration. We have paused all new registrations for the Speaker Recognition Limited Access program at this time.
