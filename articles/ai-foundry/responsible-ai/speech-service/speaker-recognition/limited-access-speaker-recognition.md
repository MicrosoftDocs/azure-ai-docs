# Limited Access to Speaker Recognition

[!INCLUDE [non-english-translation](../../includes/non-english-translation.md)]

As part of Microsoft's commitment to responsible AI, Speaker Recognition is designed with the intention of protecting the rights of individuals and society and fostering transparent human-computer interaction. For this reason, Microsoft's Speaker Recognition feature is a Limited Access feature available by registration only, and only for certain use cases.

## Registration process

As a Limited Access feature, Speaker Recognition requires registration. We have paused all new registrations for the Speaker Recognition Limited Access program at this time.
