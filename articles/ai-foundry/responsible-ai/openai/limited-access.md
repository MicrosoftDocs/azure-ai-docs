# Limited access for Azure Direct Models

[!INCLUDE [non-english-translation](../includes/non-english-translation.md)]

As part of Microsoft's commitment to responsible AI, we have designed and operate Azure Direct Models (as defined in the [Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/welcome/welcomepage)) with the intention of respecting the rights of individuals and society and fostering transparent human-computer interaction. For this reason, certain Azure Direct Models (or versions of them) are designated as Limited Access Services, and access and use are subject to eligibility criteria determined by Microsoft. Unless otherwise indicated in the service, all Azure customers are eligible for access to Azure Direct Models, and all uses consistent with the Product Terms and Code of Conduct are permitted, so customers are not required to submit a registration form unless they are: (a) accessing an Azure Direct Model designated as a Limited Access Service, or (b) requesting approval to modify Guardrails (previously content filters) and/or abuse monitoring for an Azure Direct Model. 

Azure Direct Models are made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services, including [Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/welcome/welcomepage) such as the Universal License Terms applicable to Microsoft Generative AI Services and the product offering terms for the Azure Direct Model. Please review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations governing your use. 

Azure OpenAI Service is made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services, including such as the Universal License Terms applicable to Microsoft Generative AI Services and the product offering terms for Azure OpenAI. Please review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations governing your use of Azure OpenAI Service.

## Registration for modified Guardrails and/or abuse monitoring 

All customers have the ability to configure severity thresholds on Guardrails (previously content filters), however, the modified Guardrails approval process is required to turn the Guardrails partially or fully off. Customers who wish to modify Guardrails and/or modify abuse monitoring are subject to additional eligibility criteria and requirements. At this time, modified Guardrails (previously content filters) and/or modified abuse monitoring for Azure Direct Models are available only to customers and partners managed by a Microsoft account team or under an eligible program, and are subject to additional requirements. Customers meeting these requirements can request approval for modified Guardrails and/or modified abuse monitoring using the following forms:
