# Data, privacy, and security for Azure AI Language

[!INCLUDE [non-english-translation](../includes/non-english-translation.md)]

This article provides details regarding how Azure AI Language processes your data. Azure AI Language is designed with compliance, privacy, and security in mind. However, you are responsible for its use and the implementation of this technology. It's your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.
 

## What data does Azure AI Language process and how does it process it?

* Azure AI Language processes text data that is sent by the customer to the system for the purposes of getting a response from one of the available features.
* All results of the requested feature are sent back to the customer in the API response as specified in the API reference. For example, if Language Detection is requested, the language code is returned along with a confidence score for each text record.
* Azure AI Language uses aggregate telemetry such as which APIs are used and the number of calls from each subscription and resource for service monitoring purposes.
* Azure AI Language doesn't store or process customer data outside the region where the customer deploys the service instance.
* Azure AI Language encrypts all content, including customer data, at rest.


## How is data retained and what customer controls are available?

* Data sent in synchronous or asynchronous calls may be temporarily stored by Azure AI Language for up to 48 hours only and is purged thereafter. This data is encrypted and is only accessible to authorized on call engineers when service support is needed for debugging purposes in the event of a catastrophic failure. To prevent this temporary storage of input data, the LoggingOptOut query parameter can be set accordingly. By default, this parameter is set to false for Language Detection, Key Phrase Extraction, Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition endpoints. The LoggingOptOut parameter is true by default for the PII and health feature endpoints. More information on the LoggingOptOut query parameter is available in the API reference.
