# Serverless API inference examples for Foundry Models

The Azure AI model catalog offers a large selection of Azure AI Foundry Models from a wide range of providers. You have various options for deploying models from the model catalog. This article lists inference examples for serverless API deployments.

[!INCLUDE [models-preview](../includes/models-preview.md)]

To perform inferencing with the models, some models such as [Nixtla's TimeGEN-1](#nixtla) and [Cohere rerank](#cohere-rerank) require you to use custom APIs from the model providers. Others support inferencing using the [Model Inference API](../model-inference/overview.md). You can find more details about individual models by reviewing their model cards in the [model catalog for Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models).


## Cohere

The Cohere family of models includes various models optimized for different use cases, including rerank, chat completions, and embeddings models.

### Cohere rerank

To perform inferencing with Cohere rerank models, you're required to use Cohere's custom rerank APIs. For more information on the Cohere rerank model and its capabilities, see [Cohere rerank](../foundry-models/concepts/models.md#cohere-rerank).


#### Pricing for Cohere rerank models

*Queries*, not to be confused with a user's query, is a pricing meter that refers to the cost associated with the tokens used as input for inference of a Cohere Rerank model. Cohere counts a single search unit as a query with up to 100 documents to be ranked. Documents longer than 500 tokens (for Cohere-rerank-v3.5) or longer than 4096 tokens (for Cohere-rerank-v3-English and Cohere-rerank-v3-multilingual) when including the length of the search query are split up into multiple chunks, where each chunk counts as a single document.

See the [Cohere model collection in Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models?&selectedCollection=cohere).

## Nixtla

Nixtla's TimeGEN-1 is a generative pre-trained forecasting and anomaly detection model for time series data. TimeGEN-1 can produce accurate forecasts for new time series without training, using only historical values and exogenous covariates as inputs.

To perform inferencing, TimeGEN-1 requires you to use Nixtla's custom inference API.  For more information on the TimeGEN-1 model and its capabilities, see [Nixtla](../foundry-models/concepts/models.md#nixtla).

#### Estimate the number of tokens needed

Before you create a TimeGEN-1 deployment, it's useful to estimate the number of tokens that you plan to consume and be billed for.
One token corresponds to one data point in your input dataset or output dataset.

Suppose you have the following input time series dataset:

| Unique_id | Timestamp           | Target Variable | Exogenous Variable 1 | Exogenous Variable 2 |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| BE        | 2016-10-22 00:00:00 | 70.00           | 49593.0              | 57253.0              |
| BE        | 2016-10-22 01:00:00 | 37.10           | 46073.0              | 51887.0              |

To determine the number of tokens, multiply the number of rows (in this example, two) and the number of columns used for forecasting—not counting the unique_id and timestamp columns (in this example, three) to get a total of six tokens.

Given the following output dataset:

| Unique_id | Timestamp           | Forecasted Target Variable |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| BE        | 2016-10-22 02:00:00 | 46.57                      |
| BE        | 2016-10-22 03:00:00 | 48.57                      |

You can also determine the number of tokens by counting the number of data points returned after data forecasting. In this example, the number of tokens is two.

#### Estimate pricing based on tokens

There are four pricing meters that determine the price you pay. These meters are as follows:

| Pricing Meter | Description |
| -- | -- |
| paygo-inference-input-tokens | Costs associated with the tokens used as input for inference when *finetune_steps* = 0 |
| paygo-inference-output-tokens | Costs associated with the tokens used as output for inference when *finetune_steps* = 0 |
| paygo-finetuned-model-inference-input-tokens | Costs associated with the tokens used as input for inference when *finetune_steps* > 0 |
| paygo-finetuned-model-inference-output-tokens | Costs associated with the tokens used as output for inference when *finetune_steps* > 0 |

See the [Nixtla model collection in Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models?&selectedCollection=nixtla).

## Gretel Navigator

Gretel Navigator employs a compound AI architecture specifically engineered for synthetic data, by combining top open-source small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned across more than 10 industry domains. This purpose-built system creates diverse, domain-specific datasets at scales of hundreds to millions of examples. The system also preserves complex statistical relationships and offers increased speed and accuracy compared to manual data creation.
