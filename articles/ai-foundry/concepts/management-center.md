# Management center overview

The management center is a part of the Azure AI Foundry portal that streamlines governance and management activities. From the management center, you can manage:

- Azure AI Foundry hubs and [!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)]s
- Azure AI [!INCLUDE [FDP](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]s
- Quotas for models and virtual machines (VMs)

    > [!NOTE]
    > VM quotas are only available for [!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)]s.

- User management and role assignment

To access the management center, sign in to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs), select a project, and then select **Management center** from the bottom of left menu.

## Manage Foundry projects

Use the management center to create and configure [!INCLUDE [FDP](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]s. Use __All resources__ to view all [!INCLUDE [FDP](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]s that you have access to, or to create new projects. Use the __Project__ section of the left menu to manage individual [!INCLUDE [FDP](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)].

For more information, see [Create a [!INCLUDE [fdp-project-name](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]](../how-to/create-projects.md?pivots=fdp-project)


### Manage Azure AI Foundry hubs and hub based projects

You can also manage [!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)]s from the management center. They're listed in the __All resources__ section, and when selected are displayed in the left menu.

For more information, see [Create a [!INCLUDE [hub-project-name](../includes/hub-project-name.md)]](../how-to/create-projects.md?pivots=hub-project).

## Manage resource utilization

View and manage quotas and usage metrics across multiple projects and Azure subscriptions. Use the __Quota__ link from the left menu to view and manage quotas.

## Govern access

With a project selected, you can use the __Users__ entry in the left menu to view and manage users and their roles.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign built-in roles for Azure AI Foundry in the management center.
