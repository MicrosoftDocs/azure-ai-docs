# Synthetic data generation in Microsoft Foundry portal

[!INCLUDE [classic-banner](../includes/classic-banner.md)]

In Microsoft Foundry portal, you can use synthetic data generation to efficiently produce predictions for your datasets. This article introduces you to the concept of synthetic data generation and how you can use it in machine learning.

## What is synthetic data generation?

Synthetic data generation involves creating artificial data that mimics the statistical properties of real-world data. This data is generated through algorithms and machine learning techniques. You can use the data in various ways, such as computer simulations or modeling real-world events.

## Benefits

In machine learning, synthetic data is valuable for:

- **Data augmentation**: It helps in expanding the size of training datasets, which is crucial for training robust machine learning models. This expansion technique is especially useful when real-world data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

- **Testing and validation**: It allows for extensive testing and validation of machine learning models under various scenarios without the need for real-world data.

## Sample notebook

To see how to generate synthetic data, you can use the [sample notebook](https://aka.ms/meta-llama-3.1-datagen).
