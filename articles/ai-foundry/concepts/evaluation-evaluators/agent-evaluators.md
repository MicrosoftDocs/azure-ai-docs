# Agent evaluators (preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview.md)]

Agents are powerful productivity assistants. They can plan, make decisions, and execute actions. Agents typically first [reason through user intents in conversations](#intent-resolution), [select the correct tools](#tool-call-accuracy) to call and satisfy the user requests, and [complete various tasks](#task-adherence) according to their instructions. We currently support these agent-specific evaluators for agentic workflows:

- [Intent resolution](#intent-resolution)
- [Tool call accuracy](#tool-call-accuracy)
- [Task adherence](#task-adherence)

## Evaluating Azure AI agents

Agents emit messages, and providing the above inputs typically require parsing messages and extracting the relevant information. If you're building agents using Azure AI Agent Service, we provide native integration for evaluation that directly takes their agent messages. To learn more, see an [end-to-end example of evaluating agents in Azure AI Agent Service](https://aka.ms/e2e-agent-eval-sample).

Besides `IntentResolution`, `ToolCallAccuracy`, `TaskAdherence` specific to agentic workflows, you can also assess other quality and safety aspects of your agentic workflows, using our comprehensive suite of built-in evaluators. We support this list of evaluators for Azure AI agent messages from our converter:

- **Quality**: `IntentResolution`, `ToolCallAccuracy`, `TaskAdherence`, `Relevance`, `Coherence`, `Fluency`
- **Safety**: `CodeVulnerabilities`, `Violence`, `Self-harm`, `Sexual`, `HateUnfairness`, `IndirectAttack`, `ProtectedMaterials`.

In this article we show examples of `IntentResolution`, `ToolCallAccuracy`, and `TaskAdherence`. For examples of using other evaluators with Azure AI agent messages, see [evaluating Azure AI agents](../../how-to/develop/agent-evaluate-sdk.md#evaluate-azure-ai-agents).

## Model configuration for AI-assisted evaluators

For reference in the following code snippets, the AI-assisted evaluators use a model configuration for the LLM-judge:

```python
import os
from azure.ai.evaluation import AzureOpenAIModelConfiguration
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

model_config = AzureOpenAIModelConfiguration(
    azure_endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_ENDPOINT"],
    api_key=os.environ.get("AZURE_API_KEY"),
    azure_deployment=os.environ.get("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    api_version=os.environ.get("AZURE_API_VERSION"),
)
```

### Evaluator model support

We support AzureOpenAI or OpenAI [reasoning models](../../../ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning.md) and non-reasoning models for the LLM-judge depending on the evaluators:

| Evaluators | Reasoning Models as Judge (example: o-series models from Azure OpenAI / OpenAI) | Non-reasoning models as Judge (example: gpt-4.1, gpt-4o, etc.) | To enable |
|--|--|--|--|
| `Intent Resolution`, `Task Adherence`, `Tool Call Accuracy`, `Response Completeness` | Supported | Supported | Set additional parameter `is_reasoning_model=True` in initializing evaluators |
| Other quality evaluators| Not Supported | Supported | -- |

For complex evaluation that requires refined reasoning, we recommend a strong reasoning model like `o3-mini` and o-series mini models released afterwards with a balance of reasoning performance and cost efficiency.

## Intent resolution

`IntentResolutionEvaluator` measures how well the system identifies and understands a user's request, including how well it scopes the user’s intent, asks clarifying questions, and reminds end users of its scope of capabilities. Higher score means better identification of user intent.

### Intent resolution example

```python
from azure.ai.evaluation import IntentResolutionEvaluator

intent_resolution = IntentResolutionEvaluator(model_config=model_config, threshold=3)
intent_resolution(
    query="What are the opening hours of the Eiffel Tower?",
    response="Opening hours of the Eiffel Tower are 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM."
)

```

### Intent resolution output

The numerical score is on a Likert scale (integer 1 to 5) and a higher score is better. Given a numerical threshold (default to 3), we also output "pass" if the score >= threshold, or "fail" otherwise. Using the reason and additional fields can help you understand why the score is high or low.

```python
{
    "intent_resolution": 5.0,
    "intent_resolution_result": "pass",
    "intent_resolution_threshold": 3,
    "intent_resolution_reason": "The response provides the opening hours of the Eiffel Tower clearly and accurately, directly addressing the user's query. It includes specific times, which fully resolves the user's request for information about the opening hours.",
    "additional_details": {
        "conversation_has_intent": True,
        "agent_perceived_intent": "inquire about opening hours",
        "actual_user_intent": "find out the opening hours of the Eiffel Tower",
        "correct_intent_detected": True,
        "intent_resolved": True
    }
}



```

If you're building agents outside of Azure AI Agent Service, this evaluator accepts a schema typical for agent messages. To learn more, see our sample notebook for [Intent Resolution](https://aka.ms/intentresolution-sample).

## Tool call accuracy

`ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator` measures the accuracy and efficiency of tool calls made by an agent in a run. It provides a 1-5 score based on: 
- the relevance and helpfulness of the tool invoked;
- the correctness of parameters used in tool calls;
- the counts of missing or excessive calls.

> [!NOTE]
> `ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator` only supports Azure AI Agent's Function Tool evaluation, but doesn't support Built-in Tool evaluation. The agent run must have at least one Function Tool call and no Built-in Tool calls made to be evaluated.

### Tool call accuracy example

```python
from azure.ai.evaluation import ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator

tool_call_accuracy = ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator(model_config=model_config, threshold=3)
tool_call_accuracy(
    query="How is the weather in Seattle?",
    tool_calls=[{
                    "type": "tool_call",
                    "tool_call_id": "call_CUdbkBfvVBla2YP3p24uhElJ",
                    "name": "fetch_weather",
                    "arguments": {
                        "location": "Seattle"
                    }
                }],
    tool_definitions=[{
                    "id": "fetch_weather",
                    "name": "fetch_weather",
                    "description": "Fetches the weather information for the specified location.",
                    "parameters": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "location": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The location to fetch weather for."
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
    ]
)

```

### Tool call accuracy output

The numerical score is on a Likert scale (integer 1 to 5) and a higher score is better. Given a numerical threshold (default to 3), we also output "pass" if the score >= threshold, or "fail" otherwise. Using the reason and tool call detail fields can help you understand why the score is high or low.

```python
{
    "tool_call_accuracy": 5,
    "tool_call_accuracy_result": "pass",
    "tool_call_accuracy_threshold": 3,
    "details": {
        "tool_calls_made_by_agent": 1,
        "correct_tool_calls_made_by_agent": 1,
        "per_tool_call_details": [
            {
                "tool_name": "fetch_weather",
                "total_calls_required": 1,
                "correct_calls_made_by_agent": 1,
                "correct_tool_percentage": 1.0,
                "tool_call_errors": 0,
                "tool_success_result": "pass"
            }
        ],
        "excess_tool_calls": {
            "total": 0,
            "details": []
        },
        "missing_tool_calls": {
            "total": 0,
            "details": []
        }
    }
}
```

If you're building agents outside of Azure AI Agent Service, this evaluator accepts a schema typical for agent messages. To learn more, see, our sample notebook for [Tool Call Accuracy](https://aka.ms/toolcallaccuracy-sample).

## Task adherence

In various task-oriented AI systems such as agentic systems, it's important to assess whether the agent has stayed on track to complete a given task instead of making inefficient or out-of-scope steps. `TaskAdherenceEvaluator` measures how well an agent’s response adheres to their assigned tasks, according to their task instruction (extracted from system message and user query), and available tools. Higher score means better adherence of the system instruction to resolve the given task.

### Task adherence example

```python
from azure.ai.evaluation import TaskAdherenceEvaluator

task_adherence = TaskAdherenceEvaluator(model_config=model_config, threshold=3)
task_adherence(
        query="What are the best practices for maintaining a healthy rose garden during the summer?",
        response="Make sure to water your roses regularly and trim them occasionally."                         
)
```

### Task adherence output

The numerical score is on a Likert scale (integer 1 to 5) and a higher score is better. Given a numerical threshold (default to 3), we also output "pass" if the score >= threshold, or "fail" otherwise. Using the reason field can help you understand why the score is high or low.

```python
{
   "task_adherence": 2.0,
    "task_adherence_result": "fail",
    "task_adherence_threshold": 3,
    "task_adherence_reason": "The response partially addresses the query by mentioning relevant practices but lacks critical details and depth, making it insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of maintaining a rose garden in summer."
}
```

If you're building agents outside of Azure AI Agent Service, this evaluator accepts a schema typical for agent messages. To learn more, see our sample notebook for [Task Adherence](https://aka.ms/taskadherence-sample).
