# Azure OpenAI Graders (preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview.md)]

The Azure OpenAI Graders are a new set of evaluation graders available in the Azure AI Foundry SDK, aimed at evaluating the performance of AI models and their outputs. These graders including  [Label grader](#label-grader), [String checker](#string-checker), [Text similarity](#text-similarity), and [General grader](#general-grader) can be run locally or remotely. Each grader serves a specific purpose in assessing different aspects of AI model/model outputs.

## Model configuration for AI-assisted grader

For reference in the following code snippet, the AI-assisted grader uses a model configuration as follows:

```python
import os
from azure.ai.evaluation import AzureOpenAIModelConfiguration
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

model_config = AzureOpenAIModelConfiguration(
    azure_endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_ENDPOINT"],
    api_key=os.environ.get["AZURE_API_KEY"],
    azure_deployment=os.environ.get("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    api_version=os.environ.get("AZURE_API_VERSION"),
)
```

## Label grader

`AzureOpenAILabelGrader` uses your custom prompt to instruct a model to classify outputs based on labels you define. It returns structured results with explanations for why each label was chosen.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using Azure OpenAI GPT o3-mini for best results.

Here's an example `data.jsonl` that is used in the following code snippets:

```json
[
    {
        "query": "What is the importance of choosing the right provider in getting the most value out of your health insurance plan?",
        "ground_truth": "Choosing an in-network provider helps you save money and ensures better, more personalized care. [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details-3.pdf]",
        "response": "Choosing the right provider is key to maximizing your health insurance benefits. In-network providers reduce costs, offer better coverage, and support continuity of care, leading to more effective and personalized treatment. [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf][Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf]"
    },
    {
        "query": "What should you do when choosing an in-network provider for your health care needs?",
        "ground_truth": "Check with Northwind Health Plus to confirm the provider is in-network, as this helps reduce costs.\n[Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details-3.pdf]",
        "response": "To choose an in-network provider, confirm they are part of your plan using the Northwind website or by calling their office. Also consider location, availability, and office hours. [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf]"
    },
    {
        "query": "What range of in-network providers does Northwind Health Plus offer?",
        "ground_truth": "Northwind Health Plus offers a wide range of in-network providers, including doctors, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.\n[Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details-3.pdf]",
        "response": "Northwind Health Plus offers a wide range of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf]. The exact range of in-network providers may vary depending on the area, but the Northwind Health Plus website provides a searchable directory of all in-network providers in your area [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf]. It is important to check with Northwind Health Plus to ensure that the provider you are considering is in-network [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf]."
    },
    {
        "query": "What is the limitation of in-network providers?",
        "ground_truth": "The limitation of in-network providers is that they may not always be available in every area.\n[Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details-3.pdf]",
        "response": "The limitation of in-network providers is that they may not accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, which means you may be responsible for a greater portion of the cost [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf]. Additionally, out-of-network providers may not offer additional services or discounts that are available to in-network providers [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf]. It is recommended to choose an in-network provider whenever possible to ensure the best value for your health care expenses [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf].\n\nSources:\n- Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf"
    },
    {
        "query": "What resource does Northwind Health Plus provide to find in-network providers in your area?",
        "ground_truth": "The Northwind Health Plus website offers a searchable directory of all in-network providers in your area. This directory is regularly updated, so you can be sure that you are choosing from in-network providers that are available.\n[Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details-3.pdf]",
        "response": "Northwind Health Plus provides a variety of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf]."
    }
]
```

### Label grader example

```python
from azure.ai.evaluation import AzureOpenAILabelGrader, evaluate

data_file_name="data.jsonl"

#  Evaluation criteria: Determine if the response column contains texts that are "too short", "just right", or "too long" and pass if it is "just right"
label_grader = AzureOpenAILabelGrader(
    model_config=model_config,
    input=[{"content": "{{item.response}}", "role": "user"}
           {"content":"Any text including space that's more than 600 characters are too long, less than 500 characters are too short; 500 to 600 characters are just right.", "role":"user", "type": "message"}],
    labels=["too short", "just right", "too long"],
    passing_labels=["just right"],
    model="gpt-4o",
    name="label",
)

label_grader_evaluation = evaluate(
    data=data_file_name,
    evaluators={
        "label": label_grader
    },
)
```

### Label grader output

For each of the sets of sample data contained in the data file, an evaluation result of `True` or `False` is returned signifying if the output matches with the passing label defined. The `score` is `1.0` for `True` cases while `score` is `0.0` for `False` cases. The reason for why the model provided the label for the data can be found in `content` under `outputs.label.sample`.

```python
'outputs.label.sample':
...
...
    'output': [{'role': 'assistant',
      'content': '{"steps":[{"description":"Calculate the number of characters in the user\'s input including spaces.","conclusion":"The provided text contains 575 characters."},{"description":"Evaluate if the character count falls within the given ranges (greater than 600 too long, less than 500 too short, 500 to 600 just right).","conclusion":"The character count falls between 500 and 600, categorized as \'just right.\'"}],"result":"just right"}'}],
...
...
'outputs.label.label_result': 'pass',
'outputs.label.passed': True,
'outputs.label.score': 1.0
```

Aside from individual data evaluation results, the grader also returns a metric indicating the overall dataset pass rate.

```python
'metrics': {'label.pass_rate': 0.2}, #1/5 in this case
```

## String checker

Compares input text to a reference value, checking for exact or partial matches with optional case insensitivity. Useful for flexible text validations and pattern matching.

### String checker example

```python
from azure.ai.evaluation import AzureOpenAIStringCheckGrader

# Evaluation criteria: Pass if the query column contains "What is"
string_grader = AzureOpenAIStringCheckGrader(
    model_config=model_config,
    input="{{item.query}}",
    name="starts with what is",
    operation="like", # "eq" for equal, "ne" for not equal, "like" for contain, "ilike" for case insensitive contain
    reference="What is",
)

string_grader_evaluation = evaluate(
    data=data_file_name,
    evaluators={
        "string": string_grader
    },
)
```

### String checker output

For each of the sets of sample data contained in the data file, an evaluation result of `True` or `False` is returned signifying if the input text matches with pattern matching rules defined. The `score` is `1.0` for `True` cases while `score` is `0.0` for `False` cases.

```python
'outputs.string.string_result': 'pass',
'outputs.string.passed': True,
'outputs.string.score': 1.0
```

The grader also returns a metric indicating the overall dataset pass rate.

```python
'metrics': {'string.pass_rate': 0.4}, #2/5 in this case
```

## Text similarity

Evaluates how closely input text matches a reference value using similarity metrics like`fuzzy_match`, `BLEU`, `ROUGE`, or `METEOR`. Useful for assessing text quality or semantic closeness.

### Text similarity example

```python
from azure.ai.evaluation import AzureOpenAITextSimilarityGrader

# Evaluation criteria: Pass if response column and ground_truth column similarity score >= 0.5 using "fuzzy_match"
sim_grader = AzureOpenAITextSimilarityGrader(
    model_config=model_config,
    evaluation_metric="fuzzy_match", # support evaluation metrics including: "fuzzy_match", "bleu", "gleu", "meteor", "rouge_1", "rouge_2", "rouge_3", "rouge_4", "rouge_5", "rouge_l", "cosine",
    input="{{item.response}}",
    name="similarity",
    pass_threshold=0.5,
    reference="{{item.ground_truth}}",
)

sim_grader_evaluation = evaluate(
    data=data_file_name,
    evaluators={
        "similarity": sim_grader
    },
)
evaluation
```

### Text similarity output

For each set of sample data contained in the data file, a numerical similarity score is generated. This score, ranging from 0 to 1, indicates the degree of similarity, with higher scores representing greater similarity. Additionally, an evaluation result of `True` or `False` is returned, signifying whether the similarity score meets or exceeds the specified threshold based on the evaluation metric defined in the grader.

```python
'outputs.similarity.similarity_result': 'pass',
'outputs.similarity.passed': True,
'outputs.similarity.score': 0.6117136659436009
```

The grader also returns a metric indicating the overall dataset pass rate.

```python
'metrics': {'similarity.pass_rate': 0.4}, #2/5 in this case
```

## General grader

Advanced users have the capability to import or define a custom grader and integrate it into the AOAI general grader. This allows for evaluations to be performed based on specific areas of interest aside from the existing AOAI graders. Following is an example to import the OpenAI `StringCheckGrader` and construct it to be ran as a AOAI general grader on Foundry SDK.

### Example

```python
from openai.types.graders import StringCheckGrader
from azure.ai.evaluation import AzureOpenAIGrader
 
# Define an string check grader config directly using the OAI SDK
# Evaluation criteria: Pass if query column contains "Northwind"
oai_string_check_grader = StringCheckGrader(
    input="{{item.query}}",
    name="contains hello",
    operation="like",
    reference="Northwind",
    type="string_check"
)
# Plug that into the general grader
general_grader = AzureOpenAIGrader(
    model_config=model_config,
    grader_config=oai_string_check_grader
)
evaluation = evaluate(
    data=data_file_name,
    evaluators={
        "general": general_grader,
    },
)
evaluation
```

### Output

For each set of sample data contained in the data file, general grader returns a numerical score that is a 0-1 float and a higher score is better. Given a numerical threshold defined as part of the custom grader, we also output `True` if the score >= threshold, or `False` otherwise.

For example:

```python
'outputs.general.general_result': 'pass',
'outputs.general.passed': True,
'outputs.general.score': 1.0
```

Aside from individual data evaluation results, the grader also returns a metric indicating the overall dataset pass rate.

```python
'metrics': {'general.pass_rate': 0.4}, #2/5 in this case
```
