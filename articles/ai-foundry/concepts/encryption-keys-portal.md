# Customer-managed keys for encryption with Azure AI Foundry

Customer-managed keys (CMKs) in [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) provide enhanced control over the encryption of your data. By using CMKs, you can manage your own encryption keys to add an extra layer of protection and meet compliance requirements more effectively.

## About encryption in Azure AI Foundry

Azure AI Foundry is a service in the Microsoft Azure cloud. By default,  services use Microsoft-managed encryption keys to encrypt data in transit and at rest.

::: zone pivot="hub-project"

Hub and [!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)] resources are implementations of the Azure Machine Learning workspace and encrypt data in transit and at rest. For details, see [Data encryption with Azure Machine Learning](../../machine-learning/concept-data-encryption.md).

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="fdp-project"

Data is encrypted and decrypted using [FIPS 140-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2) compliant [256-bit AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption. Encryption and decryption are transparent, meaning encryption and access are managed for you. Your data is secure by default and you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of encryption.

## Storage of encrypted data when using customer-managed keys

Customer-managed key encryption can be enabled during resource creation through the Azure portal or template options. The encrypted data is stored service-side on Microsoft-managed resources using your encryption key. 

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the dedicated hosting model for certain services when using customer-managed key encrypted data, additional charges may apply.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use server-side encryption, Azure charges will continue to accrue during the soft delete retention period.

## Service-side storage of encrypted data when using customer-managed keys with AI hub

Two architecture options are available when using customer-managed keys:

* **Encrypted data is stored in Microsoft subscription (recommended)**

  Data is stored service-side on Microsoft-managed resources instead of in managed resources in your subscription. Metadata is stored in multitenant resources using document-level CMK encryption. An Azure AI Search instance is hosted on the Microsoft-side per customer, and for each hub.

* **Encrypted data is stored in your subscription** 

   Data is stored in your subscription using a Microsoft-managed resource group that includes an Azure Storage account, Azure Cosmos DB resource and Azure AI Search. The configuration of these resources cannot be modified. Changes to its configurations are not supported. 

   All projects using the same hub store data on the resources in a managed resource group identified by the name `azureml-rg-hubworkspacename_GUID`. Projects use Microsoft Entra ID authentication when interacting with these resources. If your hub has a private link endpoint, network access to the managed resources is restricted. The managed resource group is deleted, when the hub is deleted. 

  The following data is stored on the managed resources.

  |Service|What it's used for|Example|
  |-----|-----|-----|
  |Azure Cosmos DB|Stores metadata for your Azure AI projects and tools|Index names, tags; Flow creation timestamps; deployment tags; evaluation metrics|
  |Azure AI Search|Stores indices that are used to help query your Azure AI Foundry content.|An index based off your model deployment names|
  |Azure Storage Account|Stores instructions for how customization tasks are orchestrated|JSON representation of flows you create in [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs)|

## Use customer-managed keys with Azure Key Vault

::: zone pivot="fdp-project"

You must use Azure Key Vault to store your customer-managed keys. You can either create your own keys and store them in a key vault, or you can use the Azure Key Vault APIs to generate keys. The Azure AI Foundry resource and the key vault must be in the same region and in the same Microsoft Entra tenant, but they can be in different subscriptions. For more information about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](/azure/key-vault/general/overview).

- You must enable both the **Soft Delete** and **Do Not Purge** properties on the key vault.
- If you use the [Key Vault firewall](/azure/key-vault/general/access-behind-firewall), you must allow trusted Microsoft services to access the key vault.
- You must grant your [!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)] system-assigned managed identity the following permissions on your key vault: *get key*, *wrap key*, *unwrap key*.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="hub-project"

You must use Azure Key Vault to store your customer-managed keys. You can either create your own keys and store them in a key vault, or you can use the Azure Key Vault APIs to generate keys. The Azure AI services resource and the key vault must be in the same region and in the same Microsoft Entra tenant, but they can be in different subscriptions. For more information about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](/azure/key-vault/general/overview).

To enable customer-managed keys, the key vault containing your keys must meet these requirements:

- You must enable both the **Soft Delete** and **Do Not Purge** properties on the key vault.
- If you use the [Key Vault firewall](/azure/key-vault/general/access-behind-firewall), you must allow trusted Microsoft services to access the key vault.
- You must grant your hub and Azure AI Services resource's system-assigned managed identity the following permissions on your key vault: *get key*, *wrap key*, *unwrap key*.

The following limitations hold for Azure AI Foundry:
- Only Azure Key Vault with [legacy access policies](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy) are supported.
- Only RSA and RSA-HSM keys of size 2048 are supported with Azure AI services encryption. For more information about keys, see **Key Vault keys** in [About Azure Key Vault keys, secrets, and certificates](/azure/key-vault/general/about-keys-secrets-certificates).
- Updates from Customer-Managed keys to Microsoft-managed keys are currently not supported for project sub-resources. Projects will keep referencing your encryption keys if updated.

### Enable your Azure AI Foundry resource's managed identity

Managed identity must be enabled as a prerequisite for using customer-managed keys.

1. Go to your Azure AI Foundry resource in Azure portal.
1. On the left, under **Resource Management**, select **Identity**.
1. Switch the system-assigned managed identity status to **On**.
1. Save your changes, and confirm that you want to enable the system-assigned managed identity.

## Enable customer-managed keys

::: zone pivot="fdp-project"

Customer-managed key encryption is configured via Azure portal in a similar way for each Azure resource:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Key Vault used for encryption **must be in the same resource group** as the AI Foundry project. Key Vaults in other resource groups are not currently supported by the deployment wizards or project configuration workflows.

1. Create a new Azure AI Foundry resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Under the **Encryption** tab, select **Customer-managed key**, **Select vault and key**, and then select the key vault and key to use.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/portal/customer-managed-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the encryption tab for an AI Foundry project with the option for customer-managed key selected." lightbox="../media/portal/customer-managed-key.png":::

1. Continue creating your resource as normal.

## Limitations

* The customer-managed key for encryption can only be updated to keys in the same Azure Key Vault instance.
* After deployment, your [!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)] can't switch from Microsoft-managed keys to customer-managed keys or vice versa.
* Azure charges for the AI Foundry resource will continue to accrue during the soft delete retention period. Charges for projects don't continue to accrue during the soft delete retention period.

::: zone pivot="hub-project"

Azure AI Foundry builds on hub as implementation of Azure Machine Learning workspace, Azure AI Services, and lets you connect with other resources in Azure. You must set encryption specifically on each resource.

Customer-managed key encryption is configured via Azure portal in a similar way for each Azure resource:
1. Create a new Azure resource in Azure portal.
1. Under the encryption tab, select your encryption key.

    :::image type="content" source="../../machine-learning/media/concept-customer-managed-keys/cmk-service-side-encryption.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the encryption tab with the option for service side encryption selected." lightbox="../../machine-learning/media/concept-customer-managed-keys/cmk-service-side-encryption.png":::

Alternatively, use infrastructure-as-code options for automation. Example Bicep templates for Azure AI Foundry are available on the Azure Quickstart repo:
1. [CMK encryption for hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/aifoundry-cmk).
1. [Service-side CMK encryption preview for hub](https://github.com/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/aistudio-cmk-service-side-encryption).

## Limitations

* The customer-managed key for encryption can only be updated to keys in the same Azure Key Vault instance.
* After deployment, hubs can't switch from Microsoft-managed keys to Customer-managed keys or vice versa.
* [Azure AI Foundry Customer-Managed Key Request Form](https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk) is required to use customer-managed keys in combination with Azure Speech and Content Moderator capabilities.
* [Azure AI Foundry Customer-Managed Key Request Form](https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk) is still required for Speech and Content Moderator.
* If your AI Foundry resource is in a soft-deleted state(#preview-service-side-storage-of-encrypted-data-when-using-customer-managed-keys), any additional Azure charges will continue to accrue during the soft delete retention period.
