# Ask the Foundry agent for help (preview)

## Overview

The Foundry agent is an experimental feature that is here to assist you with questions about Azure AI Foundry. To start using the Foundry agent, simply click on its icon located in the top right bar of the interface. A chat window opens where you can type your questions and receive answers in real-time.

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview.md)]

## Capabilities

**What The Foundry Agent Can Do** - The agent is designed to provide assistance by answering questions based on:

- **Azure AI Foundry Documentation**: This documentation includes details about Azure AI Foundry such as Quickstarts, How-Tos or reference documentation of the Azure AI Foundry SDK. The Foundry agent can help you navigate the documentation, or find answers for you.
- **Model Catalog**: The model catalog is a comprehensive hub for discovering, evaluating, and deploying a wide range of AI models. It features hundreds of models from various providers, including Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, NVIDIA, and Hugging Face, as well as models trained by Microsoft. The Foundry agent can provide information about the models available in the Azure AI Foundry catalog.

**What The Foundry Agent Cannot Do** - While the agent is a powerful tool, it has some limitations:

- **No Access to Your Resources**: the agent can't access your Azure resources. For example, it can't answer questions like "How much capacity do I have?" or "What is the status of my deployment?"
- **Limited Scope**: It's restricted to answering questions related to the Azure AI Foundry documentation and model catalog. It can't provide support for unrelated Azure services or external systems.

Use the Foundry agent to make the most of the Azure AI Foundry experience but keep its scope and limitations in mind when asking questions.
