# Foundry Local CLI Reference

[!INCLUDE [foundry-local-preview](./../includes/foundry-local-preview.md)]

This article provides a comprehensive reference for the Foundry Local command-line interface (CLI). The CLI organizes commands into logical categories to help you manage models, control the service, and maintain your local cache.

## Overview

View all available commands with the help option:

```bash
foundry --help
```

The CLI organizes commands into three main categories:

- **Model**: Commands for managing and running AI models
- **Service**: Commands for controlling the Foundry Local service
- **Cache**: Commands for managing your local model storage

## Model commands

The following table summarizes the commands related to managing and running models:

> [!NOTE]
> You can specify the `model` argument by its **alias** or **model ID**. Using an alias will:
> - Select the *best model* for your available hardware. For example, if you have a Nvidia CUDA GPU available, Foundry Local selects the CUDA model. If you have a supported NPU available, Foundry Local selects the NPU model.
> - Allow you to use a shorter name without needing to remember the model ID.
>
> If you want to run a specific model, you can use the model ID. For example, to run the `qwen2.5-0.5b` on CPU - irrespective of your available hardware - use: `foundry model run qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-generic-cpu`.
