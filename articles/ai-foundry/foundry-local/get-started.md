# Get started with Foundry Local

[!INCLUDE [foundry-local-preview](./includes/foundry-local-preview.md)]

This guide walks you through setting up Foundry Local to run AI models on your device.

## Prerequisites

Your system must meet the following requirements to run Foundry Local:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 (x64), Windows 11 (x64/ARM), Windows Server 2025, macOS.
- **Hardware**: Minimum 8 GB RAM and 3 GB free disk space. Recommended 16 GB RAM and 15 GB free disk space.
- **Network**: Internet connection to download the initial model (optional for offline use).
- **Acceleration (optional)**: NVIDIA GPU (2,000 series or newer), AMD GPU (6,000 series or newer), AMD NPU, Intel iGPU, Intel NPU (32GB or more of memory), Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite (8GB or more of memory), Qualcomm NPU, or Apple silicon.

> [!NOTE]
> New NPUs are supported only on systems running Windows 24H2 or later. If you use an Intel NPU on Windows, install the [Intel NPU driver](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/794734/intel-npu-driver-windows.html) to enable NPU acceleration in Foundry Local.

Make sure you have admin rights to install software.

> [!TIP]
> If you see a service connection error after installation (for example, 'Request to local service failed'), run `foundry service restart`.

## Quickstart

Get started fast with Foundry Local:

### Option 1: Quick CLI setup

1. **Install Foundry Local**.

   - **Windows**: Open a terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal
     ```
   - **macOS**: Open a terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     brew tap microsoft/foundrylocal
     brew install foundrylocal
     ```
     Alternatively, you can download the installer from the [Foundry Local GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/foundry-local-installer).

1. **Run your first model**. Open a terminal and run this command:

   ```bash
   foundry model run qwen2.5-0.5b
   ```

   Foundry Local downloads the model, which can take a few minutes depending on your internet speed, then runs it. After the model starts, interact with it by using the command-line interface (CLI). For example, you can ask:

   ```text
   Why is the sky blue?
   ```

   You see a response from the model in the terminal:
   :::image type="content" source="media/get-started-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of output from Foundry Local run command." lightbox="media/get-started-output.png":::

### Option 2: Download starter projects

For practical, hands-on learning, download one of our starter projects that demonstrate real-world scenarios:

- [Chat Application Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/tree/main/samples/electron/foundry-chat): Build a local chat interface with multiple model support.
- [Summarize Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/tree/main/samples/python/summarize): A command-line utility that generates summaries of text files or direct text input.
- [Function Calling Example](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/tree/main/samples/python/functioncalling): Enable and use function calling with Phi-4 mini.

Each project includes:

- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Complete source code
- Configuration examples
- Best practices

> [!TIP]
> These starter projects align with scenarios in the [how-to guides](how-to/how-to-chat-application-with-open-web-ui.md) and provide immediate practical value.

> [!TIP]
> Replace `qwen2.5-0.5b` with any model name from the catalog (run `foundry model list` to view available models). Foundry Local downloads the variant that best matches your system's hardware and software configuration. For example, if you have an NVIDIA GPU, Foundry Local downloads the CUDA version. If you have a Qualcomm NPU, Foundry Local downloads the NPU variant. If you have no GPU or NPU, Foundry Local downloads the CPU version.
>
> When you run `foundry model list` the first time, you see a download progress bar while Foundry Local downloads the execution providers for your hardware.

## Run the latest OpenAI open-source model

Run the latest OpenAI open-source model, `GPT-OSS-20B`, with this command:

```bash
foundry model run gpt-oss-20b
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requirements for running GPT-OSS-20B:
>
> - NVIDIA GPU with 16 GB of VRAM or more.
> - Foundry Local version **0.6.87** or later. Earlier versions don't support the model. Check your version with:
>
> ```bash
> foundry --version
> ```

## Explore commands

The Foundry CLI organizes commands into these main categories:

- **Model**: Commands for managing and running models.
- **Service**: Commands for managing the Foundry Local service.
- **Cache**: Commands for managing the local model cache (downloaded models on local disk).

View all commands:

```bash
foundry --help
```

View **model** commands:

```bash
foundry model --help
```

View **service** commands:

```bash
foundry service --help
```

View **cache** commands:

```bash
foundry cache --help
```

> [!TIP]
> For details on all CLI commands, see [Foundry Local CLI reference](reference/reference-cli.md).

## Upgrade Foundry Local

Run the command for your OS to upgrade Foundry Local.

- Windows: In a terminal, run:
  ```bash
  winget upgrade --id Microsoft.FoundryLocal
  ```
- macOS: In a terminal, run:
  ```bash
  brew upgrade foundrylocal
  ```

## Uninstall Foundry Local

To uninstall Foundry Local, run the command for your operating system:

- **Windows**: Open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  winget uninstall Microsoft.FoundryLocal
  ```
- **macOS**: Open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  brew rm foundrylocal
  brew untap microsoft/foundrylocal
  brew cleanup --scrub
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Service connection issues

If you see this error when you run `foundry model list` or a similar command:

```
>foundry model list

ðŸŸ¢ Service is Started on http://127.0.0.1:0/, PID 11192!

Exception: Request to local service failed. Uri:http://127.0.0.1:0/foundry/list

The requested address is not valid in its context. (127.0.0.1:0)

Please check service status with 'foundry service status'.
```

Run this command to restart the service:

```bash
foundry service restart
```

This command fixes cases where the service runs but isn't accessible because of a port binding issue.
