# What's new in Microsoft Foundry documentation?

Welcome! This article highlights key changes and updates in Microsoft Foundry documentation for December 2025.

This month marks a significant update to our documentation structure. With the introduction of the new Microsoft Foundry portal,
we now maintain two corresponding versions of the documentation to support each portal experience. This dual-version approach ensures that users can access accurate, version-specific guidance tailored to their portal environment.
