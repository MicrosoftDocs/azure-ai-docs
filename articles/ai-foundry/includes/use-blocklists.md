## Create a blocklist

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) and navigate to your project. Then select the **Guardrails + controls** page in the left navigation and select the **Blocklists** tab.

1. Select **Create a blocklist**. Enter a name for your blocklist, add a description, and select an Azure OpenAI resource to connect it to. Then select **Create Blocklist**.

1. Select your new blocklist. On the blocklist's page, select **Add new term**.

1. Enter the term that you want to filter and select **Add term**. You can also use a regex. You can delete each term in your blocklist.

## Attach a blocklist to a content filter configuration

1. After you create the blocklist, return to the **Guardrails + controls** page and select the **Content filters** tab. Create a new content filter configuration. A wizard opens with several AI content safety components.

1. On the **Input filter** and **Output filter** screens, turn on the **Blocklist** toggle. You can then select a blocklist from the list. 
    There are two types of blocklists: the custom blocklists you created, and prebuilt blocklists that Microsoft provides&mdash;in this case a Profanity blocklist (English).

1. Decide which of the available blocklists you want to include in your content filtering configuration. Review and finish the content filtering configuration by selecting **Next**. You can always go back and edit your configuration. When it's ready, select **Create content filter**. You can now apply the new configuration that includes your blocklists to a deployment.
