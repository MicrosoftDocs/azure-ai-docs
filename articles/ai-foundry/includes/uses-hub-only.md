> This article provides legacy support for hub-based projects. It will not work for **Foundry projects**. See [How do I know which type of project I have?](../what-is-foundry.md#how-do-i-know-which-type-of-project-i-have)

> **SDK compatibility note**: Code examples require a specific Microsoft Foundry SDK version. If you encounter compatibility issues, consider [migrating from a hub-based to a Foundry project](../how-to/migrate-project.md).
