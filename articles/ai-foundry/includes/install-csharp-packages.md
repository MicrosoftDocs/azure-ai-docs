To work with Azure AI services in your .NET project, you'll need to install several NuGet packages. Add NuGet packages using the .NET CLI in the integrated terminal:
    
```bash
# Add Azure AI SDK packages
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Projects
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Agents.Persistent
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Inference
```
