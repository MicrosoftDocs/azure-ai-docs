> [!NOTE]
> You must use a **Foundry project** for this feature. A **hub-based project** isn't supported. See [How do I know which type of project I have?](../what-is-foundry.md#how-do-i-know-which-type-of-project-i-have) and [Create a Foundry project](../how-to/create-projects.md?pivots="fdp-project"). To migrate your hub-based project to a Foundry project, see [Migrate from hub-based to Foundry projects](../how-to/migrate-project.md).
