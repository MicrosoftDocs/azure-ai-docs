Your project connection string is required to call the Azure OpenAI service from your code. In this quickstart, you save this value in a `.env` file, which is a file that contains environment variables that your application can read. 

Create a `.env` file, and paste the following code:

```text
AIPROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING=<your-connection-string>
AISEARCH_INDEX_NAME="example-index"
EMBEDDINGS_MODEL="text-embedding-ada-002"
INTENT_MAPPING_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
CHAT_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
EVALUATION_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
```

* Find your connection string in the Azure AI Foundry project you created in the [Azure AI Foundry playground quickstart](../quickstarts/get-started-playground.md).  Open the project, then find the connection string on the **Overview** page.  Copy the connection string and paste it into the `.env` file.

* If you don't yet have a search index, keep the value "example-index" for `AISEARCH_INDEX_NAME`. In Part 2 of this tutorial you'll create the index using this name. If you have previously created a search index that you want to use instead, update the value to match the name of that search index.  

* If you changed the names of the models when you deployed them, update the values in the `.env` file to match the names you used.

> [!TIP]
> If you're working in VS Code, close and reopen the terminal window after you've saved changes in the `.env` file.

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that your `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file so that you don't accidentally check it into your git repository.
