In the portal, you can explore a rich catalog of cutting-edge models from many different providers. For this tutorial, search and then select the **gpt-4o** model.

1. [!INCLUDE [classic-sign-in](classic-sign-in.md)]
1. If you're in a project, select **Microsoft Foundry** in the upper-left breadcrumb to leave the project. You'll create a new one in a moment.
1. From the landing page or **[Model catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)**, select **gpt-4o** (or **gpt-4o-mini**).

1. Select **Use this model**. When prompted, enter a new project name and select **Create**.
1. Review the deployment name and select **Create**.
1. Then select **Connect and deploy** after selecting a deployment type.
1. Select **Open in playground** from the deployment page after it's deployed.
1. You land in the Chat playground with the model pre-deployed and ready to use.

If you're building an agent, you can instead start with **Create an agent**. The steps are similar, but in a different order.  Once the project is created, you arrive at the Agent playground instead of the Chat playground.
