## Viewing AI red teaming results in Azure AI Foundry project (preview)

After your automated scan finishes, the results also get logged to your Azure AI Foundry project, which you specified in the creation of your AI red teaming agent.

### View report of each scan

In your Azure AI Foundry project or hub-based project, navigate to the **Evaluation** page. Select **AI red teaming** to view the report with detailed drill-down results of each scan.

When you select into the scan, you can view the report by risk categories, which shows the overall number of successful attacks and a breakdown of successful attacks per risk categories:

Or by attack complexity classification:

Drilling down further into the data tab provides a row-level view of each attack-response pair. This information offers deeper insights into system issues and behaviors. For each attack-response pair, you can see more information, such as whether or not the attack was successful, what attack strategy was used, and its attack complexity. A human in the loop reviewer can provide human feedback by selecting the thumbs up or thumbs down icon.

To view each conversation, select **View more** to see the full conversation for more detailed analysis of the AI system's response.
