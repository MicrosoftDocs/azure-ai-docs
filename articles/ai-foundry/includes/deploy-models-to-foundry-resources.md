We recommend that you deploy Foundry Models to Azure AI Foundry resources. This deployment method allows you to consume your models via a single endpoint with the same authentication and schema to generate inference for the deployed models in the resource. The endpoint follows the [Azure AI Model Inference API](/rest/api/aifoundry/modelinference/) which all the models in Foundry Models support. To learn how to deploy a Foundry Model to the Azure AI Foundry resources, see [Add and configure models to Azure AI Foundry Models](../model-inference/how-to/create-model-deployments.md).
