1. Select **+ Add** > **Add role assignment**.
1. Search for the role you need to assign and select it. Then select **Next**.
1. When assigning a role to yourself: 
    1. Select **User, group, or service principal**. 
    1. Select **Select members**.
    1. Search for your name and select it.
1. When assigning a role to another resource: 
    1. Select **Managed identity**. 
    1. Select **Select members**.
    1. Use the dropdown to find the type of resource you want to assign. For example, **Azure AI services** or **Search service**.
