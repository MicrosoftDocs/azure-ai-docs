If this is your first time running evaluations and logging it to your Azure AI Foundry project, you might need to do a few additional steps:

1. Create and connect your storage account to your Azure AI Foundry project at the resource level. There are two ways you can do this. You can [use a Bicep template](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/microsoft/infrastructure-setup/01-connections/connection-storage-account.bicep), which provisions and connects a storage account to your Foundry project with key authentication. You can also [manually create and provision access](../how-to/evaluations-storage-account.md) to your storage account in the Azure portal.
1. Make sure the connected storage account has access to all projects.
1. If you connected your storage account with Microsoft Entra ID, make sure to give managed identity **Storage Blob Data Owner** permissions to both your account and the Foundry project resource in the Azure portal.
