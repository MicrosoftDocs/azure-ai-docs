## First run experience

Use this fast path when you don't have any projects yet.

In the portal, you can explore a rich catalog of cutting-edge models from Microsoft, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Hugging Face, Meta, and more. For this tutorial, search and then select the **gpt-4o** model.

1. Sign in to the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).
1.  From the overview page or **[Model catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)**, select **gpt-4o** (or **gpt-4o-mini**).

    :::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/start-building.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to start with a model in Azure AI Foundry portal.":::

1. Select **Use this model**. When prompted, enter a project name and select **Create**.
1. Review the deployment name and select **Create**.
1. Then select **Connect and deploy** after selecting a deployment type.
1. Select **Open in playground** from the deployment page after it's deployed.
1. You land in the Chat playground with the model pre-deployed and ready to use.

If you're building an agent, you can instead start with **Create an agent**. The steps are similar, but in a different order.  Once the project is created, you arrive at the Agent playground instead of the Chat playground.
