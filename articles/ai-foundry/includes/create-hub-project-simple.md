    > You must have an existing [!INCLUDE [fdp-project-name](fdp-project-name.md)] or [!INCLUDE [hub-project-name](hub-project-name.md)] before you can follow these steps. If you don't have an existing project, follow the steps in the [Quickstart: Get started with Azure AI Foundry](../quickstarts/get-started-code.md) to create your first [!INCLUDE [fdp-project-name](fdp-project-name.md)].
