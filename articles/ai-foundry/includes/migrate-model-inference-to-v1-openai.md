> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're currently using an Azure AI Inference beta SDK with Microsoft Foundry Models or Azure OpenAI service, we strongly recommend that you transition to the generally available [OpenAI/v1 API](https://aka.ms/openai/v1), which uses an OpenAI stable SDK.
>
> For more information on how to migrate to the OpenAI/v1 API by using an SDK in your programming language of choice, see [Migrate from Azure AI Inference SDK to OpenAI SDK](../how-to/model-inference-to-openai-migration.md).
