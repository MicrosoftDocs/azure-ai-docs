> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for the Azure AI model inference SDK ends in MM-YYYY. Although the Azure AI model inference SDK is still supported, we recommend that you transition to the next generation [v1 Azure OpenAI APIs](../openai/api-version-lifecycle.md#api-evolution) for your inferencing tasks by using the v1 chat completions API with Foundry Models and the v1 responses API with Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models. Non-chat models like embedding models or image generation models aren't currently supported in the v1 Azure OpenAI APIs. For these models, you can continue to use the Azure AI model inference SDK.
>
> For more information on how to migrate to the v1 Azure OpenAI APIs, see [Migrate from Azure AI Inference SDK to OpenAI v1 SDK](../how-to/model-inference-to-openai-migration.md).
