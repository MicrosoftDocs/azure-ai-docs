A **[!INCLUDE [hub](hub-project-name.md)]** is hosted by an [Azure AI Foundry hub](../concepts/ai-resources.md). If your company has an administrative team that has created a hub for you, you can create a project from that hub. If you are working on your own, you can create a project and a default hub will automatically be created for you.
