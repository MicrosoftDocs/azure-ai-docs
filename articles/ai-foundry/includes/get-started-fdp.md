In this quickstart, you use [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a project
> * Deploy a model
> * Run a chat completion
> * Create and run an agent
> * Upload files to the agent

The Azure AI Foundry SDK is available in multiple languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, and C#. This quickstart provides instructions for each of these languages.

> [!TIP]
> The rest of this article shows how to create and use a **[!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]**. Select **[!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)]** at the top of this article if you want to use a [!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)] instead. [Which type of project do I need?](../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#which-type-of-project-do-i-need)

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.
- You must be **Owner** of the subscription to receive the appropriate access control needed to use your project.

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](feature-preview.md)]

## Start with a project and model

1. Sign in to the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).
1. In the portal, you can explore a rich catalog of cutting-edge models from Microsoft, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Hugging Face, Meta, and more. For this tutorial, search and then 
select the **gpt-4o** model.

## Run a chat completion

Chat completions are the basic building block of AI applications. Using chat completions you can send a list of messages and get a response from the model.

# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

1. In the chat playground, fill in the prompt and select the **Send** button.
1. The model returns a response in the **Response** pane.

# [Python](#tab/python)

Substitute your endpoint for the `endpoint` in this code:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/python/mslearn-resources/quickstart/quickstart.py" id="chat_completion":::


# [Java (preview)](#tab/java)

:::code language="java" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/java/mslearn-resources/quickstart/src/main/java/com/azure/ai/foundry/samples/ChatCompletionSample.java" :::

## Chat with an agent

Agents have powerful capabilities through the use of tools. Start by chatting with an agent.
 
# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

When you're ready to try an agent, a default agent is created for you. To chat with this agent:

1. On the left pane, select **Playgrounds**.
1. In the **Agents playground** card, select **Let's go**.
1. Add instructions, such as, "You are a helpful writing assistant."
1. Start chatting with your agent, for example, "Write me a poem about flowers."

# [Python](#tab/python)

Substitute your endpoint for the `endpoint` in this code:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/python/mslearn-resources/quickstart/quickstart.py" id="create_and_run_agent":::

# [Java (preview)](#tab/java)

:::code language="java" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/java/mslearn-resources/quickstart/src/main/java/com/azure/ai/foundry/samples/AgentSample.java" :::

## Add files to the agent

Now let's add a file search tool that enables us to do knowledge retrieval.

* Download [product_info_1.md](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/microsoft/data/product_info_1.md) to give to your agent.


# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

1. In your agent's **Setup** pane, scroll down if necessary to find **Knowledge**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Select **Files** to upload the **product_info_1.md** file.
1. Select **Select local files** under **Add files**.
1. Select **Upload and save**.
1. Change your agents instructions, such as, "You are a helpful assistant and can search information from uploaded files."
1. Ask a question, such as, "Hello, what Contoso products do you know?"
1. To add more files, select the **...** on the AgentVectorStore, then select **Manage**.

# [Python](#tab/python)
