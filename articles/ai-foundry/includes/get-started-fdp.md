In this quickstart, you use [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a project
> * Deploy a model
> * Run a chat completion
> * Create and run an agent
> * Upload files to the agent

The Azure AI Foundry SDK is available in multiple languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, and C#. This quickstart provides instructions for each of these languages.

> [!TIP]
> The rest of this article shows how to use a **[!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]**. Select **[!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)]** at the top of this article if you want to use a [!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)] instead. [Which type of project do I need?](../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#which-type-of-project-do-i-need)

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.
- You must be **Owner** of the subscription to receive the appropriate access control needed to use your project.

## Run a chat completion

Chat completions are the basic building block of AI applications. Using chat completions you can send a list of messages and get a response from the model.

# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

1. In the chat playground, fill in the prompt and select the **Send** button.
1. The model returns a response in the **Response** pane.

# [Python](#tab/python)

Substitute your endpoint for the `endpoint` in this code:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/python/mslearn-resources/quickstart/quickstart.py" id="chat_completion":::


# [Java (preview)](#tab/java)

Set these environment variables:

- **AZURE_ENDPOINT**: Required. The base endpoint for your Azure AI service.
- AZURE_AI_API_KEY: Optional. The API key for authentication (falls back to DefaultAzureCredential if not provided).
- AZURE_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: Optional. The model deployment name (defaults to "phi-4").
- AZURE_MODEL_API_PATH: Optional. The API path segment (defaults to "deployments").
- CHAT_PROMPT: Optional. The prompt to send to the model (uses a default if not provided).

## Chat with an agent

Agents have powerful capabilities through the use of tools. Start by chatting with an agent.
 
# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

When you're ready to try an agent, a default agent is created for you. To chat with this agent:

1. On the left pane, select **Playgrounds**.

## Add files to the agent

Now let's add a file search tool that enables us to do knowledge retrieval.

* Download [product_info_1.md](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/microsoft/data/product_info_1.md) to give to your agent.


# [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)
