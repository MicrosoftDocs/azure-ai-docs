## Microsoft Foundry portals

There are two different portals for you to use to interact with Microsoft Foundry. A toggle in the portal banner allows you to switch between the two versions.

| Portal  | Banner&nbsp;display  | When to use |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Microsoft Foundry (classic) | :::image type="icon" source="../media/version-banner/classic-foundry.png" border="false"::: | Choose this portal when working with multiple resource types: Azure OpenAI, Foundry resources, hub-based projects, or Foundry projects. |
| Microsoft Foundry (new) | :::image type="icon" source="../media/version-banner/new-foundry.png" border="false"::: | Choose this portal for a seamless experience that combines simplicity with powerful and secure tools to build, manage and grow multi-agent applications. Only Foundry projects are visible here - use (classic) for all other resource types. |

> [!TIP]
> All links to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) open whichever version you last used.
