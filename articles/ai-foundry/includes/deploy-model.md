To work with a model, you first deploy it into a project. 

[!INCLUDE [tip-left-pane](tip-left-pane.md)]

1. [!INCLUDE [classic-sign-in](classic-sign-in.md)]
1. Studio remembers where you were last, so what you do next depends on where you are:

    * If you see a list of projects, select the one you want to use.  You can use either a [!INCLUDE [hub-project-name](hub-project-name.md)] or a [!INCLUDE [fdp-project-name](fdp-project-name.md)].
    * If you're already in a project and want to use a new one, select **Microsoft Foundry** in the top left corner, then select **Create new** to create the new project.
    * If you're new to Foundry and don't have any projects, use [Quickstart: Get started with Foundry](../quickstarts/get-started-code.md) instead of this article.

1. Select **Model catalog** from the left pane.

1. Select the **gpt-4o-mini** model from the list of models. You can use the search bar to find it.

1. Leave the default **Deployment name**. Select **Deploy**.
