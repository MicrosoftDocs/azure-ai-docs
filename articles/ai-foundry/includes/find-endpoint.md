> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the **Azure AI Foundry project endpoint**, you're using a [!INCLUDE [hub-project-name](hub-project-name.md)]. (See [Types of projects](../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#project-types)). Switch to a [!INCLUDE [fdp-project-name](fdp-project-name.md)], or use the preceding steps to create one.
