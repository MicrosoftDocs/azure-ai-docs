## Clean-up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure portal](../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)

## Troubleshooting

> [!NOTE]
> When using `gpt-4o-audio-preview` for chat completions with the audio modality and `stream` is set to true the only supported audio format is pcm16.
