- **[Registration is required for access to the gpt-5-codex model](https://aka.ms/oai/gpt5access).** If you have previously registered and obtained access to other limited access models like `gpt-5` you do not need to reapply and will automatically be granted access.

## Sora video-to-video support 

The Sora model from OpenAI now supports video-to-video generation. You can provide a short video as input to generate a new, longer video that incorporates the input video. See the [quickstart](./video-generation-quickstart.md) to get started.

## August 2025

### Sora image-to-video support

The Sora model from OpenAI now supports image-to-video generation. You can provide an image as input to the model to generate a video that incorporates the content of the image. You can also specify the frame of the video in which the image should appear: it doesn't need to be the beginning. See the [quickstart](./video-generation-quickstart.md) to get started.

Sora is now available in the Sweden Central region as well as East US 2.


### Realtime API audio model GA

OpenAI's GPT RealTime and Audio models are now generally available on Azure AI Foundry Direct Models.

Model improvements:
- Improved instruction following: Enhanced capabilities to follow tone, pacing, and escalation instructions more accurately and reliably. Can also switch languages.
- New standard voices, Marin and Cedar, that bring improved naturalness and clarity to speech synthesis.
- Improved audio quality: Glitch-free output, improved alphanumeric reproduction, and modality control.

Realtime API service improvements:
- Image Input: Add and discuss images via voice without video requirements.
- Improved function calling: Enhanced ability to call custom code defined by developers. Async function calling is supported, allowing sessions to continue while a function call is pending.
- Conversation Mode: Real-world turn-taking behavior for natural interactions. Conversation mode uses VAD to prompt users if no response is detected, improving real-world usability for phone-like interactions.
- SIP entry supported: public SIP URI, SIPS/SRTP, PSTN, HD Voice.

### Preference fine-tuning (preview)

[Direct preference optimization (DPO)](./how-to/fine-tuning-direct-preference-optimization.md) is a new alignment technique for large language models, designed to adjust model weights based on human preferences. Unlike reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), DPO doesn't require fitting a reward model and uses simpler data (binary preferences) for training. This method is computationally lighter and faster, making it equally effective at alignment while being more efficient. DPO is especially useful in scenarios where subjective elements like tone, style, or specific content preferences are important. Weâ€™re excited to announce the public preview of DPO in Azure OpenAI, starting with the `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model.

For fine-tuning model region availability, see the [models page](./concepts/models.md#fine-tuning-models).

### Stored completions & distillation

[Stored completions](./how-to/stored-completions.md) allow you to capture the conversation history from chat completions sessions to use as datasets for [evaluations](./how-to/evaluations.md) and [fine-tuning](./how-to/fine-tuning.md).
