# Protected material detection filter

The Protected material detection filter scans the output of large language models (LLMs) to identify and flag known protected material. It is designed to help organizations prevent the generation of content that closely matches copyrighted text or code.

The Protected material text filter flags known text content (for example, song lyrics, articles, recipes, and selected web content) that might be output by large language models.

The Protected material code filter flags protected code content (from known GitHub repositories, including software libraries, source code, algorithms, and other proprietary programming content) that might be output by large language models.
