## GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo

GPT-4o integrates text and images in a single model, enabling it to handle multiple data types simultaneously. This multimodal approach enhances accuracy and responsiveness in human-computer interactions. GPT-4o matches GPT-4 Turbo in English text and coding tasks while offering superior performance in non-English languages and vision tasks, setting new benchmarks for AI capabilities.

### How do I access the GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models?

GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini are available for **standard** and **global-standard** model deployment.

You need to [create](../how-to/create-resource.md) or use an existing resource in a [supported standard](#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-model-availability) or [global standard](#global-standard-model-availability) region where the model is available.

When your resource is created, you can [deploy](../how-to/create-resource.md#deploy-a-model) the GPT-4o models. If you are performing a programmatic deployment, the **model** names are:

- `gpt-4o` **Version** `2024-11-20`
- `gpt-4o` **Version** `2024-08-06`
- `gpt-4o` **Version** `2024-05-13`
- `gpt-4o-mini` **Version** `2024-07-18`

### GPT-4 Turbo

GPT-4 Turbo is a large multimodal model (accepting text or image inputs and generating text) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of OpenAI's previous models. Like GPT-3.5 Turbo, and older GPT-4 models GPT-4 Turbo is optimized for chat and works well for traditional completions tasks.

## GPT-4

GPT-4 is the predecessor to GPT-4 Turbo. Both the GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models have a base model name of `gpt-4`. You can distinguish between the GPT-4 and Turbo models by examining the model version.

- `gpt-4` **Version** `0314`
- `gpt-4` **Version** `0613`
- `gpt-4-32k` **Version** `0613`

You can see the token context length supported by each model in the [model summary table](#model-summary-table-and-region-availability).

## GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models

- These models can only be used with the Chat Completion API.

See [model versions](../concepts/model-versions.md) to learn about how Azure OpenAI handles model version upgrades, and [working with models](../how-to/working-with-models.md) to learn how to view and configure the model version settings of your GPT-4 deployments.

> [!CAUTION]
> We don't recommend using preview models in production. We will upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable GA version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

## GPT-3.5

GPT-3.5 models can understand and generate natural language or code. The most capable and cost effective model in the GPT-3.5 family is GPT-3.5 Turbo, which has been optimized for chat and works well for traditional completions tasks as well. GPT-3.5 Turbo is available for use with the Chat Completions API. GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct has similar capabilities to `text-davinci-003` using the Completions API instead of the Chat Completions API.  We recommend using GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct over [legacy GPT-3.5 and GPT-3 models](./legacy-models.md).


|  Model ID   | Description | Max Request (tokens) | Training Data (up to) |
|  --------- |:---|:------:|:----:|
| `gpt-35-turbo` (0125) **NEW** | **Latest GA Model** <br> - JSON Mode <br> - parallel function calling <br> - reproducible output (preview) <br> - Higher accuracy at responding in requested formats. <br> - Fix for a bug which caused a text encoding issue for non-English language function calls.  | Input: 16,385<br> Output: 4,096  | Sep 2021 |
| `gpt-35-turbo` (1106) | **Older GA Model** <br> - JSON Mode <br> - parallel function calling <br> - reproducible output (preview) | Input: 16,385<br> Output: 4,096 |  Sep 2021|
| `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` (0914) | **Completions endpoint only** <br> - Replacement for [legacy completions models](./legacy-models.md) | 4,097 |Sep 2021 |

To learn more about how to interact with GPT-3.5 Turbo and the Chat Completions API check out our [in-depth how-to](../how-to/chatgpt.md).

**<sup>1</sup>** This model will accept requests > 4,096 tokens. It is not recommended to exceed the 4,096 input token limit as the newer version of the model are capped at 4,096 tokens. If you encounter issues when exceeding 4,096 input tokens with this model this configuration is not officially supported.

## Embeddings

 `text-embedding-3-large` is the latest and most capable embedding model. Upgrading between embeddings models is not possible. In order to move from using `text-embedding-ada-002` to `text-embedding-3-large` you would need to generate new embeddings. 

- `text-embedding-3-large`
- `text-embedding-3-small`
- `text-embedding-ada-002`

In testing, OpenAI reports both the large and small third generation embeddings models offer better average multi-language retrieval performance with the [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl) benchmark while still maintaining performance for English tasks with the [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) benchmark.

|Evaluation Benchmark| `text-embedding-ada-002` | `text-embedding-3-small` |`text-embedding-3-large` |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIRACL average | 31.4 | 44.0 | 54.9 |
| MTEB average | 61.0 | 62.3 | 64.6 |

The third generation embeddings models support reducing the size of the embedding via a new `dimensions` parameter. Typically larger embeddings are more expensive from a compute, memory, and storage perspective. Being able to adjust the number of dimensions allows more control over overall cost and performance. The `dimensions` parameter is not supported in all versions of the OpenAI 1.x Python library, to take advantage of this parameter  we recommend upgrading to the latest version: `pip install openai --upgrade`.

OpenAI's MTEB benchmark testing found that even when the third generation model's dimensions are reduced to less than `text-embeddings-ada-002` 1,536 dimensions performance remains slightly better.

## Image generation models

The image generation models generate images from text prompts that the user provides. GPT-image-1 is in limited access public preview. DALL-E 3 is generally available for use with the REST APIs. DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 with client SDKs are in preview.

### Availability

**For access to `gpt-image-1` registration is required, and access will be granted based on Microsoft's eligibility criteria**. Customers who have access to other limited access models will still need to request access for this model.

Request access: [`gpt-image-1` limited access model application](https://aka.ms/oai/gptimage1access)

Once access has been granted, you will need to create a deployment for the model.

## Model summary table and region availability

### Models by deployment type

Azure OpenAI provides customers with choices on the hosting structure that fits their business and usage patterns. The service offers two main types of deployment: 

- **Standard** is offered with a global deployment option, routing traffic globally to provide higher throughput.
- **Provisioned** is also offered with a global deployment option, allowing customers to purchase and deploy provisioned throughput units across Azure global infrastructure.

All deployments can perform the exact same inference operations, however the billing, scale, and performance are substantially different. To learn more about Azure OpenAI deployment types see our [deployment types guide](../how-to/deployment-types.md).

## Assistants (Preview)

For Assistants you need a combination of a supported model, and a supported region. Certain tools and capabilities require the latest models. The following models are available in the Assistants API, SDK, and Azure AI Foundry. The following table is for standard deployment. For information on Provisioned Throughput Unit (PTU) availability, see [provisioned throughput](./provisioned-throughput.md). The listed models and regions can be used with both Assistants v1 and v2. You can use [global standard models](#global-standard-model-availability) if they are supported in the regions listed below.
