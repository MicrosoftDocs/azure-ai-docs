|Feature | Benefit|
|---|---|
|Hourly, uncommitted usage | Hourly payment option without a required commitment enables short-term deployment scenarios |
|Term discounts via Azure Reservations | Azure reservations provide substantial discounts over the hourly rate for one month and one year terms, and provide flexible scopes that minimize administration and associated with todayâ€™s resource-bound commitments.|
| Default provisioned-managed quota in many regions | Get started quickly in new regions without having to first request quota |
| Flexible choice of payment model for existing provisioned customers | Customers with commitments can stay on the commitment model at least through the end of 2024, and can choose to migrate existing commitments to hourly/reservations via a self-service or managed process. |
| Supports latest model generations | The hourly/reservation model will be required to deploy models released after August 1, 2024. |
