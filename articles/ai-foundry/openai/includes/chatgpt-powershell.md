## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- <a href="https://aka.ms/installpowershell" target="_blank">You can use either the latest version, PowerShell 7, or Windows PowerShell 5.1.</a>
- An Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry Models resource with a model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).
- An Azure OpenAI resource with the `gpt-4o` model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).


### Microsoft Entra ID prerequisites

For the recommended keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to:
- Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) used for keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Assign the `Cognitive Services User` role to your user account. You can assign roles in the Azure portal under **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**.

## Retrieve resource information

[!INCLUDE [resource authentication](resource-authentication.md)]

## Create a new PowerShell script

1. For the **recommended** keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, sign in to Azure with the following command:

    ```console
    az login
    ```

1. Create a new PowerShell file called *quickstart.ps1*. Then open it up in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Replace the contents of *quickstart.ps1* with the following code. You need to set the `engine` variable to the deployment name you chose when you deployed the GPT-4o model. Entering the model name results in an error unless you chose a deployment name that is identical to the underlying model name.

    ```powershell-interactive
    # Azure OpenAI metadata variables
    $openai = @{
       api_base    = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
       api_version = '2024-10-21' # This can change in the future.
       name        = 'gpt-4o' # The name you chose for your model deployment.
    }
    
    # Use the recommended keyless authentication via bearer token.
    $headers = [ordered]@{
        #'api-key' = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
        'Authorization' = "Bearer $($Env:DEFAULT_AZURE_CREDENTIAL_TOKEN)"
    }
    
    # Completion text
    $messages = @()
    $messages += @{
      role = 'system'
      content = 'You are a helpful assistant.'
    }
    $messages += @{
      role = 'user'
      content = 'Can I use honey as a substitute for sugar?'
    }
    $messages += @{
      role = 'assistant'
      content = 'Yes, you can use honey as a substitute for sugar.'
    }
    $messages += @{
      role = 'user'
      content = 'What other ingredients can I use as a substitute for sugar?'
    }
    
    # Adjust these values to fine-tune completions
    $body = [ordered]@{
       messages = $messages
    } | ConvertTo-Json
    
    # Send a request to generate an answer
    $url = "$($openai.api_base)/openai/deployments/$($openai.name)/chat/completions?api-version=$($openai.api_version)"
    
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Body $body -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json'
    return $response
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [The PowerShell Secret Management with Azure Key Vault](/powershell/utility-modules/secretmanagement/how-to/using-azure-keyvault). For more information about credential security, see this [security](../../../ai-services/security-features.md) article.

1. Run the script using PowerShell. In this example, we're using the `-Depth` parameter to ensure that the output isn't truncated. 

   ```powershell
   ./quickstart.ps1 | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4
   ```

## Output

The output of the script is a JSON object that contains the response from the Azure OpenAI. The output looks similar to the following:

```json

        "content": "There are many alternatives to sugar that can be used in cooking and baking, depending on your dietary needs, taste preferences, and the type of recipe you're making. Here are some popular sugar substitutes:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Natural Sweeteners**\n   - **Maple Syrup**: A natural sweetener with a rich, distinct flavor. Use about ¾ cup of maple syrup for every cup of sugar, and reduce the liquid in the recipe slightly.\n   - **Agave Nectar**: A liquid sweetener that’s sweeter than sugar. Use about ⅔ cup of agave nectar for each cup of sugar, and reduce the liquid in the recipe.\n   - **Coconut Sugar**: Made from the sap of the coconut palm, it has a mild caramel flavor. Substitute in a 1:1 ratio for sugar.\n   - **Molasses**: A by-product of sugar production, molasses is rich in flavor and best for recipes like gingerbread or barbecue sauce. Adjust quantities based on the recipe.\n   - **Stevia (Natural)**: Derived from the stevia plant, it's intensely sweet and available in liquid or powder form. Use sparingly, as a little goes a long way.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Fruit-Based Sweeteners**\n   - **Ripe Bananas**: Mashed bananas work well for baking recipes like muffins or pancakes. Use about ½ cup of mashed banana for every cup of sugar and reduce the liquid slightly.\n   - **Applesauce**: Unsweetened applesauce adds sweetness and moisture to baked goods. Replace sugar in a 1:1 ratio, but reduce the liquid by ¼ cup.\n   - **Dates/Date Paste**: Blend dates with water to make a paste, which works well in recipes like energy bars, cakes, or smoothies. Use in a 1:1 ratio for sugar.\n   - **Fruit Juices (e.g., orange juice)**: Can be used to impart natural sweetness but is best suited for specific recipes like marinades or desserts.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Artificial and Low-Calorie Sweeteners**\n   - **Erythritol**: A sugar alcohol with no calories. Substitute in equal amounts, but be careful as it may cause a cooling sensation in some recipes.\n   - **Xylitol**: Another sugar alcohol, often used in gum and candies. It’s a 1:1 sugar substitute but may affect digestion if consumed in large quantities.\n   - **Monk Fruit Sweetener**: A natural, calorie-free sweetener that’s significantly sweeter than sugar. Follow the product packaging for exact substitution measurements.\n   - **Aspartame, Sucralose, or Saccharin** (Artificial Sweeteners): Often used for calorie reduction in beverages or desserts. Follow package instructions for substitution.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Other Natural Alternatives**\n   - **Brown Rice Syrup**: A sticky, malt-flavored syrup used in granolas or desserts. Substitute 1 ¼ cups of brown rice syrup for every cup of sugar.\n   - **Barley Malt Syrup**: A thick, dark syrup with a distinct flavor. It can replace sugar but might require recipe adjustments due to its strong taste.\n   - **Yacon Syrup**: Made from the root of the yacon plant, it’s similar in texture to molasses and has a mild sweetness.\n\n---\n\n### General Tips for Substituting Sugar:\n- **Adjust Liquids:** Many liquid sweeteners (like honey or maple syrup) require reducing the liquid in the recipe to maintain texture.\n- **Baking Powder Adjustment:** If replacing sugar with an acidic sweetener (e.g., honey or molasses), you might need to add a little baking soda to neutralize acidity.\n- **Flavor Changes:** Some substitutes, like molasses or coconut sugar, have distinct flavors that can influence the taste of your recipe.\n- **Browning:** Sugar contributes to caramelization and browning in baked goods. Some alternatives may yield lighter-colored results.\n\nBy trying out different substitutes, you can find what works best for your recipes!",

## Remarks

You can skip the `ConvertTo-Json` step if you want to see the raw output. 

```powershell
./quickstart.ps1
```

The output looks like this:

```shell
choices               : {@{content_filter_results=; finish_reason=stop; index=0; logprobs=; message=}}
created               : 1742602727
id                    : chatcmpl-BDgrX0BF38mZuszFeyU1NKZSiRpSX
model                 : gpt-4o-2024-11-20
object                : chat.completion
prompt_filter_results : {@{prompt_index=0; content_filter_results=}}
system_fingerprint    : fp_b705f0c291
usage                 : @{completion_tokens=944; completion_tokens_details=; prompt_tokens=60; prompt_tokens_details=; total_tokens=1004}
```

You can edit the contents of the *powershell.ps1* script to return the entire object or a specific property. For example, to return the text returned, you can replace the last line of the script (`return $response`) with the following:

```powershell
return $response.choices.message.content
```

Then run the script again. 

```powershell
./quickstart.ps1
```

The output looks like this:

### Understanding the message structure

The GPT-4 models are optimized to work with inputs formatted as a conversation. The `messages` variable passes an array of dictionaries with different roles in the conversation delineated by system, user, and assistant. The system message can be used to prime the model by including context or instructions on how the model should respond.

The [GPT-4 how-to guide](../how-to/chatgpt.md) provides an in-depth introduction into the options for communicating with these models.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure portal](../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure PowerShell](../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azpowershell#clean-up-resources)
