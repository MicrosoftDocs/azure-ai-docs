[Source code](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai/samples)

> [!NOTE]
> This guide uses the [latest OpenAI npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) which now fully supports Azure OpenAI. If you're looking for code examples for the legacy Azure OpenAI JavaScript SDK, they're currently still [available in this repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai/samples/v2-beta/javascript).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) used for passwordless authentication in a local development environment, create the necessary context by signing in with the Azure CLI.
- An Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry Models resource with a `gpt-4` series model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

### Microsoft Entra ID prerequisites

For the recommended keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to:
- Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) used for keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Assign the `Cognitive Services User` role to your user account. You can assign roles in the Azure portal under **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**.

## Set up
 
1. Create a new folder `chat-quickstart` and go to the quickstart folder with the following command:

    ```shell
    mkdir chat-quickstart && cd chat-quickstart
    ```

1. Create the `package.json` with the following command:

    ```shell
    npm init -y
    ```   

1. Install the OpenAI client library for JavaScript with:

    ```console
    npm install openai
    ```

1. For the **recommended** passwordless authentication:

    ```console
    npm install @azure/identity
    ```

## Retrieve resource information

[!INCLUDE [resource authentication](resource-authentication.md)]

> [!CAUTION]
> To use the recommended keyless authentication with the SDK, make sure that the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable isn't set. 

## Create a sample application

## [Microsoft Entra ID](#tab/keyless)

1. Create the `index.js` file with the following code:
    
    ```javascript
    const { AzureOpenAI } = require("openai");
    const { 
      DefaultAzureCredential, 
      getBearerTokenProvider 
    } = require("@azure/identity");
    
    // You will need to set these environment variables or edit the following values
    const endpoint = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT || "Your endpoint";
    const apiVersion = process.env.OPENAI_API_VERSION || "2024-05-01-preview";
    const deployment = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME || "gpt-4o"; //This must match your deployment name.
    
    // keyless authentication    
    const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
    const scope = "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default";
    const azureADTokenProvider = getBearerTokenProvider(credential, scope);
    
    async function main() {
    
      const client = new AzureOpenAI({ endpoint, apiKey, azureADTokenProvider, deployment });
      const result = await client.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: "Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?" },
        { role: "assistant", content: "Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI?" },
        { role: "user", content: "Do other Azure services support this too?" },
        ],
        model: "",
      });
    
      for (const choice of result.choices) {
        console.log(choice.message);
      }
    }
    
    main().catch((err) => {
      console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
    });
    
    module.exports = { main };
    ```

1. Sign in to Azure with the following command:

    ```shell
    az login
    ```

1. Run the JavaScript file.

    ```shell
    node index.js
    ```


## [API key](#tab/api-key)

1. Create the `index.js` file with the following code:
    
    ```javascript
    const { AzureOpenAI } = require("openai");
    
    // You will need to set these environment variables or edit the following values
    const endpoint = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT || "Your endpoint";
    const apiKey = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY || "Your API key";
    const apiVersion = process.env.OPENAI_API_VERSION || "2024-05-01-preview";
    const deployment = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME || "gpt-4o"; //This must match your deployment name.
    
    async function main() {
    
      const client = new AzureOpenAI({ endpoint, apiKey, apiVersion, deployment });
      const result = await client.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: "Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?" },
        { role: "assistant", content: "Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI?" },
        { role: "user", content: "Do other Azure services support this too?" },
        ],
        model: "",
      });
    
      for (const choice of result.choices) {
        console.log(choice.message);
      }
    }
    
    main().catch((err) => {
      console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
    });
    
    module.exports = { main };
    ```
    
1. Run the JavaScript file.

    ```shell
    node index.js
    ```

## Output

```output
== Chat Completions Sample ==
{
  content: 'Yes, several other Azure services also support customer managed keys for enhanced security and control over encryption keys.',
  role: 'assistant'
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your receive the error: *Error occurred: OpenAIError: The `apiKey` and `azureADTokenProvider` arguments are mutually exclusive; only one can be passed at a time.* You might need to remove a preexisting environment variable for the API key from your system. Even though the Microsoft Entra ID code sample isn't explicitly referencing the API key environment variable, if one is present on the system executing this sample, this error is still generated.


## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure portal](../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
