In this quickstart, you generate video clips using the Azure OpenAI service. The example uses the Sora model, which is a video generation model that creates realistic and imaginative video scenes from text instructions and/or image or video inputs. This guide shows you how to create a video generation job, poll for its status, and retrieve the generated video.

For more information on video generation, see [Video generation concepts](../concepts/video-generation.md).
