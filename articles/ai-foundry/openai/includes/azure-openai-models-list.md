Azure OpenAI is powered by a diverse set of models with different capabilities and price points. Model availability varies by region and cloud. For Azure Government model availability, refer to [Azure OpenAI in Azure Government](../azure-government.md).

| Models | Description |
|--|--|
| [GPT-5.2 series](../concepts/models.md#gpt-52) | **NEW** `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-chat` (**Preview**)|
| [GPT-5.1 series](../concepts/models.md#gpt-51) | **NEW** `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-chat`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`|
| [Sora](/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure?pivots=azure-openai&tabs=global-standard-aoai%2Cstandard-chat-completions%2Cglobal-standard#video-generation-models) | **NEW** sora-2 |
| [GPT-5 series](../concepts/models.md#gpt-5) | gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-chat |
| [gpt-oss](../concepts/models.md#gpt-oss) | open-weight reasoning models |
| [codex-mini](../concepts/models.md#o-series-models) | Fine-tuned version of o4-mini. |  
| [GPT-4.1 series](../concepts/models.md#gpt-41-series) | gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano |
| [computer-use-preview](../concepts/models.md#computer-use-preview) | An experimental model trained for use with the Responses API computer use tool. |
| [o-series models](../concepts/models.md#o-series-models) |[Reasoning models](../how-to/reasoning.md) with advanced problem solving and increased focus and capability. |
| [GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4 Turbo](../concepts/models.md#gpt-4o-and-gpt-4-turbo) | Capable Azure OpenAI models with multimodal versions, which can accept both text and images as input. |
| [Embeddings](../concepts/models.md#embeddings) | A set of models that can convert text into numerical vector form to facilitate text similarity. |
| [Image generation](../concepts/models.md#image-generation-models) | A series of models that can generate original images from natural language. |
| [`Video generation`](../concepts/models.md#video-generation-models) | A model that can generate original video scenes from text instructions. |
| [Audio](../concepts/models.md#audio-models) | A series of models for speech to text, translation, and text to speech. GPT-4o audio models support either low latency *speech in, speech out* conversational interactions or audio generation. |
