Azure OpenAI is powered by a diverse set of models with different capabilities and price points. Model availability varies by region and cloud. For Azure Government model availability, refer to [Azure OpenAI in Azure Government](../azure-government.md).

| [GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4 Turbo](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure.md#gpt-4o-and-gpt-4-turbo) | Capable Azure OpenAI models with multimodal versions, which can accept both text and images as input. |
| [Embeddings](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure.md#embeddings) | A set of models that can convert text into numerical vector form to facilitate text similarity. |
| [Image generation](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure.md#image-generation-models) | A series of models that can generate original images from natural language. |
| [`Video generation`](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure.md#video-generation-models) | A model that can generate original video scenes from text instructions. |
| [Audio](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure.md#audio-models) | A series of models for speech to text, translation, and text to speech. GPT-4o audio models support either low latency *speech in, speech out* conversational interactions or audio generation. |
