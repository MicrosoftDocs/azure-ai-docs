Larger context windows are compatible with *some* of the underlying models. That means an API call with a larger context succeeds only if the prompt happens to be routed to the right model. Otherwise, the call fails.

## computer-use-preview


An experimental model trained for use with the [Responses API](../how-to/responses.md) computer use tool.

It can be used with third-party libraries to allow the model to control mouse and keyboard input, while getting context from screenshots of the current environment.

> [!CAUTION]
> We don't recommend using preview models in production. We'll upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable, generally available version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

Registration is required to access `computer-use-preview`. Access is granted based on Microsoft's eligibility criteria. Customers who have access to other limited access models still need to request access for this model.

To request access, go to [`computer-use-preview` limited access model application](https://aka.ms/oai/cuaaccess). When access is granted, you need to create a deployment for the model.

## GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo

GPT-4o integrates text and images in a single model, which enables it to handle multiple data types simultaneously. This multimodal approach enhances accuracy and responsiveness in human-computer interactions. GPT-4o matches GPT-4 Turbo in English text and coding tasks while offering superior performance in non-English language tasks and vision tasks, setting new benchmarks for AI capabilities.

### How do I access the GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models?

GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini are available for Standard and Global Standard model deployment.

You need to [create](../how-to/create-resource.md) or use an existing resource in a [supported Standard](#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-model-availability) or [Global Standard](#global-standard-model-availability) region where the model is available.

When your resource is created, you can [deploy](../how-to/create-resource.md#deploy-a-model) the GPT-4o models. If you're performing a programmatic deployment, the model names are:

- `gpt-4o` *version* `2024-11-20`
- `gpt-4o` *version* `2024-08-06`
- `gpt-4o` *version* `2024-05-13`
- `gpt-4o-mini` *version* `2024-07-18`

### GPT-4 Turbo

GPT-4 Turbo is a large multimodal model (accepting text or image inputs and generating text) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of OpenAI's previous models. Like GPT-3.5 Turbo, and older GPT-4 models, GPT-4 Turbo is optimized for chat and works well for traditional completions tasks.

## GPT-4

GPT-4 is the predecessor to GPT-4 Turbo. Both the GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models have a base model name of `gpt-4`. You can distinguish between the GPT-4 and Turbo models by examining the model version.

## GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models

These models can be used only with the Chat Completions API.

See [Model versions](../concepts/model-versions.md) to learn about how Azure OpenAI handles model version upgrades. See [Working with models](../how-to/working-with-models.md) to learn how to view and configure the model version settings of your GPT-4 deployments.

> [!CAUTION]
> We don't recommend that you use preview models in production. We'll upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable, generally available version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

## GPT-3.5

GPT-3.5 models can understand and generate natural language or code. The most capable and cost effective model in the GPT-3.5 family is GPT-3.5 Turbo, which is optimized for chat and also works well for traditional completions tasks. GPT-3.5 Turbo is available for use with the Chat Completions API. GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct has similar capabilities to `text-davinci-003` when you use the Completions API instead of the Chat Completions API. We recommend using GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct over [legacy GPT-3.5 and GPT-3 models](../concepts/legacy-models.md).

|  Model ID   | Description | Max request (tokens) | Training data (up to) |
|  --------- |:---|:------:|:----:|
| `gpt-35-turbo` (0125) *new* |- JSON Mode. <br> - Parallel function calling. <br> - Reproducible output (preview). <br> - Higher accuracy when it responds in requested formats. <br> - Includes a fix for a bug that caused a text-encoding issue for non-English language function calls.  | Input: 16,385<br> Output: 4,096  | Sep 2021 |
| `gpt-35-turbo` (1106) | Older generally available model. <br> - JSON Mode. <br> - Parallel function calling. <br> - Reproducible output (preview). | Input: 16,385<br> Output: 4,096 |  Sep 2021|
| `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` (0914) | *Completions endpoint only*. <br> - Replacement for [legacy completions models](../concepts/legacy-models.md). | 4,097 |Sep 2021 |

## Embeddings

 `text-embedding-3-large` is the latest and most capable embedding model. You can't upgrade between embeddings models. To move from using `text-embedding-ada-002` to `text-embedding-3-large`, you need to generate new embeddings.

- `text-embedding-3-large`
- `text-embedding-3-small`
- `text-embedding-ada-002`

OpenAI reports that testing shows that both the large and small third generation embeddings models offer better average multi-language retrieval performance with the [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl) benchmark. They still maintain performance for English tasks with the [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) benchmark.

|Evaluation benchmark| `text-embedding-ada-002` | `text-embedding-3-small` |`text-embedding-3-large` |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIRACL average | 31.4 | 44.0 | 54.9 |
| MTEB average | 61.0 | 62.3 | 64.6 |

The third generation embeddings models support reducing the size of the embedding via a new `dimensions` parameter. Typically, larger embeddings are more expensive from a compute, memory, and storage perspective. When you can adjust the number of dimensions, you gain more control over overall cost and performance. The `dimensions` parameter isn't supported in all versions of the OpenAI 1.x Python library. To take advantage of this parameter, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version: `pip install openai --upgrade`.

OpenAI's MTEB benchmark testing found that even when the third generation model's dimensions are reduced to less than the 1,536 dimensions of `text-embeddings-ada-002`, performance remains slightly better.

## Image generation models

The image generation models generate images from text prompts that the user provides. GPT-image-1 series models are in limited access preview. DALL-E 3 is generally available for use with the REST APIs. DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 with client SDKs are in preview.

Registration is required to access `gpt-image-1` or `gpt-image-1-mini`. Access is granted based on Microsoft's eligibility criteria. Customers who have access to other limited access models still need to request access for this model.

To request access, go to [`gpt-image-1` limited access model application](https://aka.ms/oai/gptimage1access). When access is granted, you need to create a deployment for the model.

## Audio models

Audio models in Azure OpenAI are available via the `realtime`, `completions`, and `audio` APIs.

### GPT-4o audio models

The GPT-4o audio models are part of the GPT-4o model family and support either low-latency, *speech in, speech out* conversational interactions or audio generation.

> [!CAUTION]
> We don't recommend using preview models in production. We'll upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable, generally available version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

Details about maximum request tokens and training data are available in the following table:

## Model summary table and region availability

### Models by deployment type

Azure OpenAI provides customers with choices on the hosting structure that fits their business and usage patterns. The service offers two main types of deployment:

- **Standard**: Has a global deployment option, routing traffic globally to provide higher throughput.
- **Provisioned**: Also has a global deployment option, allowing customers to purchase and deploy provisioned throughput units across Azure global infrastructure.

All deployments can perform the exact same inference operations, but the billing, scale, and performance are substantially different. To learn more about Azure OpenAI deployment types, see our [Deployment types guide](../../foundry-models/concepts/deployment-types.md).
