<sup>1</sup> For some models, the launch date is used as the value of the model version.

We notify all customers with these preview deployments at least 30 days before the start of the upgrades. We publish an upgrade schedule that details the order of regions and model versions that we follow during the upgrades, and link to that schedule from here.

> [!TIP]
> Will a model upgrade happen if the new model version isn't yet available in that region?
>
> Yes, even in cases where the latest model version isn't yet available in a region, we automatically upgrade deployments during the scheduled upgrade window. For more information, see [Azure OpenAI model versions](/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/model-versions#will-a-model-upgrade-happen-if-the-new-model-version-is-not-yet-available-in-that-region).

## Fine-tuned models

Fine-tuned models retire in two phases: *training* and *deployment*.

All fine-tuned models follow their equivalent base model for *training* retirement. After a model is retired, it's no longer available for fine-tuning.

For fine-tuned models made generally available since `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, *deployment* retirement occurs 1 year after *training* retirement. At deployment retirement, inference and deployment return error responses.

| Model            | Version     | Training retirement date  | Deployment retirement date       |

| `gpt-35-turbo`   | 1106        | At base model retirement  | At training retirement           |
| `gpt-35-turbo`   | 0125        | At base model retirement  | At training retirement           |
| `gpt-4o`         | 2024-08-06  | At base model retirement  | One year after training retirement |
| `gpt-4o-mini`    | 2024-07-18  | At base model retirement  | One year after training retirement |
| `gpt-4.1`        | 2025-04-14  | At base model retirement  | One year after training retirement |
| `gpt-4.1-mini`   | 2025-04-14  | At base model retirement  | One year after training retirement |
| `gpt-4.1-nano`   | 2025-04-14  | At base model retirement  | One year after training retirement |
| `o4-mini`        | 2025-04-16  | At base model retirement  | One year after training retirement |
