## Completions

```HTTP
POST https://{endpoint}/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/completions?api-version=2024-10-21
```

Creates a completion for the provided prompt, parameters, and chosen model.

### URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
|------|------|----------|------|-----------|
| endpoint | path | Yes | string<br>url | Supported Azure OpenAI endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: `https://aoairesource.openai.azure.com`. Replace "aoairesource" with your Azure OpenAI resource name). https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com |
| deployment-id | path | Yes | string | Deployment ID of the model which was deployed. |
| api-version | query | Yes | string | API version |

### Request Header

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|api-key | True | string | Provide Azure OpenAI API key here|

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: application/json

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| prompt | string or array | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.<br><br>Note that <&#124;endoftext&#124;> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt isn't specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.<br> | Yes |  |
| best_of | integer | Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed.<br><br>When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.<br><br>**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.<br> | No | 1 |
| echo | boolean | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion<br> | No | False |
| frequency_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.<br> | No | 0 |
| logit_bias | object | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.<br><br>Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.<br><br>As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <&#124;endoftext&#124;> token from being generated.<br> | No | None |
| logprobs | integer | Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the five most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.<br><br>The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.<br> | No | None |
| max_tokens | integer | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the completion.<br><br>The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length. | No | 16 |
| n | integer | How many completions to generate for each prompt.<br><br>**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.<br> | No | 1 |
| presence_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.<br> | No | 0 |
| seed | integer | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.<br><br>Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.<br> | No |  |
| stop | string or array | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence.<br> | No |  |
| stream | boolean | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. | No | False |
| suffix | string | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.<br><br>This parameter is only supported for `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`.<br> | No | None |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.<br> | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.<br> | No | 1 |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help to monitor and detect abuse.<br> | No |  |

Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.<br> | No |  |
| seed | integer | This feature is in Beta.<br>If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.<br>Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.<br> | No |  |

| tool_choice | [chatCompletionToolChoiceOption](#chatcompletiontoolchoiceoption) | Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model won't call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool. `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present. | No |  |

Be sure ye get a sturdy cage, at least double the size of the bird's wingspan, with enough space to spread their wings, yarrrr!\n\n2. Perches 'n toys: Aye, parrots need perches of different sizes, shapes, 'n textures to keep their feet healthy. Also, a few toys be helpin' to keep them entertained 'n their minds stimulated, arrrh!\n\n3. Proper grub: Feed yer feathered friend a balanced diet of high-quality pellets, fruits, 'n veggies to keep 'em strong 'n healthy. Give 'em fresh water every day, or ye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a scurvy bird on yer hands!\n\n4. Cleanliness: Swab their cage deck!

Be watchful for signs of sickness, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, puffin' up, or change in droppings, and make haste to a vet if need be.\n\n8. Provide fresh air 'n avoid toxins: Parrots be sensitive to draft and pollutants. Keep yer quarters well ventilated, but no drafts, arrr! Be mindful of toxins like Teflon fumes, candles, or air fresheners.\n\nSo there ye have it, me hearty! With proper care 'n commitment, yer parrot will be squawkin' \"Yo-ho-ho\" for many years to come! Good luck, sailor, and may the wind be at yer back!"

### chatCompletionsRequestCommon



| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br>We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br>We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. | No | 1 |
| stream | boolean | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. | No | False |
| stop | string or array | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. | No |  |
| max_tokens | integer | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens). This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and isn't compatible with o1 series models. | No | 4096 |
| max_completion_tokens | integer | An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens. | No |  |
| presence_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. | No | 0 |
| frequency_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. | No | 0 |
| logit_bias | object | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. | No |  |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help Azure OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. | No |  |


### createCompletionRequest



| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| prompt | string or array | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.<br><br>Note that <&#124;endoftext&#124;> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt isn't specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.<br> | Yes |  |
| best_of | integer | Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed.<br><br>When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.<br><br>**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota.

Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.<br><br>As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <&#124;endoftext&#124;> token from being generated.<br> | No | None |
| logprobs | integer | Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens.

| presence_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.<br> | No | 0 |
| seed | integer | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.<br><br>Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.<br> | No |  |
| stop | string or array | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence.<br> | No |  |
| stream | boolean | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.  | No | False |
| suffix | string | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.<br><br>This parameter is only supported for `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`.<br> | No | None |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.<br> | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
