### Environment variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

[!INCLUDE [Azure key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-services/security/azure-key-vault.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Spring AI defaults the model name to `gpt-35-turbo`. It's only necessary to provide the `SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL` value if you've deployed a model with a different name.

```bash
export SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
export SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
export SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MODEL_NAME_HERE"
```
