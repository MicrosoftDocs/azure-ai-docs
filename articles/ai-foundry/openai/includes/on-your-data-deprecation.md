> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure OpenAI On Your Data is deprecated and approaching retirement.
> 
> Microsoft has stopped onboarding new models to Azure OpenAI On Your Data. This feature only supports the following models:
>
> + GPT‑4o (versions 2024‑05‑13, 2024‑08‑06, and 2024‑11‑20)
> + GPT-4o-mini (version 2024-07-18)
> + GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, and GPT-4.1-nano (version 2025-04-14)
>
> [Once the GPT‑4.1 models retire](../concepts/model-retirements.md#current-models), all Azure OpenAI On Your Data API endpoints and supported data source connectors stop functioning.
> 
> We recommend that you migrate Azure OpenAI On Your Data workloads to [Foundry Agent Service](../../agents/overview.md) with [Foundry IQ](../../default/agents/concepts/what-is-foundry-iq.md?view=foundry&preserve-view=true) to retrieve content and generate grounded answers from your data. To get started, see [Connect a Foundry IQ knowledge base](../../default/agents/how-to/foundry-iq-connect.md).
