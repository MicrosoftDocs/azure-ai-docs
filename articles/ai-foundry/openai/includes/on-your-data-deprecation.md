> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure OpenAI On Your Data is deprecated and approaching retirement.
 
> Microsoft has stopped onboarding new models to Azure OpenAI On Your Data. This feature only supports the following GPT‑4o model versions:
> * GPT‑4o (2024‑05‑13)
> * GPT‑4o (2024‑08‑06)
> * GPT‑4o (2024‑11‑20)
> After June 5, 2026, all Azure OpenAI On Your Data API endpoints and supported data source connectors, stop functioning.
> 
> We recommend that you migrate Azure OpenAI On Your Data workloads to [Foundry Agent Service](../../agents/overview.md?view=foundry&preserve-view=true) with [Foundry IQ](../../default/agents/concepts/what-is-foundry-iq.md?view=foundry&preserve-view=true) to retrieve content and generate grounded answers from your data. To get started, see [Connect a Foundry IQ knowledge base](../../default/agents/how-to/foundry-iq-connect.md?view=foundry&preserve-view=true).
