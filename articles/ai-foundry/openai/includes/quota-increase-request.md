You can request quota increases for [Foundry Models sold directly by Azure](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure.md), including Azure OpenAI models. Quota increases aren't generally available for [Models from partners and community](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-from-partners.md). Anthropic models are an exception.

Submit the [quota increase request form](https://aka.ms/oai/stuquotarequest) to request a quota increase. Requests are processed in the order received. Priority goes to customers who actively consume their existing quota allocation. Requests that don't meet this condition might be denied.

For other rate limit increases, [submit a service request](../../../ai-services/cognitive-services-support-options.md?context=/azure/ai-foundry/openai/context/context).
