Quota increase requests can be submitted via the [quota increase request form](https://aka.ms/oai/stuquotarequest). Due to high demand, quota increase requests are accepted and filled in the order they're received. Priority is given to customers who generate traffic that consumes the existing quota allocation. Your request might be denied if this condition isn't met.

You can [submit a service request](../../../ai-services/cognitive-services-support-options.md?context=/azure/ai-foundry/openai/context/context) for other rate limits.
