# API versions in Azure AI Search

Azure AI Search rolls out feature updates regularly. Sometimes, but not always, these updates require a new version of the API to preserve backward compatibility. Publishing a new version allows you to control when and how you integrate search service updates in your code.

As a rule, the REST APIs and libraries are versioned only when necessary, since it can involve some effort to upgrade your code to use a new API version. A new version is needed only if some aspect of the API has changed in a way that breaks backward compatibility. Such changes can happen because of fixes to existing features, or because of new features that change existing API surface area.

See [Azure SDK lifecycle and support policy](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_support.html) for more information about the deprecation path.

## Deprecated versions

**2023-07-01-preview** was deprecated on April 8, 2024 and won't be supported after July 8, 2024.

This was the first REST API that offered vector search support. Newer API versions have a different vector configuration. You should [migrate to a newer version](search-api-migration.md) as soon as possible.

## Discontinued versions

Some API versions are discontinued and are rejected by a search service:

+ **2015-02-28**
+ **2015-02-28-Preview**
+ **2014-07-31-Preview**
+ **2014-10-20-Preview**

All SDKs are based on REST API versions. If a REST version is discontinued, SDK packages based on that version are also discontinued. All Azure AI Search .NET SDKs older than [**3.0.0-rc**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Search/3.0.0-rc) are now obsolete. 

Support for the above-listed versions ended on October 15, 2020. If you have code that uses a discontinued version, you can [migrate existing code](search-api-migration.md) to a newer [REST API version](/rest/api/searchservice/) or to a newer Azure SDK.
