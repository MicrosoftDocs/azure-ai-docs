# Update or rebuild an index in Azure AI Search

This article explains how to update an existing index in Azure AI Search with schema changes or content changes through incremental indexing. It explains the circumstances under which rebuilds are required, and provides recommendations for mitigating the effects of rebuilds on ongoing query requests.

During active development, it's common to drop and rebuild indexes when you're iterating over index design. Most developers work with a small representative sample of their data so that reindexing goes faster.

For schema changes on applications already in production, we recommend creating and testing a new index that runs side by side an existing index. Use an [index alias](search-how-to-alias.md) to swap in the new index while avoiding changes your application code.

## Update content

Incremental indexing and synchronizing an index against changes in source data is fundamental to most search applications. This section explains the workflow for updating field contents in a search index.

1. Use the same techniques for loading documents: [Documents - Index (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents) or an equivalent API in the Azure SDKs. For more information about indexing techniques, see [Load documents](search-how-to-load-search-index.md).

1. Set the `@search.action` parameter to determine the effect on existing documents:

   | Action | Effect |
   |--------|--------|
   | delete | Removes the entire document from the index. If you want to remove an individual field, use merge instead, setting the field in question to null. Deleted documents and fields don't immediately free up space in the index. Every few minutes, a background process performs the physical deletion. Whether you use the Azure portal or an API to return index statistics, you can expect a small delay before the deletion is reflected in the Azure portal and through APIs. |
   | merge | Updates a document that already exists, and fails a document that can't be found. Merge replaces existing values. For this reason, be sure to check for collection fields that contain multiple values, such as fields of type `Collection(Edm.String)`. For example, if a `tags` field starts with a value of `["budget"]` and you execute a merge with `["economy", "pool"]`, the final value of the `tags` field is `["economy", "pool"]`. It won't be `["budget", "economy", "pool"]`. |
   | mergeOrUpload | Behaves like merge if the document exists, and upload if the document is new. This is the most common action for incremental updates. |
   | upload | Similar to an "upsert" where the document is inserted if it's new, and updated or replaced if it exists. If the document is missing values that the index requires, the document field's value is set to null. |

1. Post the update.

Queries continue to run, but if you're updating or removing existing fields, you can expect mixed results and a higher incidence of throttling.

## Tips for incremental indexing

+ [Indexers automate incremental indexing](search-indexer-overview.md). If you can use an indexer, and if the data source supports change tracking, you can run the indexer on a recurring schedule to add, update, or overwrite searchable content so that it's synchronized to your external data.

+ If you're making index calls directly through the [push API](search-what-is-data-import.md#pushing-data-to-an-index), use `mergeOrUpload` as the search action.

+ The payload must include the keys or identifiers of every document you want to add, update, or delete.

+ If your index includes vector fields and you set the [`stored` property to false](vector-search-how-to-storage-options.md), make sure you provide the vector in your partial document update, even if the value is unchanged. A side effect of setting `stored` to false is that vectors are dropped on a reindexing operation. Providing the vector in the documents payload prevents this from happening.

+ To update the contents of simple fields and subfields in complex types, list only the fields you want to change. For example, if you only need to update a description field, the payload should consist of the document key and the modified description. Omitting other fields retains their existing values.

+ To merge inline changes into string collection, provide the entire value. Recall the `tags` field example from the previous section. New values overwrite the old values for an entire field, and there's no merging within the content of a field.

Here's a [REST API example](search-get-started-rest.md) demonstrating these tips:

```rest
### Get Stay-Kay City Hotel by ID
GET  {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-vector-quickstart/docs('1')?api-version=2024-07-01  HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: {{apiKey}}

### Change the description, city, and tags for Stay-Kay City Hotel
POST {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-vector-quickstart/docs/search.index?api-version=2024-07-01  HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json
  api-key: {{apiKey}}

    {
        "value": [
            {
            "@search.action": "mergeOrUpload",
            "HotelId": "1",
            "Description": "I'm overwriting the description for Stay-Kay City Hotel.",
            "Tags": ["my old item", "my new item"],
            "Address": {
                "City": "Gotham City"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
       
### Retrieve the same document, confirm the overwrites and retention of all other values
GET  {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-vector-quickstart/docs('1')?api-version=2024-07-01  HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: {{apiKey}}
```

## Change an index schema

The index schema defines the physical data structures created on the search service, so there aren't many schema changes that you can make without incurring a full rebuild. The following list enumerates the schema changes that can be introduced seamlessly into an existing index. Generally, the list includes new fields and functionality used during query execution.

+ Add a new field
+ Set the `retrievable` attribute on an existing field
+ Update `searchAnalyzer` on a field having an existing `indexAnalyzer`
+ Add a new analyzer definition in an index (which can be applied to new fields)
+ Add, update, or delete scoring profiles
+ Add, update, or delete CORS settings
+ Add, update, or delete synonymMaps
+ Add, update, or delete semantic configurations

The order of operations is:

1. [Get the index definition](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/get).

1. Revise the schema with updates from the previous list.

1. [Update index schema](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) on the search service.

1. [Update index content](#update-content) to match your revised schema if you added a new field. For all other changes, the existing indexed content is used as-is.

When you update an index schema to include a new field, existing documents in the index are given a null value for that field. On the next indexing job, values from external source data replace the nulls added by Azure AI Search.

There should be no query disruptions during the updates, but query results will vary as the updates take effect.

## Drop and rebuild an index

Some modifications require an index drop and rebuild, replacing a current index with a new one.

| Action | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Delete a field | To physically remove all traces of a field, you have to rebuild the index. When an immediate rebuild isn't practical, you can modify application code to redirect access away from an obsolete field or use the [searchFields](search-query-create.md#example-of-a-full-text-query-request) and [select](search-query-odata-select.md) query parameters to choose which fields are searched and returned. Physically, the field definition and contents remain in the index until the next rebuild, when you apply a schema that omits the field in question. |
| Change a field definition | Revisions to a field name, data type, or specific [index attributes](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create) (searchable, filterable, sortable, facetable) require a full rebuild. |
| Assign an analyzer to a field | [Analyzers](search-analyzers.md) are defined in an index, assigned to fields, and then invoked during indexing to inform how tokens are created. You can add a new analyzer definition to an index at any time, but you can only *assign* an analyzer when the field is created. This is true for both the **analyzer** and **indexAnalyzer** properties. The **searchAnalyzer** property is an exception (you can assign this property to an existing field). |
| Update or delete an analyzer definition in an index | You can't delete or change an existing analyzer configuration (analyzer, tokenizer, token filter, or char filter) in the index unless you rebuild the entire index. |
| Add a field to a suggester | If a field already exists and you want to add it to a [Suggesters](index-add-suggesters.md) construct, rebuild the index. |
| Switch tiers | In-place upgrades aren't supported. If you require more capacity, create a new service and rebuild your indexes from scratch. To help automate this process, you can use the **index-backup-restore** sample code in this [Azure AI Search .NET sample repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-utilities). This app backs up your index to a series of JSON files, and then recreate the index in a search service you specify.|

The order of operations is:

1. [Get an index definition](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/get) in case you need it for future reference, or to use as the basis for a new version.

1. Consider using a backup and restore solution to preserve a copy of index content. There are solutions in [C#](https://github.com/liamca/azure-search-backup-restore/blob/master/README.md) and in [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-python/code/index-backup-restore). We recommend the Python version because it's more up to date.

   If you have capacity on your search service, keep the existing index while creating and testing the new one.

1. [Drop the existing index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/delete). Queries targeting the index are immediately dropped. Remember that deleting an index is irreversible, destroying physical storage for the fields collection and other constructs. 

1. [Post a revised index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create), where the body of the request includes changed or modified field definitions and configurations.

1. [Load the index with documents](/rest/api/searchservice/documents) from an external source. Documents are indexed using the field definitions and configurations of the new schema.

When you create the index, physical storage is allocated for each field in the index schema, with an inverted index created for each searchable field and a vector index created for each vector field. Fields that aren't searchable can be used in filters or expressions, but don't have inverted indexes and aren't full-text or fuzzy searchable. On an index rebuild, these inverted indexes and vector indexes are deleted and recreated based on the index schema you provide.

## Balancing workloads

Indexing doesn't run in the background, but the search service will balance any indexing jobs against ongoing queries. During indexing, you can [monitor query requests](search-monitor-queries.md) in the Azure portal to ensure queries are completing in a timely manner.

If indexing workloads introduce unacceptable levels of query latency, conduct [performance analysis](search-performance-analysis.md) and review these [performance tips](search-performance-tips.md) for potential mitigation.

## Check for updates

You can begin querying an index as soon as the first document is loaded. If you know a document's ID, the [Lookup Document REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/get) returns the specific document. For broader testing, you should wait until the index is fully loaded, and then use queries to verify the context you expect to see.

You can use [Search Explorer](search-explorer.md) or a [REST client](search-get-started-rest.md) to check for updated content.

If you added or renamed a field, use [$select](search-query-odata-select.md) to return that field: `search=*&$select=document-id,my-new-field,some-old-field&$count=true`.

The Azure portal provides index size and vector index size. You can check these values after updating an index, but remember to expect a small delay as the service processes the change and to account for portal refresh rates, which can be a few minutes.

## Delete orphan documents

Azure AI Search supports document-level operations so that you can look up, update, and delete a specific document in isolation. The following example shows how to delete a document. 

Deleting a document doesn't immediately free up space in the index. Every few minutes, a background process performs the physical deletion. Whether you use the Azure portal or an API to return index statistics, you can expect a small delay before the deletion is reflected in the Azure portal and API metrics.

1. Identify which field is the document key. In the Azure portal, you can view the fields of each index. Document keys are string fields and are denoted with a key icon to make them easier to spot.

1. Check the values of the document key field: `search=*&$select=HotelId`. A simple string is straightforward, but if the index uses a base-64 encoded field, or if search documents were generated from a `parsingMode` setting, you might be working with values that you aren't familiar with.

1. [Look up the document](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/get) to verify the value of the document ID and to review its content before deleting it. Specify the key or document ID in the request. The following examples illustrate a simple string for the [Hotels sample index](search-get-started-portal.md) and a base-64 encoded string for the metadata_storage_path key of the [cog-search-demo index](cognitive-search-tutorial-blob.md).

    ```http
    GET https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/hotel-sample-index/docs/1111?api-version=2024-07-01
    ```

    ```http
    GET https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/cog-search-demo/docs/aHR0cHM6Ly9oZWlkaWJsb2JzdG9yYWdlMi5ibG9iLmNvcmUud2luZG93cy5uZXQvY29nLXNlYXJjaC1kZW1vL2d1dGhyaWUuanBn0?api-version=2024-07-01
    ```

1. [Delete the document](/rest/api/searchservice/documents) using a delete `@search.action` to remove it from the search index.

    ```http
    POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-sample-index/docs/index?api-version=2024-07-01
    Content-Type: application/json   
    api-key: [admin key] 
    {  
      "value": [  
        {  
          "@search.action": "delete",  
          "id": "1111"  
        }  
      ]  
    }
    ```
