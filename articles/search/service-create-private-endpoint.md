# Create a private endpoint for a secure connection to Azure AI Search

This article explains how to configure a private connection to Azure AI Search so that it admits requests from clients in a virtual network instead of over a public internet connection:

+ [Create an Azure virtual network](#create-the-virtual-network), or use an existing one
+ [Configure a search service to use a private endpoint](#create-a-search-service-with-a-private-endpoint)
+ [Create an Azure virtual machine in the same virtual network](#create-a-virtual-machine)
+ [Test using a browser session on the virtual machine](#connect-to-the-vm)

Other Azure resources that might privately connect to Azure AI Search include Azure OpenAI for "use your own data" scenarios. Azure AI Foundry doesn't run in a virtual network, but it can be configured on the backend to send requests over the Microsoft backbone network. Configuration for this traffic pattern is enabled by Microsoft when your request is submitted and approved. For this scenario:

+ Follow the instructions in this article to set up the private endpoint.
+ [Enable trusted service](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/use-your-data-securely#enable-trusted-service-1) of your search resource from the Azure portal.
+ Optionally, [disable public network access](#disable-public-network-access) if connections should only originate from clients in virtual network or from Azure OpenAI over a private endpoint connection.

## Key points about private endpoints

Private endpoints are provided by [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview), as a separate billable service. For more information about costs, see [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/).

Once a search service has a private endpoint, portal access to that service must be initiated from a browser session on a virtual machine inside the virtual network. See [this step](#portal-access-private-search-service) for details.

You can create a private endpoint for a search service in the Azure portal, as described in this article. Alternatively, you can use the [Management REST API](/rest/api/searchmanagement/), [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.search), or the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/search).

## Why use a private endpoint?

[Private endpoints](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) for Azure AI Search allow a client on a virtual network to securely access data in a search index over a [Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview). The private endpoint uses an IP address from the [virtual network address space](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/private-ip-addresses) for your search service. Network traffic between the client and the search service traverses over the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet. For a list of other PaaS services that support Private Link, check the [availability section](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview#availability) in the product documentation.

Private endpoints for your search service allow you to:

+ Block all connections on the public endpoint for your search service.
+ Increase security for the virtual network, by letting you block exfiltration of data from the virtual network.
+ Securely connect to your search service from on-premises networks that connect to the virtual network using [VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) or [ExpressRoutes](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-locations) with private-peering.

   > + `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)`

1. Select **Review + create** for a validation check.

1. When you see the **Validation passed** message, select **Create**. 

## Connect to the VM

Download and then connect to the virtual machine as follows:

1. In the Azure portal's search bar, search for the virtual machine created in the previous step.

1. Select **Connect**. After selecting the **Connect** button, **Connect to virtual machine** opens.

1. Select **Download RDP File**. Azure creates a Remote Desktop Protocol (*.rdp*) file and downloads it to your computer.

1. Open the downloaded *.rdp* file.

    1. If prompted, select **Connect**.

    1. Enter the username and password you specified when creating the VM.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You might need to select **More choices** > **Use a different account**, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM.

1. Select **OK**.

1. You might receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. If you receive a certificate warning, select **Yes** or **Continue**.

1. Once the VM desktop appears, minimize it to go back to your local desktop.  

## Test connections

In this section, you verify private network access to the search service and connect privately to the using the Private Endpoint.

When the search service endpoint is private, some portal features are disabled. You can view and manage service level settings, but portal access to index data and various other components in the service, such as the index, indexer, and skillset definitions, is restricted for security reasons.

1. In the Remote Desktop of *myVM*, open PowerShell.

1. Enter `nslookup [search service name].search.windows.net`.

    You'll receive a message similar to this:

    ```
    Server:  UnKnown
    Address:  168.63.129.16
    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:    [search service name].privatelink.search.windows.net
    Address:  10.0.0.5
    Aliases:  [search service name].search.windows.net
    ```

1. From the VM, connect to the search service and create an index. You can follow this [quickstart](search-get-started-rest.md) to create a new search index in your service using the REST API. Setting up requests from a Web API test tool requires the search service endpoint `(https://[search service name].search.windows.net)` and the admin api-key you copied in a previous step.

1. Completing the quickstart from the VM is your confirmation that the service is fully operational.

1. Close the remote desktop connection to *myVM*. 

1. To verify that your service isn't accessible on a public endpoint, open a REST client on your local workstation and attempt the first several tasks in the quickstart. If you receive an error that the remote server doesn't exist, you successfully configured a private endpoint for your search service.

## Use the Azure portal to access a private search service

When the search service endpoint is private, some portal features are disabled. You can view and manage service level information, but index, indexer, and skillset information are hidden for security reasons. 

To work around this restriction, connect to Azure portal from a browser on a virtual machine inside the virtual network. the Azure portal uses the private endpoint on the connection and gives you visibility into content and operations.

1. Follow the [steps to provision a VM that can access the search service through a private endpoint](#create-virtual-machine-private-endpoint).

1. On a virtual machine in your virtual network, open a browser and sign in to the Azure portal. the Azure portal uses the private endpoint attached to the virtual machine to connect to your search service.

## Disable public network access

You can lock down a search service to prevent it from admitting any request from the public internet. You can use the Azure portal for this step.

1. In the Azure portal, on the leftmost pane of your search service page, select **Networking**.

1. Select **Disabled** on the **Firewalls and virtual networks** tab.

You can also use the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/search/service?view=azure-cli-latest#az-search-service-update&preserve-view=true), [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.search/set-azsearchservice), or the [Management REST API](/rest/api/searchmanagement/), by setting `public-access` or `public-network-access` to `disabled`.

## Clean up resources

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money.

You can delete individual resources or the resource group to delete everything you created in this exercise. Select the resource group on any resource's overview page, and then select **Delete**.

## Next step

In this article, you created a VM on a virtual network and a search service with a private endpoint. You connected to the VM from the internet and securely communicated to the search service using Private Link.
