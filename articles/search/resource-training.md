# Training - Azure AI Search

Training modules deliver an end-to-end experience that helps you build skills and develop insights while working through a progression of exercises. Visit the following links to begin learning with prepared lessons from Microsoft and other training providers.

## Learning paths

Learning paths are a collection of training modules that are organized around specific roles (like developer) or technologies (like Azure AI Search). Azure AI Search is covered in two learning paths.

+ [Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals: Azure Document Intelligence in Foundry Tools and Knowledge Mining](/training/paths/document-intelligence-knowledge-mining/) includes two modules: [Fundamentals of Azure AI Search and knowledge mining](/training/modules/intro-to-azure-search/) and [Fundamentals of Azure Document Intelligence](/training/modules/analyze-receipts-form-recognizer/). Choose this learning path to broaden your understanding of when to use each technology.

+ [Implement knowledge mining with Azure AI Search](/training/paths/implement-knowledge-mining-azure-cognitive-search/) includes eight modules that teach important skills. Choose this learning path to gain expertise in Azure AI Search.
