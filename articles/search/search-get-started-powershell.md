# Quickstart: Create a search index in PowerShell by using REST APIs

In this Azure AI Search quickstart, learn how to create, load, and query a search index by using PowerShell and the [Azure AI Search REST APIs](/rest/api/searchservice/). This article explains how to run PowerShell commands interactively. Alternatively, you can [download and run a PowerShell script](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-powershell-samples/tree/main/Quickstart) that performs the same operations.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

The following services and tools are required for this quickstart:

- [PowerShell 7.3 or later](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), using [Invoke-RestMethod](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Invoke-RestMethod) for sequential and interactive steps.
- [Create an Azure AI Search service](search-create-service-portal.md) or [find an existing service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices) under your current subscription. You can use a free service for this quickstart.

## Copy a search service key and URL

In this quickstart, REST calls include the service URL and an access key on every request. A search service is created with both, so if you added Azure AI Search to your subscription, follow these steps to get the necessary information.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). On your search service **Overview** page, get the URL. An example endpoint might look like `https://mydemo.search.windows.net`.

1. Select **Settings** > **Keys** and then get an admin key for full rights on the service. Two interchangeable admin keys are provided for business continuity if you need to roll one over. You can use either the primary or secondary key on requests for adding, modifying, and deleting objects.

   ![Screenshot that shows getting an HTTP endpoint and access key.](media/search-get-started-rest/get-url-key.png "Get an HTTP endpoint and access key")

All requests require an API key on every request sent to your service. Having a valid key establishes trust, on a per-request basis, between the application sending the request and the service that handles it.

## Connect to Azure AI Search

1. In PowerShell, create a `$headers` object to store the content type and API key. Replace the admin API key (`YOUR-ADMIN-API-KEY`) with a key that's valid for your search service. You only have to set this header once for the duration of the session, but you add it to every request.

    ```powershell
    $headers = @{
    'api-key' = '<YOUR-ADMIN-API-KEY>'
    'Content-Type' = 'application/json' 
    'Accept' = 'application/json' }
    ```

1. Create a `$url` object that specifies the service's indexes collection. Replace the service name (`YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME`) with a valid search service.

    ```powershell
    $url = "https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME>.search.windows.net/indexes?api-version=2024-07-01&`$select=name"
    ```

1. Run `Invoke-RestMethod` to send a GET request to the service and verify the connection. Add `ConvertTo-Json` so that you can view the responses sent back from the service.

    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers | ConvertTo-Json
    ```

   If the service is empty and has no indexes, results are similar to the following example. Otherwise, you see a JSON representation of index definitions.

    ```
    {
        "@odata.context":  "https://mydemo.search.windows.net/$metadata#indexes",
        "value":  [

                ]
    }
    ```

## Create an index

Unless you're using the Azure portal, an index must exist on the service before you can load data. This step defines the index and pushes it to the service. The [Create Index REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create) is used for this step.

Required elements of an index include a name and a fields collection. The fields collection defines the structure of a *document*. Each field has a name, type, and attributes that determine how it's used (for example, whether it's full-text searchable, filterable, or retrievable in search results). Within an index, one of the fields of type `Edm.String` must be designated as the *key* for document identity.

This index is named `hotels-quickstart` and has the field definitions you see in the following code. It's a subset of a larger [Hotels index](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/blob/main/hotels/Hotels_IndexDefinition.JSON) used in other walkthrough articles. The field definitions are trimmed in this quickstart for brevity.

1. Paste this example into PowerShell to create a `$body` object that contains the index schema.

    ```powershell
    $body = @"
    {
        "name": "hotels-quickstart",  
        "fields": [
            {"name": "HotelId", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true, "filterable": true},
            {"name": "HotelName", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": true, "facetable": false},
            {"name": "Description", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "analyzer": "en.lucene"},
            {"name": "Category", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
            {"name": "Tags", "type": "Collection(Edm.String)", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": false, "facetable": true},
            {"name": "ParkingIncluded", "type": "Edm.Boolean", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
            {"name": "LastRenovationDate", "type": "Edm.DateTimeOffset", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
            {"name": "Rating", "type": "Edm.Double", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
            {"name": "Address", "type": "Edm.ComplexType", 
            "fields": [
            {"name": "StreetAddress", "type": "Edm.String", "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "searchable": true},
            {"name": "City", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
            {"name": "StateProvince", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
            {"name": "PostalCode", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
            {"name": "Country", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true}
            ]
         }
      ]
    }
    "@
    ```

1. Set the URI to the indexes collection on your service and the `hotels-quickstart` index.

    ```powershell
    $url = "https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE>.search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-quickstart?api-version=2024-07-01"
    ```

1. Run the command with `$url`, `$headers`, and `$body` to create the index on the service.

    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Method Put -Body $body | ConvertTo-Json
    ```

    Results should look similar to this example, which shows only the first two fields for brevity:

    ```
    {
        "@odata.context":  "https://mydemo.search.windows.net/$metadata#indexes/$entity",
        "@odata.etag":  "\"0x8D6EDE28CFEABDA\"",
        "name":  "hotels-quickstart",
        "defaultScoringProfile":  null,
        "fields":  [
                    {
                        "name":  "HotelId",
                        "type":  "Edm.String",
                        "searchable":  true,
                        "filterable":  true,
                        "retrievable":  true,
                        "sortable":  true,
                        "facetable":  true,
                        "key":  true,
                        "indexAnalyzer":  null,
                        "searchAnalyzer":  null,
                        "analyzer":  null,
                        "synonymMaps":  ""
                    },
                    {
                        "name":  "HotelName",
                        "type":  "Edm.String",
                        "searchable":  true,
                        "filterable":  false,
                        "retrievable":  true,
                        "sortable":  true,
                        "facetable":  false,
                        "key":  false,
                        "indexAnalyzer":  null,
                        "searchAnalyzer":  null,
                        "analyzer":  null,
                        "synonymMaps":  ""
                    },
                    . . .
        ]
    }
    ```

## Load documents

To push documents, use an HTTP POST request to your index's URL endpoint. The REST API for this task is [Index Documents](/rest/api/searchservice/documents).

1. Paste this example into PowerShell to create a `$body` object that contains the documents you want to upload.

    This request includes two full records and one partial record. The partial record demonstrates that you can upload incomplete documents. The `@search.action` parameter specifies how indexing is done. Valid values include `upload`, `merge`, `mergeOrUpload`, and `delete`. The `mergeOrUpload` behavior either creates a new document for `hotelId = 3` or updates the contents if it already exists.

    ```powershell
    $body = @"
    {
        "value": [
        {
        "@search.action": "upload",
        "HotelId": "1",

            "PostalCode": "10022",
            "Country": "USA"
            } 
        },
        {

        "HotelName": "Old Century Hotel",
        "Description": "The hotel is situated in a  nineteenth century plaza, which has been expanded and renovated to the highest architectural standards to create a modern, functional and first-class hotel in which art and unique historical elements coexist with the most modern comforts.",

        "Rating": 3.60,
        "Address": 
            {
            "StreetAddress": "140 University Town Center Dr",
            "City": "Sarasota",
            "StateProvince": "FL",
            "PostalCode": "34243",
            "Country": "USA"
            } 
        },
        {
        "@search.action": "upload",
        "HotelId": "3",
        "HotelName": "Gastronomic Landscape Hotel",

            } 
        },
        {
        "@search.action": "upload",
        "HotelId": "4",
        "HotelName": "Sublime Palace Hotel",
        "Description": "Sublime Palace Hotel is located in the heart of the historic center of Sublime in an extremely vibrant and lively area within short walking distance to the sites and landmarks of the city and is surrounded by the extraordinary beauty of churches, buildings, shops and monuments.

        "Category": "Boutique",
        "Tags": [ "concierge", "view", "24-hour front desk service" ],
        "ParkingIncluded": true,

            "StateProvince": "TX",
            "PostalCode": "78216",
            "Country": "USA"
            }
        }
    ]
    }
    "@
    ```

1. Set the endpoint to the `hotels-quickstart` docs collection and include the index operation (`indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs/index`).

    ```powershell
    $url = "https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE>.search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs/index?api-version=2024-07-01"
    ```

1. Run the command with `$url`, `$headers`, and `$body` to load documents into the `hotels-quickstart` index.

    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $body | ConvertTo-Json
    ```
    Results should look similar to the following example. You should see a [status code of 201](/rest/api/searchservice/HTTP-status-codes).

    ```
    {
        "@odata.context":  "https://mydemo.search.windows.net/indexes(\u0027hotels-quickstart\u0027)/$metadata#Collection(Microsoft.Azure.Search.V2019_05_06.IndexResult)",
        "value":  [
                    {
                        "key":  "1",
                        "status":  true,
                        "errorMessage":  null,
                        "statusCode":  201
                    },
                    {
                        "key":  "2",
                        "status":  true,
                        "errorMessage":  null,
                        "statusCode":  201
                    },
                    {
                        "key":  "3",
                        "status":  true,
                        "errorMessage":  null,
                        "statusCode":  201
                    },
                    {
                        "key":  "4",
                        "status":  true,
                        "errorMessage":  null,
                        "statusCode":  201
                    }
                ]
    }
    ```

## Search an index

This step shows you how to query an index by using the [Search Documents API](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post).

Be sure to use single quotation marks on search `$urls`. Query strings include `$` characters, and you can omit having to escape them if the entire string is enclosed in single quotation marks.

1. Set the endpoint to the `hotels-quickstart` docs collection and add a `search` parameter to pass in a query string.
  
   This string executes an empty search (`search=*`), returning an unranked list (search score = 1.0) of arbitrary documents. By default, Azure AI Search returns 50 matches at a time. As structured, this query returns an entire document structure and values. Add `$count=true` to get a count of all documents in the results.

    ```powershell
    $url = 'https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE>.search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs?api-version=2024-07-01&search=*&$count=true'
    ```

1. Run the command to send the `$url` to the service.

    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers | ConvertTo-Json
    ```

    Results should look similar to the following output:

    ```
    {
    "@odata.context":  "https://mydemo.search.windows.net/indexes(\u0027hotels-quickstart\u0027)/$metadata#docs(*)",
    "@odata.count":  4,
    "value":  [
                  {
                      "@search.score":  0.1547872,
                      "HotelId":  "2",
                      "HotelName":  "Old Century Hotel",
                      "Description":  "The hotel is situated in a  nineteenth century plaza, which has been expanded and renovated to the highest architectural standards to create a modern, functional and first-class hotel in which art and unique historical elements coexist with the most modern comforts.",
                      "Category":  "Boutique",
                      "Tags":  "pool free wifi concierge",
                      "ParkingIncluded":  false,
                      "LastRenovationDate":  "1979-02-18T00:00:00Z",
                      "Rating":  3.6,
                      "Address":  "@{StreetAddress=140 University Town Center Dr; City=Sarasota; StateProvince=FL; PostalCode=34243; Country=USA}"
                  },
                  {
                      "@search.score":  0.009068266,
                      "HotelId":  "3",
                      "HotelName":  "Gastronomic Landscape Hotel",
                      "Description":  "The Hotel stands out for its gastronomic excellence under the management of William Dough, who advises on and oversees all of the Hotel\u0027s restaurant services.",
                      "Category":  "Resort and Spa",
                      "Tags":  "air conditioning bar continental breakfast",
                      "ParkingIncluded":  true,
                      "LastRenovationDate":  "2015-09-20T00:00:00Z",
                      "Rating":  4.8,
                      "Address":  "@{StreetAddress=3393 Peachtree Rd; City=Atlanta; StateProvince=GA; PostalCode=30326; Country=USA}"
                  },
                . . .
        ]
    }
    ```

Try a few other query examples to get a feel for the syntax. You can do a string search, verbatim `$filter` queries, limit the results set, scope the search to specific fields, and more.

```powershell
# Query example 1
# Search the entire index for the terms 'restaurant' and 'wifi'
# Return only the HotelName, Description, and Tags fields
$url = 'https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE>.search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs?api-version=2024-07-01&search=restaurant wifi&$count=true&$select=HotelName,Description,Tags'

# Query example 2 
# Apply a filter to the index to find hotels rated 4 or higher
# Returns the HotelName and Rating. Two documents match.
$url = 'https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE>.search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs?api-version=2024-07-01&search=*&$filter=Rating gt 4&$select=HotelName,Rating'

# Query example 3
# Take the top two results, and show only HotelName and Category in the results
$url = 'https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE>.search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs?api-version=2024-07-01&search=boutique&$top=2&$select=HotelName,Category'

# Query example 4
# Sort by a specific field (Address/City) in ascending order

$url = 'https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE>.search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs?api-version=2024-07-01&search=pool&$orderby=Address/City asc&$select=HotelName, Address/City, Tags, Rating'

## Clean up resources

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can find and manage resources in the Azure portal by using the **All resources** or **Resource groups** link in the leftmost pane.

If you're using a free service, remember that you're limited to three indexes, indexers, and data sources. You can delete individual items in the Azure portal to stay under the limit.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you used PowerShell to step through the basic workflow for creating and accessing content in Azure AI Search. With the concepts in mind, we recommend that you move on to more advanced scenarios, such as indexing from Azure data sources:
