# REST samples for Azure AI Search

Learn about the REST API samples that demonstrate the functionality and workflow of an Azure AI Search solution. These samples use the [**Search REST APIs**](/rest/api/searchservice).

REST is the definitive programming interface for Azure AI Search. All operations that can be invoked programmatically are available first in REST and then in SDKs. For this reason, most examples in the documentation use the REST APIs to demonstrate or explain important concepts.

You can use any client that supports HTTP calls. To learn how to formulate the HTTP request using Visual Studio Code with a REST client, see [Quickstart: Keyword search using REST](search-get-started-rest.md).

## Doc samples

Code samples from the Azure AI Search team demonstrate features and workflows. Many of these samples are referenced in tutorials, quickstarts, and how-to articles. You can find these samples in [**Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples) on GitHub.

| Samples | Description |
|---------|---------|
| [quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/Quickstart) | Source code for [Quickstart: Text search using REST](search-get-started-rest.md). This sample covers the basic workflow for creating, loading, and querying a search index using sample data. |
| [quickstart-vectors](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/Quickstart-vectors) | Source code for [Quickstart: Vector search using REST APIs](search-get-started-vector.md). This sample covers the basic workflow for indexing and querying vector data. |
| [quickstart-agentic-retrieval](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/Quickstart-agentic-retrieval) | Source code for the REST portion of [Quickstart: Run agentic retrieval in Azure AI Search](search-get-started-agentic-retrieval.md). This sample shows you how to create a knowledge agent in Azure AI Search to integrate LLM reasoning into query planning. |
| [skillset-tutorial](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/skillset-tutorial) | Source code for [Tutorial: Use REST and AI to generate searchable content from Azure blobs](cognitive-search-tutorial-blob.md). This sample shows you how to create a skillset that iterates over Azure blobs to extract information and infer structure.|
| [skill examples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/skill-examples) | Skillset examples in indexer pipelines that include indexes and indexers so that you can follow field mappings, output field mappings, and source paths. |
| [debug-sessions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/Debug-sessions) | Source code for [Tutorial: Diagnose, repair, and commit changes to your skillset](cognitive-search-tutorial-debug-sessions.md). This sample shows you how to use a skillset debug session in the Azure portal. REST is used to create the objects used during debug.|
| [custom-analyzers](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/custom-analyzers) | Source code for [Tutorial: Create a custom analyzer for phone numbers](tutorial-create-custom-analyzer.md). This sample explains how to use analyzers to preserve patterns and special characters in searchable content.|
| [index-json-blobs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/index-json-blobs) | Create an indexer, data source, and index for nested JSON within a JSON array. This sample demonstrates the jsonArray parsing model and documentRoot parameters. |
| [knowledge-store](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/knowledge-store) | Source code for [Create a knowledge store using REST](knowledge-store-create-rest.md). This sample explains the necessary steps for populating a knowledge store used for knowledge mining workflows. |
| [projections](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/projections) | Source code for [Define projections in a knowledge store](knowledge-store-projections-examples.md). This sample explains how to specify the physical data structures in a knowledge store.|
