# Preview features in Azure AI Search

This article identifies all data plane and control plane features in public preview. This list is helpful for checking feature status. It also explains how to call a preview REST API.

Preview API versions are cumulative and roll up to the next preview. We recommend always using the latest preview APIs for full access to all preview features.

Preview features are removed from this list if they're retired or transition to general availability. For announcements regarding general availability and retirement, see [Service Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=search) or [What's New](whats-new.md).

## Data plane preview features

## Preview features in Azure SDKs

Each Azure SDK team releases beta packages on their own timeline. Check the change log for mentions of new features in beta packages:

+ [Change log for Azure SDK for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/search/search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md).

## Using preview features

Experimental features are available through the preview REST API first, followed by Azure portal, and then the Azure SDKs. 

The following statements apply to preview features:

+ Preview features are available under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), without a service level agreement.
+ Preview features might undergo breaking changes if a redesign is required. 
+ Sometimes preview features don't make it into a GA release.

If you write code against a preview API, you should prepare to upgrade that code to newer API versions when they roll out. We maintain an [Upgrade REST APIs](search-api-migration.md) document to make that step easier.

## How to call a preview REST API

Preview REST APIs are accessed through the api-version parameter on the URI. Older previews are still operational but become stale over time and aren't updated with new features or bug fixes.

For data plane operation on content, [**`2024-05-01-preview`**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2024-05-01-Preview) is the most recent preview version. The following example shows the syntax for [Indexes GET (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/get?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true):

```rest
GET {endpoint}/indexes('{indexName}')?api-version=2024-05-01-Preview
```

For management operations on the search service, [**`2025-05-01-preview`**](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/update?view=rest-searchmanagement-2025-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true) is the most recent preview version. The following example shows the syntax for Update Service 2025-05-01-preview version.

```rest
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/subid/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/mysearchservice?api-version=2025-05-01-preview

{
  "tags": {
    "app-name": "My e-commerce app",
    "new-tag": "Adding a new tag"
  },
  "properties": {
    "replicaCount": 2
  }
}
```
