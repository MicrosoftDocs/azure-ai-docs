# Preview features in Azure AI Search

This article identifies all data plane and control plane features in public preview. This list is helpful for checking feature status. It also explains how to call a preview REST API.

Preview API versions are cumulative and roll up to the next preview. We recommend always using the latest preview APIs for full access to all preview features.

Preview features are removed from this list if they're retired or transition to general availability. For announcements regarding general availability and retirement, see [Service Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=search) or [What's New](whats-new.md).

## Data plane preview features

|Feature&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | Category | Description | Availability  |
|---------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| [**Query rewrite in the semantic reranker**](semantic-how-to-query-rewrite.md) | Relevance (scoring) | You can set options on a semantic query to rewrite the query input into a revised or expanded query that generates more relevant results from the L2 ranker. | [Search Documents (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post?view=rest-searchservice-2024-11-01-preview&preserve-view=true).|
| [**Document Layout skill**](cognitive-search-skill-document-intelligence-layout.md) | Applied AI (skills) | A new skill used to analyze a document for structure and provide [structure-aware chunking](search-how-to-semantic-chunking.md). | [Create or Update Skillset (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/skillsets/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-11-01-preview&preserve-view=true). |
| [**Keyless billing for Azure AI skills processing**](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md). | Applied AI (skills) | You can now use a managed identity and roles for a keyless connection to Azure AI services for built-in skills processing. This capability removes restrictions for having both search and AI services in the same region.  | [Create or Update Skillset  (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/skillsets/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-11-01-preview&preserve-view=true).|
| [**Markdown parsing mode**](search-how-to-index-markdown-blobs.md) | Indexer data source | With this parsing mode, indexers can generate one-to-one or one-to-many search documents from Markdown files in Azure Storage. | [Create or Update Indexer (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexers/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-11-01-preview&preserve-view=true). |
| [**Rescoring options for compressed vectors**](vector-search-how-to-quantization.md) | Relevance (scoring) | You can set options to rescore with original vectors instead of compressed vectors. Applies to HNSW and exhaustive KNN vector algorithms, using binary and scalar compression. | [Create or Update Index (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-09-01-preview&preserve-view=true).|
| [**Lower the dimension requirements for MRL-trained text embedding models on Azure OpenAI**](vector-search-how-to-truncate-dimensions.md) | Index | Text-embedding-3-small and Text-embedding-3-large are trained using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). This allows you to truncate the embedding vectors to fewer dimensions, and adjust the balance between vector index size usage and retrieval quality. A new `truncationDimension` provides the MRL behaviors as an extra parameter in a vector compression configuration. This can only be configured for new vector fields. | [Create or Update Index (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-09-01-preview&preserve-view=true). |

## Preview features in Azure SDKs

Each Azure SDK team releases beta packages on their own timeline. Check the change log for mentions of new features in beta packages:

+ [Change log for Azure SDK for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/search/search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md).

## Using preview features

Experimental features are available through the preview REST API first, followed by Azure portal, and then the Azure SDKs. 

The following statements apply to preview features:

+ Preview features are available under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), without a service level agreement.
+ Preview features might undergo breaking changes if a redesign is required. 
+ Sometimes preview features don't make it into a GA release.

If you write code against a preview API, you should prepare to upgrade that code to newer API versions when they roll out. We maintain an [Upgrade REST APIs](search-api-migration.md) document to make that step easier.

## How to call a preview REST API

Preview REST APIs are accessed through the api-version parameter on the URI. Older previews are still operational but become stale over time and aren't updated with new features or bug fixes.

For data plane operation on content, [**`2024-05-01-preview`**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2024-05-01-Preview) is the most recent preview version. The following example shows the syntax for [Indexes GET (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/get?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true):

```rest
GET {endpoint}/indexes('{indexName}')?api-version=2024-05-01-Preview
```

For management operations on the search service, [**`2024-06-01-preview`**](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/update?view=rest-searchmanagement-2024-06-01-preview&preserve-view=true) is the most recent preview version. The following example shows the syntax for Update Service 2024-06-01-preview version.

```rest
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/subid/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/mysearchservice?api-version=2024-06-01-preview

{
  "tags": {
    "app-name": "My e-commerce app",
    "new-tag": "Adding a new tag"
  },
  "properties": {
    "replicaCount": 2
  }
}
```
