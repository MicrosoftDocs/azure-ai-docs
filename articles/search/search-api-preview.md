# Preview features in Azure AI Search

This article identifies all data plane and control plane features in public preview. This list is helpful for checking feature status. It also explains how to call a preview REST API.

Preview API versions are cumulative and roll up to the next preview. We recommend always using the latest preview APIs for full access to all preview features.

Preview features are removed from this list if they're retired or transition to general availability. For announcements regarding general availability and retirement, see [Service Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=search) or [What's New](whats-new.md).

## Data plane preview features

|Feature&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | Category | Description | Availability  |
|---------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| [**"Fast path" for knowledge agents**](search-agentic-retrieval-how-to-create.md) | Agentic search | New `attemptFastPath` boolean for knowledge agents. Enables a shorter processing time if queries are concise and the initial response is sufficiently relevant. | [Knowledge Agents - Create Or Update (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/knowledge-agents/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true) |
| [**Retrieval instructions**](search-agentic-retrieval-how-to-create.md) | Agentic search | New `retrievalInstructions` property for knowledge agents guides query planning in an agentic retrieval workflow. For example, you can specify criteria for including or excluding specific knowledge sources. | [Knowledge Agents - Create Or Update (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/knowledge-agents/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true) |
| [**Improved indexer runtime tracking information**](search-howto-run-reset-indexers.md) | Indexers | New cumulative indexer processing information for the search service and for specific indexers. | [Get Service Statistics (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/get-service-statistics/get-service-statistics?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true) and [Get Status - Indexers (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/get-service-statistics/get-service-statistics?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true) |
| [**Strict postfiltering for vector queries**](vector-search-filters.md) | Vectors | New `strictPostFilter` mode for the `vectorFilterMode` parameter. When specified, filters are applied after the global top-`k` vector results are identified, ensuring that returned documents are a subset of the unfiltered results. | [Search Documents (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true). |
| [**Agentic retrieval**](search-agentic-retrieval-concept.md) | Query | Create a conversational search experience powered by large language models (LLMs) and your proprietary content. Agentic retrieval breaks down complex user queries into subqueries, runs the subqueries simultaneously, and either extracts grounding data or synthesizes an answer based on documents indexed in Azure AI Search. To get started, see [Quickstart: Agentic retrieval](search-get-started-agentic-retrieval.md).<p>The pipeline involves one or more [knowledge sources](search-knowledge-source-overview.md) and an associated [knowledge agent](search-agentic-retrieval-how-to-create.md), whose [response payload](search-agentic-retrieval-how-to-retrieve.md) provides full transparency into the query plan and reference data. Knowledge sources currently support [search indexes](search-knowledge-source-how-to-index.md) and [Azure blobs](search-knowledge-source-how-to-blob.md). | [Knowledge Sources (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/knowledge-sources?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true), [Knowledge Agents (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/knowledge-agents?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true), and [Knowledge Retrieval (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/knowledge-retrieval?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true). |

## Control plane preview features

Currently, there are no control plane features in preview.

## Preview features in Azure SDKs

Each Azure SDK team releases beta packages on their own timeline. Check the change log for mentions of new features in beta packages:

+ [Change log for Azure SDK for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/search/search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md).

## Using preview features

Experimental features are available through the preview REST API first, followed by Azure portal, and then the Azure SDKs. 

The following statements apply to preview features:

+ Preview features are available under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), without a service level agreement.
+ Preview features might undergo breaking changes if a redesign is required. 
+ Sometimes preview features don't make it into a GA release.

If you write code against a preview API, you should prepare to upgrade that code to newer API versions when they roll out. We maintain an [Upgrade REST APIs](search-api-migration.md) document to make that step easier.

## How to call a preview REST API

Preview REST APIs are accessed through the api-version parameter on the URI. Older previews are still operational but become stale over time and aren't updated with new features or bug fixes.

For data plane operations on content, [**`2025-08-01-preview`**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2025-08-01-Preview) is the most recent preview version. The following example shows the syntax for [Indexes GET (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/get?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true):

```rest
GET {endpoint}/indexes('{indexName}')?api-version=2024-05-01-Preview
```

For management operations on the search service, [**`2025-05-01-preview`**](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/update?view=rest-searchmanagement-2025-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true) is the most recent preview version. The following example shows the syntax for Update Service 2025-05-01-preview version.

```rest
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/subid/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/mysearchservice?api-version=2025-05-01-preview

{
  "tags": {
    "app-name": "My e-commerce app",
    "new-tag": "Adding a new tag"
  },
  "properties": {
    "replicaCount": 2
  }
}
```
