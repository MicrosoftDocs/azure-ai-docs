# Tutorial: Verbalize images using generative AI

Azure AI Search can extract and index both text and images from PDF documents stored in Azure Blob Storage. This tutorial shows you how to build a multimodal indexing pipeline that *chunks data  using the built-in Text Split skill* and uses *image verbalization* to describe images. Cropped images are stored in a knowledge store, and visual content is described in natural language and ingested alongside text in a searchable index.

To get image verbalizations, each extracted image is passed to the [GenAI Prompt skill (preview)](cognitive-search-skill-genai-prompt.md) that calls a chat completion model to generate a concise textual description. These descriptions, along with the original document text, are then embedded into vector representations using Azure OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-large model. The result is a single index containing searchable content from both modalities: text and verbalized images.

In this tutorial, you use:

+ A 36-page PDF document that combines rich visual content, such as charts, infographics, and scanned pages, with traditional text.

+ An indexer and skillset to create an indexing pipeline that includes AI enrichment through skills.

+ The [Document Extraction skill](cognitive-search-skill-document-extraction.md) for extracting normalized images and text. The [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) chunks the data.

+ The [GenAI Prompt skill (preview)](cognitive-search-skill-genai-prompt.md) that calls a chat completion model to create descriptions of visual content.

+ A search index configured to store text and image verbalizations. Some content is vectorized for vector-based similarity search.

This tutorial demonstrates a lower-cost approach for indexing multimodal content using the Document Extraction skill and image captioning. It enables extraction and search over both text and images from documents in Azure Blob Storage. However, it doesn't include locational metadata for text, such as page numbers or bounding regions. For a more comprehensive solution that includes structured text layout and spatial metadata, see [Tutorial: Verbalize images from a structured document layout](tutorial-document-layout-image-verbalization.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Image extraction by the Document Extraction skill isn't free. Setting `imageAction` to `generateNormalizedImages` in the skillset triggers image extraction, which is an extra charge. For billing information, see [Azure AI Search pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).

## Prerequisites

+ [Azure AI Search](search-create-service-portal.md). [Configure your search service](search-manage.md) for role-based access control and a managed identity. Your service must be on the Basic tier or higher. This tutorial isn't supported on the Free tier.

+ [Azure Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create), used for storing sample data and for creating a [knowledge store](knowledge-store-concept-intro.md).

+ [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/create-resource) with a deployment of

  + A chat completion model hosted in Microsoft Foundry or another source. The model is used to verbalize image content. You provide the URI to the hosted model in the GenAI Prompt skill definition. You can use [any chat completion model](cognitive-search-skill-genai-prompt.md#supported-models).

  + A text embedding model deployed in Foundry. The model is used to vectorize text content pull from source documents and the image descriptions generated by the chat completion model. For integrated vectorization, the embedding model must be located in Foundry, and it must be either text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-large, or text-embedding-3-small. If you want to use an external embedding model, use a custom skill instead of the Azure OpenAI embedding skill.

+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with a [REST client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

## Prepare data

The following instructions apply to Azure Storage which provides the sample data and also hosts the knowledge store. A search service identity needs read access to Azure Storage to retrieve the sample data, and it needs write access to create the knowledge store. The search service creates the container for cropped images during skillset processing, using the name you provide in an environment variable.

1. Download the following sample PDF: [sustainable-ai-pdf](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/msc/documents/presentations/CSR/Accelerating-Sustainability-with-AI-2025.pdf)

1. In Azure Storage, create a new container named **sustainable-ai-pdf**.

1. [Upload the sample data file](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal).

1. [Create role assignments and specify a managed identity in a connection string](search-howto-managed-identities-storage.md):

   1. Assign **Storage Blob Data Reader** for data retrieval by the indexer. Assign **Storage Blob Data Contributor** and **Storage Table Data Contributor** to create and load the knowledge store. You can use either a system-assigned managed identity or a user-assigned managed identity for your search service role assignment.

   1. For connections made using a system-assigned managed identity, get a connection string that contains a ResourceId, with no account key or password. The ResourceId must include the subscription ID of the storage account, the resource group of the storage account, and the storage account name. The connection string is similar to the following example:

        ```json
        "credentials" : { 
            "connectionString" : "ResourceId=/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000/resourceGroups/MY-DEMO-RESOURCE-GROUP/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/MY-DEMO-STORAGE-ACCOUNT/;" 
        }
        ```

   1. For connections made using a user-assigned managed identity, get a connection string that contains a ResourceId, with no account key or password. The ResourceId must include the subscription ID of the storage account, the resource group of the storage account, and the storage account name. Provide an identity using the syntax shown in the following example. Set userAssignedIdentity to the user-assigned managed identity. The connection string is similar to the following example:

      ```json
      "credentials" : { 
          "connectionString" : "ResourceId=/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000/resourceGroups/MY-DEMO-RESOURCE-GROUP/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/MY-DEMO-STORAGE-ACCOUNT/;" 
      },
      "identity" : { 
          "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.DataUserAssignedIdentity",
          "userAssignedIdentity" : "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000/resourcegroups/MY-DEMO-RESOURCE-GROUP/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/MY-DEMO-USER-MANAGED-IDENTITY" 
      }
      ```

## Prepare models

This tutorial assumes you have an existing Azure OpenAI resource through which the skills call the text embedding model and chat completion models. The search service connects to the models during skillset processing and during query execution using its managed identity. This section gives you guidance and links for assigning roles for authorized access.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal (not the Foundry portal) and find the Azure OpenAI resource.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add** and then **Add role assignment**.

1. Search for **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** and then select it.

1. Choose **Managed identity** and then assign your [search service managed identity](search-how-to-managed-identities.md).

For more information, see [Role-based access control for Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models](/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).

## Set up your REST file

For this tutorial, your local REST client connection to Azure AI Search requires an endpoint and an API key. You can get these values from the Azure portal. For alternative connection methods, see [Connect to a search service](search-get-started-rbac.md).

For authenticated connections that occur during indexer and skillset processing, the search service uses the role assignments you previously defined.

1. Start Visual Studio Code and create a new file.

1. Provide values for variables used in the request. For `@storageConnection`, make sure your connection string doesn't have a trailing semicolon or quotation marks. For `@imageProjectionContainer`, provide a container name that's unique in blob storage. Azure AI Search creates this container for you during skills processing.

   ```http
   @searchUrl = PUT-YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-ENDPOINT-HERE
   @searchApiKey = PUT-YOUR-ADMIN-API-KEY-HERE
   @storageConnection = PUT-YOUR-STORAGE-CONNECTION-STRING-HERE
   @openAIResourceUri = PUT-YOUR-OPENAI-URI-HERE
   @openAIKey = PUT-YOUR-OPENAI-KEY-HERE
   @chatCompletionResourceUri = PUT-YOUR-CHAT-COMPLETION-URI-HERE
   @chatCompletionKey = PUT-YOUR-CHAT-COMPLETION-KEY-HERE
   @imageProjectionContainer=sustainable-ai-pdf-images
   ```

1. Save the file using a `.rest` or `.http` file extension. For help with the REST client, see [Quickstart: Full-text search using REST](search-get-started-text.md).

To get the Azure AI Search endpoint and API key:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the search service **Overview** page, and copy the URL. An example endpoint might look like `https://mydemo.search.windows.net`.

1. Under **Settings** > **Keys**, copy an admin key. Admin keys are used to add, modify, and delete objects. There are two interchangeable admin keys. Copy either one.

## Create a data source

[Create Data Source (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/data-sources/create) creates a data source connection that specifies what data to index.

```http
### Create a data source
POST {{searchUrl}}/datasources?api-version=2025-11-01-preview   HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json
  api-key: {{searchApiKey}}

  {
    "name": "doc-extraction-image-verbalization-ds",
    "description": null,
    "type": "azureblob",
    "subtype": null,
    "credentials":{
      "connectionString":"{{storageConnection}}"
    },
    "container": {

    },
    "dataChangeDetectionPolicy": null,
    "dataDeletionDetectionPolicy": null,
    "encryptionKey": null,
    "identity": null
  }
```

Send the request. The response should look like:

## Create an index

[Create Index (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create) creates a search index on your search service. An index specifies all the parameters and their attributes.

For nested JSON, the index fields must be identical to the source fields. Currently, Azure AI Search doesn't support field mappings to nested JSON, so field names and data types must match completely. The following index aligns to the JSON elements in the raw content.

```http
### Create an index

    }
}
```

Key points:

+ Text and image embeddings are stored in the `content_embedding` field and must be configured with appropriate dimensions (for example, 3072) and a vector search profile.

+ `location_metadata` captures bounding polygon and page number metadata for each normalized image, enabling precise spatial search or UI overlays. `location_metadata` only exists for images in this scenario. If you'd like to capture locational metadata for text as well, consider using [Document Layout skill](cognitive-search-skill-document-intelligence-layout.md). An in-depth tutorial is linked at the bottom of the page.

## Create a skillset

[Create Skillset (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/skillsets/create) creates a skillset on your search service. A skillset defines the operations that chunk and embed content prior to indexing. This skillset uses the built-in Document Extraction skill to extract text and images. It uses Text Split skill to chunk large text. It uses Azure OpenAI Embedding skill to vectorize text content.

The skillset also performs actions specific to images. It uses the GenAI Prompt skill to generate image descriptions. It also creates a knowledge store that stores intact images so that you can return them in a query.

This skillset extracts text and images, vectorizes both, and shapes the image metadata for projection into the index.

Key points:

+ The `content_text` field is populated in two ways:

  + From document text extracted using the Document Extraction skill and chunked using the Text Split skill

  + From image content using the GenAI Prompt skill, which generates descriptive captions for each normalized image
  
+ The `content_embedding` field contains 3072-dimensional embeddings for both page text and verbalized image descriptions. These are generated using the text-embedding-3-large model from Azure OpenAI.

+ `content_path` contains the relative path to the image file within the designated image projection container. This field is generated only for images extracted from PDFs when `imageAction` is set to `generateNormalizedImages`, and can be mapped from the enriched document from the source field `/document/normalized_images/*/imagePath`.

## Create and run an indexer

[Create Indexer](/rest/api/searchservice/indexers/create) creates an indexer on your search service. An indexer connects to the data source, loads data, runs a skillset, and indexes the enriched data.

```http
### Create and run an indexer
POST {{searchUrl}}/indexers?api-version=2025-11-01-preview   HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json
  api-key: {{searchApiKey}}

{
  "dataSourceName": "doc-extraction-image-verbalization-ds",
  "targetIndexName": "doc-extraction-image-verbalization-index",
  "skillsetName": "doc-extraction-image-verbalization-skillset",
  "parameters": {
    "maxFailedItems": -1,
    "maxFailedItemsPerBatch": 0,
    "batchSize": 1,
    "configuration": {
      "allowSkillsetToReadFileData": true
    }
  },
  "fieldMappings": [
    {
      "sourceFieldName": "metadata_storage_name",
      "targetFieldName": "document_title"
    }
  ],
  "outputFieldMappings": []
}
```

## Run queries

You can start searching as soon as the first document is loaded.

```http
### Query the index
POST {{searchUrl}}/indexes/doc-extraction-image-verbalization-index/docs/search?api-version=2025-11-01-preview   HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json
  api-key: {{searchApiKey}}
  
  {
    "search": "*",
    "count": true
  }
```

Send the request. This is an unspecified full-text search query that returns all of the fields marked as retrievable in the index, along with a document count. The response should look like:

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/json; odata.metadata=minimal; odata.streaming=true; charset=utf-8
Content-Encoding: gzip

{
  "@odata.count": 100,
  "@search.nextPageParameters": {
    "search": "*",
    "count": true,
    "skip": 50
  },
  "value": [
  ],
  "@odata.nextLink": "https://<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME>.search.windows.net/indexes/doc-extraction-image-verbalization-index/docs/search?api-version=2025-11-01-preview "
}
```

100 documents are returned in the response.

For filters, you can also use Logical operators (and, or, not) and comparison operators (eq, ne, gt, lt, ge, le). String comparisons are case -sensitive. For more information and examples, see [Examples of simple search queries](search-query-simple-examples.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The `$filter` parameter only works on fields that were marked filterable during index creation.

Here are some examples of other queries:

```http
### Query for only images
POST {{searchUrl}}/indexes/doc-extraction-image-verbalization-index/docs/search?api-version=2025-11-01-preview   HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json
  api-key: {{searchApiKey}}
  
  {
    "search": "*",
    "count": true,
    "filter": "image_document_id ne null"
  }
```

```http
### Query for text or images with content related to energy, returning the id, parent document, and text (extracted text for text chunks and verbalized image text for images), and the content path where the image is saved in the knowledge store (only populated for images)
POST {{searchUrl}}/indexes/doc-extraction-image-verbalization-index/docs/search?api-version=2025-11-01-preview   HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json
  api-key: {{searchApiKey}}
  
  {
    "search": "energy",
    "count": true,
    "select": "content_id, document_title, content_text, content_path"
  }
```

## Reset and rerun

Indexers can be reset to clear the high-water mark, which allows a full rerun. The following POST requests are for reset, followed by rerun.

```http
### Reset the indexer
POST {{searchUrl}}/indexers/doc-extraction-image-verbalization-indexer/reset?api-version=2025-11-01-preview   HTTP/1.1
  api-key: {{searchApiKey}}
```

```http
### Run the indexer
POST {{searchUrl}}/indexers/doc-extraction-image-verbalization-indexer/run?api-version=2025-11-01-preview   HTTP/1.1
  api-key: {{searchApiKey}}
```

```http
### Check indexer status 
GET {{searchUrl}}/indexers/doc-extraction-image-verbalization-indexer/status?api-version=2025-11-01-preview   HTTP/1.1
  api-key: {{searchApiKey}}
```

## Clean up resources

When you're working in your own subscription, at the end of a project, it's a good idea to remove the resources that you no longer need. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can use the Azure portal to delete indexes, indexers, and data sources.
