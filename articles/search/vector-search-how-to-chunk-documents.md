# Chunk large documents for vector search solutions in Azure AI Search

Partitioning large documents into smaller chunks can help you stay under the maximum token input limits of embedding models. For example, the maximum length of input text for the [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) text-embedding-ada-002 model is 8,191 tokens. Given that each token is around four characters of text for common OpenAI models, this maximum limit is equivalent to around 6,000 words of text. If you're using these models to generate embeddings, it's critical that the input text stays under the limit. Partitioning your content into chunks ensures that your data can be processed by the embedding models and that you don't lose information due to truncation.

We recommend [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) for built-in data chunking and embedding. Integrated vectorization takes a dependency on indexers, skillsets, the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md), and an embedding skill like [Azure OpenAI Embedding skill](cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding.md). If you can't use integrated vectorization, this article describes some approaches for chunking your content.

## Common chunking techniques

Chunking is only required if the source documents are too large for the maximum input size imposed by models.

Here are some common chunking techniques, starting with the most widely used method:

+ Fixed-size chunks: Define a fixed size that's sufficient for semantically meaningful paragraphs (for example, 200 words) and allows for some overlap (for example, 10-15% of the content) can produce good chunks as input for embedding vector generators.

+ Variable-sized chunks based on content: Partition your data based on content characteristics, such as end-of-sentence punctuation marks, end-of-line markers, or using features in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries. Markdown language structure can also be used to split the data.

+ Customize or iterate over one of the above techniques. For example, when dealing with large documents, you might use variable-sized chunks, but also append the document title to chunks from the middle of the document to prevent context loss.

### Content overlap considerations

When you chunk data, overlapping a small amount of text between chunks can help preserve context. We recommend starting with an overlap of approximately 10%. For example, given a fixed chunk size of 256 tokens, you would begin testing with an overlap of 25 tokens. The actual amount of overlap varies depending on the type of data and the specific use case, but we have found that 10-15% works for many scenarios.

### Factors for chunking data

When it comes to chunking data, think about these factors:

+ Shape and density of your documents. If you need intact text or passages, larger chunks and variable chunking that preserves sentence structure can produce better results.

+ User queries: Larger chunks and overlapping strategies help preserve context and semantic richness for queries that target specific information.

+ Large Language Models (LLM) have performance guidelines for chunk size. you need to set a chunk size that works best for all of the models you're using. For instance, if you use models for summarization and embeddings, choose an optimal chunk size that works for both.

### How chunking fits into the workflow

If you have large documents, you must insert a chunking step into indexing and query workflows that breaks up large text. When using [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md), a default chunking strategy using the [Text Split skill](./cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) is applied. You can also apply a custom chunking strategy using a [custom skill](cognitive-search-custom-skill-web-api.md). Some libraries that provide chunking include:

+ [LangChain Text Splitters](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)
+ [Semantic Kernel TextChunker](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.text.textchunker)

Most libraries provide common chunking techniques for fixed size, variable size, or a combination. You can also specify an overlap that duplicates a small amount of content in each chunk for context preservation.

## Chunking examples

The following examples demonstrate how chunking strategies are applied to [NASA's Earth at Night e-book](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/blob/main/nasa-e-book/earth_at_night_508.pdf) PDF file:

+ [Text Split skill](#text-split-skill-example)
+ [LangChain](#langchain-data-chunking-example)
+ [Custom skill](cognitive-search-custom-skill-scale.md)

### Text Split skill example

Integrated data chunking through [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) is generally available.

This section describes built-in data chunking using a skills-driven approach and [Text Split skill parameters](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md#skill-parameters). 

A sample notebook for this example can be found on the [azure-search-vector-samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/code/data-chunking/textsplit-data-chunking-example.ipynb) repository.
Set `textSplitMode` to break up content into smaller chunks:

+ `pages` (default). Chunks are made up of multiple sentences.
+ `sentences`. Chunks are made up of single sentences. What constitutes a "sentence" is language dependent. In English, standard sentence ending punctuation such as `.` or `!` is used. The language is controlled by the `defaultLanguageCode` parameter.

The `pages` parameter adds extra parameters:

+ `maximumPageLength` defines the maximum number of characters <sup>1</sup> or tokens <sup>2</sup> in each chunk. The text splitter avoids breaking up sentences, so the actual character count depends on the content.
+ `pageOverlapLength` defines how many characters from the end of the previous page are included at the start of the next page. If set, this must be less than half the maximum page length.
+ `maximumPagesToTake` defines how many pages / chunks to take from a document. The default value is 0, which means taking all pages or chunks from the document.

<sup>1</sup> Characters don't align to the definition of a [token](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering#space-efficiency). The number of tokens measured by the LLM might be different than the character size measured by the Text Split skill.

<sup>2</sup> Token chunking is available in the [2024-09-01-preview](/rest/api/searchservice/skillsets/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-09-01-preview&preserve-view=true) and includes extra parameters for specifying a tokenizer and any tokens that shouldn't be split up during chunking.

The following table shows how the choice of parameters affects the total chunk count from the Earth at Night e-book:

| `textSplitMode` | `maximumPageLength` | `pageOverlapLength` | Total Chunk Count |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `pages` | 1000 | 0 | 172 |
| `pages` | 1000 | 200 | 216 |
| `pages` | 2000 | 0 | 85 |
| `pages` | 2000 | 500 | 113 |
| `pages` | 5000 | 0 | 34 |
| `pages` | 5000 | 500 | 38 |
| `sentences` | N/A | N/A | 13361 |

Using a `textSplitMode` of `pages` results in a majority of chunks having total character counts close to `maximumPageLength`. Chunk character count varies due to differences on where sentence boundaries fall inside the chunk. Chunk token length varies due to differences in the contents of the chunk.

The following histograms show how the distribution of chunk character length compares to chunk token length for [gpt-35-turbo](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/chatgpt) when using a `textSplitMode` of `pages`, a `maximumPageLength` of 2000, and a `pageOverlapLength` of 500 on the Earth at Night e-book:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vector-search-how-to-chunk-documents/maximumpagelength-2000-pageoverlap-500-characters.png" alt-text="Histogram of chunk character count for maximumPageLength 2000 and pageOverlapLength 500.":::

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vector-search-how-to-chunk-documents/maximumpagelength-2000-pageoverlap-500-tokens.png" alt-text="Histogram of chunk token count for maximumPageLength 2000 and pageOverlapLength 500.":::

Using a `textSplitMode` of `sentences` results in a large number of chunks consisting of individual sentences. These chunks are significantly smaller than those produced by `pages`, and the token count of the chunks more closely matches the character counts.

The following histograms show how the distribution of chunk character length compares to chunk token length for [gpt-35-turbo](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/chatgpt) when using a `textSplitMode` of `sentences` on the Earth at Night e-book:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vector-search-how-to-chunk-documents/sentences-characters.png" alt-text="Histogram of chunk character count for sentences.":::

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vector-search-how-to-chunk-documents/sentences-tokens.png" alt-text="Histogram of chunk token count for sentences.":::

The optimal choice of parameters depends on how the chunks will be used. For most applications, it's recommended to start with the following default parameters:

| `textSplitMode` | `maximumPageLength` | `pageOverlapLength` |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `pages` | 2000 | 500 |

### LangChain data chunking example

LangChain provides document loaders and text splitters. This example shows you how to load a PDF, get token counts, and set up a text splitter. Getting token counts helps you make an informed decision on chunk sizing.

A sample notebook for this example can be found on the [azure-search-vector-samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/code/data-chunking/langchain-data-chunking-example.ipynb) repository.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
 
loader = PyPDFLoader("./data/earth_at_night_508.pdf")
pages = loader.load()

print(len(pages))
```

Output indicates 200 documents or pages in the PDF.

To get an estimated token count for these pages, use TikToken.

```python
import tiktoken

tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding('cl100k_base')
def tiktoken_len(text):
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(
    text,
    disallowed_special=()
)
    return len(tokens)
tiktoken.encoding_for_model('gpt-3.5-turbo')

# create the length function
token_counts = []
for page in pages:
    token_counts.append(tiktoken_len(page.page_content))
min_token_count = min(token_counts)
avg_token_count = int(sum(token_counts) / len(token_counts))
max_token_count = max(token_counts)

# print token counts
print(f"Min: {min_token_count}")
print(f"Avg: {avg_token_count}")
print(f"Max: {max_token_count}")
```

Output indicates that no pages have zero tokens, the average token length per page is 189 tokens, and the maximum token count of any page is 1,583.

Knowing the average and maximum token size gives you insight into setting chunk size. Although you could use the standard recommendation of 2000 characters with a 500 character overlap, in this case it makes sense to go lower given the token counts of the sample document. In fact, setting an overlap value that's too large can result in no overlap appearing at all.

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
# split documents into text and embeddings

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
   chunk_size=1000, 
   chunk_overlap=200,
   length_function=len,
   is_separator_regex=False
)

chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)

print(chunks[20])
print(chunks[21])
```

Output for two consecutive chunks shows the text from the first chunk overlapping onto the second chunk. Output is lightly edited for readability.

### Custom skill

A [fixed-sized chunking and embedding generation sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills/blob/main/Vector/EmbeddingGenerator/README.md) demonstrates both chunking and vector embedding generation using [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/) embedding models. This sample uses an [Azure AI Search custom skill](cognitive-search-custom-skill-web-api.md) in the [Power Skills repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills/tree/main#readme) to wrap the chunking step.
