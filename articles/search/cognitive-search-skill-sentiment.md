# Sentiment cognitive skill (v2)

The **Sentiment** skill (v2) evaluates unstructured text along a positive-negative continuum, and for each record, returns a numeric score between 0 and 1. Scores close to 1 indicate positive sentiment, and scores close to 0 indicate negative sentiment. This skill uses the machine learning models provided by [Text Analytics](/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview) in Azure AI services.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Sentiment skill (v2) (**Microsoft.Skills.Text.SentimentSkill**) is now discontinued replaced by [Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.SentimentSkill](cognitive-search-skill-sentiment-v3.md). Follow the recommendations in [Deprecated Azure AI Search skills](cognitive-search-skill-deprecated.md) to migrate to a supported skill.

> [!NOTE]
> As you expand scope by increasing the frequency of processing, adding more documents, or adding more AI algorithms, you will need to [attach a billable Azure AI services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md). Charges accrue when calling APIs in Azure AI services, and for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure AI Search. There are no charges for text extraction from documents.
>
> Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existing [Azure AI services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/). Image extraction pricing is described on the [Azure AI Search pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).
