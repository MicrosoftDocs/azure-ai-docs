#	Named Entity Recognition cognitive skill (v2)

The **Named Entity Recognition** skill (v2) extracts named entities from text. Available entities include the types `person`, `location` and `organization`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Named entity recognition skill (v2) (**Microsoft.Skills.Text.NamedEntityRecognitionSkill**) is now discontinued replaced by [Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.EntityRecognitionSkill](cognitive-search-skill-entity-recognition-v3.md). Follow the recommendations in [Deprecated Azure AI Search skills](cognitive-search-skill-deprecated.md) to migrate to a supported skill.

 > [!NOTE]
> As you expand scope by increasing the frequency of processing, adding more documents, or adding more AI algorithms, you will need to [attach a billable Azure AI services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md). Charges accrue when calling APIs in Azure AI services, and for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure AI Search. There are no charges for text extraction from documents. Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existing [Azure AI services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/).
> 
> Image extraction is an extra charge metered by Azure AI Search, as described on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/). Text extraction is free.

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.NamedEntityRecognitionSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured by [`String.Length`](/dotnet/api/system.string.length). If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phrase extractor, consider using the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md). If you do use a text split skill, set the page length to 5000 for the best performance.

## Skill parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Parameter name	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| categories	| Array of categories that should be extracted.  Possible category types: `"Person"`, `"Location"`, `"Organization"`. If no category is provided, all types are returned.|
|defaultLanguageCode |	Language code of the input text. The following languages are supported: `de, en, es, fr, it`|
| minimumPrecision	| A number between 0 and 1. If the precision is lower than this value, the entity is not returned. The default is 0.|

## Skill inputs

| Input name	  | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| languageCode	| Optional. Default is `"en"`.  |
