# Quickstart: Keyword search by using REST

The REST APIs in Azure AI Search provide programmatic access to all of its capabilities, including preview features, and they're an easy way to learn how features work. In this quickstart, learn how to call the [Search REST APIs](/rest/api/searchservice) to create, load, and query a search index in Azure AI Search.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with a [REST client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

- [Azure AI Search](search-what-is-azure-search.md). [Create](search-create-service-portal.md) or [find an existing Azure AI Search resource](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices) under your current subscription. You can use a free service for this quickstart.

## Download files

[Download a REST sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/Quickstart) from GitHub to send the requests in this quickstart. Instructions can be found at [Downloading files from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github).

You can also start a new file on your local system and create requests manually by using the instructions in this article.

## Get a search service endpoint

You can find the search service endpoint in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and [find your search service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices).

1. On the **Overview** home page, find the URL. An example endpoint might look like `https://mydemo.search.windows.net`. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/search-get-started-rest/get-endpoint.png" lightbox="media/search-get-started-rest/get-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the URL property on the overview page.":::

You're pasting this endpoint into the `.rest` or `.http` file in a later step.

## Configure access

Requests to the search endpoint must be authenticated and authorized. You can use API keys or roles for this task. Keys are easier to start with, but roles are more secure.

For a role-based connection, the following instructions have you connecting to Azure AI Search under your identity, not the identity of a client app.

### Option 1: Use keys

Select **Settings** > **Keys** and then copy an admin key. Admin keys are used to add, modify, and delete objects. There are two interchangeable admin keys. Copy either one. For more information, see [Connect to Azure AI Search using key authentication](search-security-api-keys.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/search-get-started-rest/get-api-key.png" lightbox="media/search-get-started-rest/get-api-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the API keys in the Azure portal.":::

You're pasting this key into the `.rest` or `.http` file in a later step.

### Option 2: Use roles

Make sure your search service is [configured for role-based access](search-security-enable-roles.md). You must have preconfigured [role-assignments for developer access](search-security-rbac.md#assign-roles-for-development). Your role assignments must grant permission to create, load, and query a search index. 

In this section, obtain your personal identity token using either the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal. 

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Sign in to Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Get your personal identity token.

    ```azurecli
    az account get-access-token --scope https://search.azure.com/.default
    ```

#### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Sign in with PowerShell.

    ```azurepowershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Get your personal identity token.

    ```azurepowershell
    Get-AzAccessToken -ResourceUrl https://search.azure.com
    ```

#### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

Use the steps found here: [find the user object ID](/partner-center/find-ids-and-domain-names#find-the-user-object-id) in the Azure portal.

---

You're pasting your personal identity token into the `.rest` or `.http` file in a later step.

> [!NOTE]
> This section assumes you're using a local client that connects to Azure AI Search on your behalf. An alternative approach is [getting a token for the client app](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow), assuming your application is [registered](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Set up Visual Studio Code

If you're not familiar with the REST client for Visual Studio Code, this section includes setup so that you can complete the tasks in this quickstart.

1. Start Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** tile.

1. Search for the REST client and select **Install**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/search-get-started-rest/rest-client-install.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the REST client Install button.":::

1. Open or create a new file named with either a `.rest` or `.http` file extension.

1. Paste in the following example if you're using API keys. Replace the `@baseUrl` and `@apiKey` placeholders with the values you copied earlier, without quotes.

   ```http
   @baseUrl = PUT-YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-ENDPOINT-HERE
   @apiKey = PUT-YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-API-KEY-HERE
    
    ### List existing indexes by name
    GET  {{baseUrl}}/indexes?api-version=2024-07-01&$select=name  HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      api-key: {{apiKey}}
    ```

1. Or, paste in this example if your using roles. Replace the `@baseUrl` and `@token` placeholders with the values you copied earlier, without quotes.

   ```http
   @baseUrl = PUT-YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-ENDPOINT-HERE
   @token = PUT-YOUR-PERSONAL-IDENTITY-TOKEN-HERE
    
    ### List existing indexes by name
    GET  {{baseUrl}}/indexes?api-version=2024-07-01&$select=name  HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
    ```

1. Select **Send request**. A response should appear in an adjacent pane. If you have existing indexes, they're listed. Otherwise, the list is empty. If the HTTP code is `200 OK`, you're ready for the next steps.

   :::image type="content" source="media/search-get-started-rest/rest-client-request-setup.png" lightbox="media/search-get-started-rest/rest-client-request-setup.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a REST client configured for a search service request.":::

    If you get `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="Azure Cognitive Search" error="invalid_token" error_description="Authentication token failed validation."`, remove the quotes around the token, save the file, and retry your request.

    Key points:
  
    - Parameters are specified by using an `@` prefix.
    - `###` designates a REST call. The next line contains the request, which must include `HTTP/1.1`.
    - `Send request` should appear above the request.

## Create an index

Add a second request to your `.rest` file. [Create Index (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create) creates a search index and sets up the physical data structures on your search service.

1. Paste in the following example to create the `hotels-quickstart` index on your search service.

    ```http
    ### Create a new index
    POST {{baseUrl}}/indexes?api-version=2024-07-01  HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
    
        {
            "name": "hotels-quickstart",  
            "fields": [
                {"name": "HotelId", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true, "filterable": true},
                {"name": "HotelName", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": true, "facetable": false},
                {"name": "Description", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "analyzer": "en.lucene"},
                {"name": "Category", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "Tags", "type": "Collection(Edm.String)", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": false, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "ParkingIncluded", "type": "Edm.Boolean", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "LastRenovationDate", "type": "Edm.DateTimeOffset", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "Rating", "type": "Edm.Double", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "Address", "type": "Edm.ComplexType", 
                    "fields": [
                    {"name": "StreetAddress", "type": "Edm.String", "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "searchable": true},
                    {"name": "City", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                    {"name": "StateProvince", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                    {"name": "PostalCode", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                    {"name": "Country", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true}
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ```

1. Select **Send request**. You should have an `HTTP/1.1 201 Created` response and the response body should include the JSON representation of the index schema.

   If you get a `Header name must be a valid HTTP token ["{"]` error, make sure there's an empty line between `api-key` and the body of the request. If you get HTTP 504, verify that the URL specifies HTTPS. If you see HTTP 400 or 404, check the request body to verify there were no copy-paste errors. An HTTP 403 typically indicates a problem with the API key. It's either an invalid key or a syntax problem with how the API key is specified.

   You now have several requests in your file. Recall that `###` starts a new request and each request runs independently.

   :::image type="content" source="media/search-get-started-rest/rest-client-multiple-calls.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the REST client with multiple requests.":::

### About the index definition

Within the index schema, the fields collection defines document structure. Each document that you upload must have these fields. Each field must be assigned to an [Entity Data Model (EDM) data type](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types). String fields are used in full text search. If you want numeric data to be searchable, make sure the data type is `Edm.String`. Other data types such as `Edm.Int32` are filterable, sortable, facetable, and retrievable but not full-text searchable.

Attributes on the field determine allowed actions. The REST APIs allow [many actions by default](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create#request-body). For example, all strings are searchable and retrievable by default. For REST APIs, you might only have attributes if you need to turn off a behavior.

```json
{
    "name": "hotels-quickstart",  
    "fields": [
        {"name": "HotelId", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true, "filterable": true},
        {"name": "HotelName", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": true, "facetable": false},
        {"name": "Description", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "analyzer": "en.lucene"},
        {"name": "Category", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
        {"name": "Tags", "type": "Collection(Edm.String)", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": false, "facetable": true},
        {"name": "ParkingIncluded", "type": "Edm.Boolean", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
        {"name": "LastRenovationDate", "type": "Edm.DateTimeOffset", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
        {"name": "Rating", "type": "Edm.Double", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
        {"name": "Address", "type": "Edm.ComplexType", 
        "fields": [
        {"name": "StreetAddress", "type": "Edm.String", "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "searchable": true},
        {"name": "City", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
        {"name": "StateProvince", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
        {"name": "PostalCode", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
        {"name": "Country", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true}
        ]
     }
  ]
}
```

## Load documents

Creating and loading the index are separate steps. In Azure AI Search, the index contains all searchable data and queries run on the search service. For REST calls, the data is provided as JSON documents. Use [Documents- Index REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/) for this task.

The URI is extended to include the `docs` collections and `index` operation.

1. Paste in the following example to upload JSON documents to the search index.

    ```http
    ### Upload documents
    POST {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs/index?api-version=2024-07-01  HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

            "ParkingIncluded": true,
            "LastRenovationDate": "1960-02-06T00:00:00Z",
            "Rating": 4.60,
            "Address": 
                {
                "StreetAddress": "7400 San Pedro Ave",
                "City": "San Antonio",
                "StateProvince": "TX",
                "PostalCode": "78216",
                "Country": "USA"
                }
            }
          ]
        }
    ```

1. Select **Send request**. In a few seconds, you should see an HTTP 201 response in the adjacent pane. 

   If you get a 207, at least one document failed to upload. If you get a 404, you have a syntax error in either the header or body of the request. Verify that you changed the endpoint to include `/docs/index`.

## Run queries

Now that documents are loaded, you can issue queries against them by using [Documents - Search Post (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post).

The URI is extended to include a query expression, which is specified by using the `/docs/search` operator.

1. Paste in the following example to query the search index. Then select **Send request**. A text search request always includes a `search` parameter. This example includes an optional `searchFields` parameter that constrains text search to specific fields.

    ```http
    ### Run a query
    POST {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs/search?api-version=2024-07-01  HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
      
      {
          "search": "lake view",
          "select": "HotelId, HotelName, Tags, Description",
          "searchFields": "Description, Tags",
          "count": true
      }
    ```

1. Review the response in the adjacent pane. You should have a count that indicates the number of matches found in the index, a search score that indicates relevance, and values for each field listed in the `select` statement.

    ```json
    {
      "@odata.context": "https://my-demo.search.windows.net/indexes('hotels-quickstart')/$metadata#docs(*)",
      "@odata.count": 1,
      "value": [
        {
          "@search.score": 0.6189728,
          "HotelId": "4",
          "HotelName": "Sublime Palace Hotel",
          "Description": "Sublime Palace Hotel is located in the heart of the historic center of Sublime in an extremely vibrant and lively area within short walking distance to the sites and landmarks of the city and is surrounded by the extraordinary beauty of churches, buildings, shops and monuments. Sublime Palace is part of a lovingly restored 1800 palace.",
          "Tags": [
            "concierge",
            "view",
            "24-hour front desk service"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Get index properties

You can also use [Get Statistics](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/get-statistics) to query for document counts and index size.

1. Paste in the following example to query the search index. Then select **Send request**.

    ```http
    ### Get index statistics
    GET {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-quickstart/stats?api-version=2024-07-01  HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
    ```

1. Review the response. This operation is an easy way to get details about index storage.

    ```json
    {
      "@odata.context": "https://my-demo.search.windows.net/$metadata#Microsoft.Azure.Search.V2023_11_01.IndexStatistics",
      "documentCount": 4,
      "storageSize": 34707,
      "vectorIndexSize": 0
    }
    ```

## Clean up resources

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can find and manage resources in the Azure portal by using the **All resources** or **Resource groups** link in the leftmost pane.

You can also try this `DELETE` command:

```http
### Delete an index
DELETE  {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-quickstart?api-version=2024-07-01 HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: {{apiKey}}
```

## Next step

Now that you're familiar with the REST client and making REST calls to Azure AI Search, try another quickstart that demonstrates vector support.
