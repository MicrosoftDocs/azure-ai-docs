Each Azure AI Search service has an *endpoint*, which is a unique URL that identifies and provides network access to the service. In a later section, you specify this endpoint to connect to your search service programmatically.

To get the endpoint:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your search service.

1. From the left pane, select **Overview**.

1. Make a note of the endpoint, which should look like `https://my-service.search.windows.net`.
