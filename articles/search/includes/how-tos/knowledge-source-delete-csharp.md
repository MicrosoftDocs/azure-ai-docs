Before you can delete a knowledge source, you must delete any knowledge base that references it or update the knowledge base definition to remove the reference. For knowledge sources that generate an index and indexer pipeline, all *generated objects* are also deleted. However, if you used an existing index to create a knowledge source, your index isn't deleted.

If you try to delete a knowledge source that's in use, the action fails and returns a list of affected knowledge bases.

To delete a knowledge source:

1. Get a list of all knowledge bases on your search service.

    ```csharp
    using Azure.Search.Documents.Indexes;
    
    var indexClient = new SearchIndexClient(new Uri(searchEndpoint), credential);
    var knowledgeBases = indexClient.GetKnowledgeBasesAsync();
    
    Console.WriteLine("Knowledge Bases:");
    
    await foreach (var kb in knowledgeBases)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"  - {kb.Name}");
    }
    ```

   An example response might look like the following:

   ```md
    Knowledge Bases:
      - earth-knowledge-base
      - hotels-sample-knowledge-base
      - my-demo-knowledge-base
    ```

1. Get an individual knowledge base definition to check for knowledge source references.

    ```csharp
    using Azure.Search.Documents.Indexes;
    using System.Text.Json;
    
    var indexClient = new SearchIndexClient(new Uri(searchEndpoint), credential);
    
    // Specify the knowledge base name to retrieve
    string kbNameToGet = "earth-knowledge-base";
    
    // Get a specific knowledge base definition
    var knowledgeBaseResponse = await indexClient.GetKnowledgeBaseAsync(kbNameToGet);
    var kb = knowledgeBaseResponse.Value;
    
    // Serialize to JSON for display
    string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(kb, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true });
    Console.WriteLine(json);
    ```
    
   An example response might look like the following:

   ```json
    {
      "Name": "earth-knowledge-base",
      "KnowledgeSources": [
        {
          "Name": "earth-knowledge-source"
        }
      ],
      "Models": [
        {}
      ],
      "RetrievalReasoningEffort": {},
      "OutputMode": {},
      "ETag": "\u00220x8DE278629D782B3\u0022",
      "EncryptionKey": null,
      "Description": null,
      "RetrievalInstructions": null,
      "AnswerInstructions": null
    }
   ```

1. Either delete the knowledge base or [update the knowledge base](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.searchindexclient.createorupdateknowledgebaseasync?view=azure-dotnet-preview&preserve-view=true) to remove the knowledge source if you have multiple sources. This example shows deletion.

    ```csharp
    using Azure.Search.Documents.Indexes;
    var indexClient = new SearchIndexClient(new Uri(searchEndpoint), credential);
    
    await indexClient.DeleteKnowledgeBaseAsync(knowledgeBaseName);
    System.Console.WriteLine($"Knowledge base '{knowledgeBaseName}' deleted successfully.");
    ```

1. Delete the knowledge source.

    ```csharp
    await indexClient.DeleteKnowledgeSourceAsync(knowledgeSourceName);
    System.Console.WriteLine($"Knowledge source '{knowledgeSourceName}' deleted successfully.");
    ```
