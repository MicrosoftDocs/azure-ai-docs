When you work in your own subscription, it's a good idea to finish a project by removing the resources you no longer need. Resources that are left running can cost you money.

In the Azure portal, select **All resources** or **Resource groups** from the left pane to find and manage resources. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to remove all resources at once.

If you're using a free search service, remember that you're limited to three indexes, indexers, and data sources. You can [delete individual items](../search-how-to-manage-index.md) in the portal to stay under the limit.
