# Use this file to describe authentication using a managed identity. For search-only scenarios, use resource-authentication.md.
---

Before you begin, make sure you have permissions to access content and operations. This quickstart uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and role-based access for authorization. You must be an **Owner** or **User Access Administrator** to assign roles. If roles aren't feasible, use [key-based authentication](../../search-security-api-keys.md) instead.

To configure role-based access, select both of the following tabs.

<!--
1. [Enable role-based access](../../search-security-enable-roles.md).

1. [Configure a system-assigned managed identity](../../search-how-to-managed-identities.md#create-a-system-managed-identity).

1. [Assign the following roles](../../search-security-rbac.md) to your user account.
