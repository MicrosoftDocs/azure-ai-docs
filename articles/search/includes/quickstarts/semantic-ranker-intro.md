In this quickstart, you learn how to add semantic ranking to an existing index. You can use the hotels-sample-index or one of your own.

In Azure AI Search, [semantic ranking](../../semantic-search-overview.md) is query-side functionality that uses machine reading comprehension from Microsoft to rescore search results, promoting the most semantically relevant matches to the top of the list. Depending on the content and the query, semantic ranking can [significantly improve search relevance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai-services-blog/azure-cognitive-search-outperforming-vector-search-with-hybrid/ba-p/3929167) with minimal developer effort. 

You can add a semantic configuration to an existing index with no rebuild requirement. Semantic ranking is most effective on text that's informational or descriptive.

In this quickstart, you learn how to:

> + Add semantic parameters to a query

## Prerequisites

+ An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

+ An [Azure AI Search service](../../search-create-service-portal.md), at Basic tier or higher, with [semantic ranker enabled](../../semantic-how-to-enable-disable.md).

+ A [new or existing index](../../search-how-to-create-search-index.md) with descriptive or verbose text fields, attributed as retrievable in your index. This quickstart assumes the [hotels-sample-index](../../search-get-started-portal.md).

## Configure access

You can connect to your Azure AI Search service [using API keys](../../search-security-api-keys.md) or Microsoft Entra ID with role assignments. Keys are easier to start with, but roles are more secure.

To configure role-based access:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your search service.

1. From the left pane, select **Settings** > **Keys**.

1. Under **API Access control**, select **Both**.

   This option enables both key-based and keyless authentication. After you assign roles, you can return to this step and select **Role-based access control**.

1. From the left pane, select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Assign these roles to your user account:

   + **Search Service Contributor**

   + **Search Index Data Contributor**

For more information, see [Connect to Azure AI Search using roles](../../search-security-rbac.md).

## Start with an index

This quickstart assumes an existing index, modified to include a semantic configuration. We recommend the [hotels-sample-index](../../search-get-started-portal.md) that you can create in minutes using an Azure portal wizard.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and find your search service.

1. Under **Search management** > **Indexes**, open the hotels-sample-index. Make sure the index doesn't have a semantic configuration.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/search-get-started-semantic/no-semantic-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an empty semantic configuration page in the Azure portal.":::

1. To verify the index is operational, run a query. In **Search explorer**, enter this search string *"walking distance to live music"* so that you can view the response *before* semantic ranking is applied. 

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/search-get-started-semantic/search-explorer-simple-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a query in Search Explorer in the portal.":::

   Your response should be similar to the following example, as scored by the default BM25 L1 ranker for full text search. For readability, the example selects just the "HotelName" "HotelId", and "Description" fields.

   This query is a keyword search. The results contain verbatim matches on the query terms (walking, distance, live, music) or on a linguistic variant (walk, living).
