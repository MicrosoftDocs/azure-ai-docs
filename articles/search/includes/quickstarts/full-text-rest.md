In this quickstart, you use the [Azure AI Search REST APIs](/rest/api/searchservice) to create, load, and query a search index for [full-text search](../../search-lucene-query-architecture.md). Full-text search uses Apache Lucene for indexing and queries and the BM25 ranking algorithm for scoring results.

This quickstart uses fictional hotel data from the [azure-search-sample-data](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/tree/main/hotels/hotel-json-documents) repo to populate the index.

> [!TIP]
> You can download the [source code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/Quickstart) to start with a finished project or follow these steps to create your own.

## Prerequisites

+ An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

+ An Azure AI Search service. [Create a service](../../search-create-service-portal.md) or [find an existing service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices) in your current subscription. For this quickstart, you can use a free service.

+ The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.

+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

## Configure access

You can connect to your Azure AI Search service using API keys or Microsoft Entra ID with role assignments. Keys are easier to start with, but roles are more secure.

To configure the recommended role-based access:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your search service.

1. From the left pane, select **Settings** > **Keys**.

1. Under **API Access control**, select **Both**.

   This option enables both key-based and keyless authentication. After you assign roles, you can return to this step and select **Role-based access control**.

1. From the left pane, select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Assign the **Search Service Contributor** and **Search Index Data Contributor** roles to your user account.

For more information, see [Connect to Azure AI Search using roles](../../search-security-rbac.md).

## Get endpoint and token

In the next section, you specify the following endpoint and token to establish a connection to your Azure AI Search service. These steps assume that you [configured role-based access](#configure-access).

To get your service endpoint and token:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your search service.

1. From the left pane, select **Overview**.

1. Make a note of the URL, which should be similar to `https://my-service.search.windows.net`.

1. On your local system, open a terminal.

1. Sign in to your Azure subscription. If you have multiple subscriptions, select the one that contains your search service.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Make a note of your Microsoft Entra token.

    ```azurecli
    az account get-access-token --scope https://search.azure.com/.default
    ```

## Set up your file

Before you can make REST API calls to your Azure AI Search service, you must create a file to store your service endpoint, authentication token, and eventual requests. The REST Client extension in Visual Studio Code supports this task.

To set up your request file:

1. On your local system, open Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a `.rest` or `.http` file.

1. Paste the following placeholders and request into the file.

    ```http
    @baseUrl = PUT-YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-ENDPOINT-HERE
    @token = PUT-YOUR-PERSONAL-IDENTITY-TOKEN-HERE

    ### List existing indexes by name
    GET {{baseUrl}}/indexes?api-version=2025-09-01  HTTP/1.1
        Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
    ```

1. Replace the `@baseUrl` and `@token` placeholders with the values you obtained in [Get endpoint and token](#get-endpoint-and-token). Don't include quotation marks.

1. Under `### List existing indexes by name`, select **Send Request**.

    A response should appear in an adjacent pane. If you have existing indexes, they're listed. Otherwise, the list is empty. If the HTTP code is `200 OK`, you're ready for the next steps.

## Create a search index

Before you add content to Azure AI Search, you must create an index to define how the content is stored and structured. An index is conceptually similar to a table in a relational database, but it's specifically designed for search operations, such as full-text search.

To create an index:

1. Paste the following request into your file.

    ```http
    ### Create a new index
    POST {{baseUrl}}/indexes?api-version=2025-09-01  HTTP/1.1
        Content-Type: application/json
        Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
    
        {
            "name": "hotels-quickstart",  
            "fields": [
                {"name": "HotelId", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true, "filterable": true},
                {"name": "HotelName", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": true, "facetable": false},
                {"name": "Description", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "analyzer": "en.lucene"},
                {"name": "Category", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "Tags", "type": "Collection(Edm.String)", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": false, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "ParkingIncluded", "type": "Edm.Boolean", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "LastRenovationDate", "type": "Edm.DateTimeOffset", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "Rating", "type": "Edm.Double", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                {"name": "Address", "type": "Edm.ComplexType", 
                    "fields": [
                    {"name": "StreetAddress", "type": "Edm.String", "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "searchable": true},
                    {"name": "City", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                    {"name": "StateProvince", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                    {"name": "PostalCode", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true},
                    {"name": "Country", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true}
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ```

2. Under `### Create a new index`, select **Send Request**.

   You should receive an `HTTP/1.1 201 Created` response whose body contains the JSON representation of the index schema.

### About the create index request

This quickstart calls [Indexes - Create (REST API)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create) to build a search index named `hotels-quickstart` and its physical data structures on your search service.

Within the index schema, the `fields` collection defines the structure of hotel documents. Each field has a `name`, data `type`, and attributes that determine its behavior during indexing and queries. The `HotelId` field is marked as the key, which Azure AI Search requires to uniquely identify each document in an index.

Key points about the index schema:

+ Use string fields (`Edm.String`) to make numeric data full-text searchable. Other [supported data types](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types), such as `Edm.Int32`, are filterable, sortable, facetable, and retrievable but aren't searchable.

+ Most of our fields are simple data types, but you can define complex types to represent nested data, such as the `Address` field.

+ Field attributes determine allowed actions. The REST APIs allow [many actions by default](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create#request-body). For example, all strings are searchable and retrievable. With the REST APIs, you might only use attributes if you need to disable a behavior.

## Load the index

Newly created indexes are empty. To populate an index and make it searchable, you must upload JSON documents that conform to the index schema.

In Azure AI Search, documents serve as both inputs for indexing and outputs for queries. For simplicity, this quickstart provides sample hotel documents as inline JSON. In production scenarios, however, content is often pulled from connected data sources and transformed into JSON using [indexers](../../search-indexer-overview.md).

To upload documents to your index:

1. Paste the following request into your file.

    ```http
    ### Upload documents
    POST {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs/index?api-version=2025-09-01  HTTP/1.1

                }
            }
          ]
        }
    ```

2. Under `### Upload documents`, select **Send Request**.

   You should receive an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response whose body contains the key and status of each uploaded document.

### About the upload request

This quickstart calls [Documents - Index (REST API)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/) to add four sample hotel documents to your index. Compared to the previous request, the URI is extended to include the `docs` collection and `index` operation.

Each document in the `value` array represents a hotel and contains fields that match the index schema. The `@search.action` parameter specifies the operation to perform for each document. Our example uses `upload`, which adds the document if it doesn't exist or updates the document if it does exist.

## Query the index

Now that documents are loaded into your index, you can use full-text search to find specific terms or phrases within their fields.

To run a full-text query against your index:

1. Paste the following request into your file.

    ```http
    ### Run a query
    POST {{baseUrl}}/indexes/hotels-quickstart/docs/search?api-version=2025-09-01  HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
    
      {
          "search": "attached restaurant",
          "select": "HotelId, HotelName, Tags, Description",
          "searchFields": "Description, Tags",
          "count": true
      }
    ```

2. Under `### Run a query`, select **Send Request**.

   You should receive an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response similar to the following example, which shows one matching hotel document, its relevance score, and its selected fields.

    ```json
    {
      "@odata.context": "https://my-service.search.windows.net/indexes('hotels-quickstart')/$metadata#docs(*)",
      "@odata.count": 1,
      "value": [
        {
          "@search.score": 0.5575875,
          "HotelId": "3",
          "HotelName": "Gastronomic Landscape Hotel",
          "Description": "The Gastronomic Hotel stands out for its culinary excellence under the management of William Dough, who advises on and oversees all of the Hotel\u2019s restaurant services.",
          "Tags": [
            "restaurant",
            "bar",
            "continental breakfast"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### About the query request

This quickstart calls [Documents - Search Post (REST API)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post) to find hotel documents that match your search criteria. The URI now targets the `/docs/search` operation.

Full-text search requests always include a `search` parameter that contains the query text. The query text can include one or more terms, phrases, or operators. In addition to `search`, you can specify other parameters to refine the search behavior and results.

Our query searches for the terms "attached restaurant" in the `Description` and `Tags` fields of each hotel document. The `select` parameter limits the fields returned in the response to `HotelId`, `HotelName`, `Tags`, and `Description`. The `count` parameter requests the total number of matching documents.
