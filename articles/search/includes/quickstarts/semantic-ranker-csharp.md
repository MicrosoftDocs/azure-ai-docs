[!INCLUDE [Semantic ranker introduction](semantic-ranker-intro.md)]

## Set up the client

In this quickstart, you use an IDE and the [**Azure.Search.Documents**](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/search.documents-readme) client library to add semantic ranking to an existing search index.

We recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) for this quickstart.

> [!TIP]
> You can [download the source code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/main/quickstart-semantic-search) to start with a finished project or follow these steps to create your own. 

### Install libraries

1. Start Visual Studio and open the [quickstart-semantic-search.sln](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/main/quickstart-semantic-search) or create a new project using a console application template.

1. In **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager**, select **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...**.

1. Select **Browse**.

1. Search for the [Azure.Search.Documents package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Search.Documents/) and select the latest stable version.

1. Search for the [Azure.Identity package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Identity) and select the latest stable version.

1. Select **Install** to add the assembly to your project and solution.

### Sign in to Azure

If you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you're signed into Azure. If you aren't sure, use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to log in: `az login` or `az connect`. If you have multiple tenants and subscriptions, see [Quickstart: Connect without keys](../../search-get-started-rbac.md) for help on how to connect.

## Update the index

In this section, you update a search index to include a semantic configuration. The code gets the index definition from the search service and adds a semantic configuration.

1. Open the [BuildIndex project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/main/quickstart-semantic-search/BuildIndex) in Visual Studio. The program consists of the following code.

   This code uses a SearchIndexClient to update an index on your search service.

    ```csharp
    class BuildIndex
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string searchServiceName = "PUT-YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME-HERE";
            string indexName = "hotels-sample-index";
            string endpoint = $"https://{searchServiceName}.search.windows.net";
            var credential = new Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential();
    
            await ListIndexesAsync(endpoint, credential);
            await UpdateIndexAsync(endpoint, credential, indexName);
        }
    
        // Print a list of all indexes on the search service
        // You should see hotels-sample-index in the list
        static async Task ListIndexesAsync(string endpoint, Azure.Core.TokenCredential credential)
        {
            try
            {
                var indexClient = new Azure.Search.Documents.Indexes.SearchIndexClient(
                    new Uri(endpoint),
                    credential
                );
    
                var indexes = indexClient.GetIndexesAsync();
    
                Console.WriteLine("Here's a list of all indexes on the search service. You should see hotels-sample-index:");
                await foreach (var index in indexes)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(index.Name);
                }
                Console.WriteLine(); // Add an empty line for readability
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error listing indexes: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    
        static async Task UpdateIndexAsync(string endpoint, Azure.Core.TokenCredential credential, string indexName)
        {
            try
            {
                var indexClient = new Azure.Search.Documents.Indexes.SearchIndexClient(
                    new Uri(endpoint),
                    credential
                );
    
                // Get the existing definition of hotels-sample-index
                var indexResponse = await indexClient.GetIndexAsync(indexName);
                var index = indexResponse.Value;
    
                // Add a semantic configuration
                const string semanticConfigName = "semantic-config";
                AddSemanticConfiguration(index, semanticConfigName);
    
                // Update the index with the new information
                var updatedIndex = await indexClient.CreateOrUpdateIndexAsync(index);
                Console.WriteLine("Index updated successfully.");
    
                // Print the updated index definition as JSON
                var refreshedIndexResponse = await indexClient.GetIndexAsync(indexName);
                var refreshedIndex = refreshedIndexResponse.Value;
                var jsonOptions = new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true };
                string indexJson = JsonSerializer.Serialize(refreshedIndex, jsonOptions);
                Console.WriteLine($"Here is the revised index definition:\n{indexJson}");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error updating index: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    
        // This is the semantic configuration definition
        static void AddSemanticConfiguration(SearchIndex index, string semanticConfigName)
        {
            if (index.SemanticSearch == null)
            {
                index.SemanticSearch = new SemanticSearch();
            }
            var configs = index.SemanticSearch.Configurations;
            if (configs == null)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("SemanticSearch.Configurations is null and cannot be assigned. Your service must be Basic tier or higher.");
            }
            if (!configs.Any(c => c.Name == semanticConfigName))
            {
                var prioritizedFields = new SemanticPrioritizedFields
                {
                    TitleField = new SemanticField("HotelName"),
                    ContentFields = { new SemanticField("Description") },
                    KeywordsFields = { new SemanticField("Tags") }
                };
    
                configs.Add(
                    new SemanticConfiguration(
                        semanticConfigName,
                        prioritizedFields
                    )
                );
                Console.WriteLine($"Added new semantic configuration '{semanticConfigName}' to the index definition.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Semantic configuration '{semanticConfigName}' already exists in the index definition.");
            }
            index.SemanticSearch.DefaultConfigurationName = semanticConfigName;
        }
    }
    ```

1. Replace the search service URL with a valid endpoint.

1. Run the program.

1. Output is logged to a console window from [Console.WriteLine](/dotnet/api/system.console.writeline). You should see messages for each step, including the JSON of the index schema with the new semantic configuration included.

## Run semantic queries

In this section, the program runs several semantic queries in sequence.

1. Open the [QueryIndex project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/main/quickstart-semantic-search/QueryIndex) in Visual Studio. The program consists of the following code.

   This code uses a SearchClient for sending queries to an index.

    ```csharp
    class SemanticQuery
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string searchServiceName = "PUT-YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME-HERE";
            string indexName = "hotels-sample-index";
            string endpoint = $"https://{searchServiceName}.search.windows.net";
            var credential = new Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential();
    
            var client = new SearchClient(new Uri(endpoint), indexName, credential);
    
            // Query 1: Simple query
            string searchText = "walking distance to live music";
            Console.WriteLine("\nQuery 1: Simple query using the search string 'walking distance to live music'.");
            await RunQuery(client, searchText, new SearchOptions
            {
                Size = 5,
                QueryType = SearchQueryType.Simple,
                IncludeTotalCount = true,
                Select = { "HotelId", "HotelName", "Description" }
            });
            Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to continue to the next query...");
            Console.ReadLine();

            Console.WriteLine("\nQuery 2: Semantic query (no captions, no answers) for 'walking distance to live music'.");
            var semanticOptions = new SearchOptions
            {

                Select = { "HotelId", "HotelName", "Description" }
            };
            await RunQuery(client, searchText, semanticOptions);
            Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to continue to the next query...");
            Console.ReadLine();
    
            // Query 3: Semantic query with captions
            Console.WriteLine("\nQuery 3: Semantic query with captions.");
            var captionsOptions = new SearchOptions
            {
                Size = 5,
                QueryType = SearchQueryType.Semantic,
                SemanticSearch = new SemanticSearchOptions
                {
                    SemanticConfigurationName = "semantic-config",
                    QueryCaption = new QueryCaption(QueryCaptionType.Extractive)
                    {
                        HighlightEnabled = true
                    }
                },
                IncludeTotalCount = true,

            captionsOptions.HighlightFields.Add("Description");
            await RunQuery(client, searchText, captionsOptions, showCaptions: true);
            Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to continue to the next query...");
            Console.ReadLine();
    
            // Query 4: Semantic query with answers
            // This query uses different search text designed for an answers scenario
            string searchText2 = "what's a good hotel for people who like to read";
            searchText = searchText2; // Update searchText for the next query
            Console.WriteLine("\nQuery 4: Semantic query with a verbatim answer from the Description field for 'what's a good hotel for people who like to read'.");
            var answersOptions = new SearchOptions

### Output for semantic answers

The final query returns a semantic answer. Notice that we changed the query string for this example: 'what's a good hotel for people who like to read'.

Semantic ranker can produce an answer to a query string that has the characteristics of a question. The generated answer is extracted verbatim from your content so it won't include composed content like what you might expect from a chat completion model. If the semantic answer isn't useful for your scenario, you can omit `semantic_answers` from your code.

To produce a semantic answer, the question and answer must be closely aligned, and the model must find content that clearly answers the question. If potential answers fail to meet a confidence threshold, the model doesn't return an answer. For demonstration purposes, the question in this example is designed to get a response so that you can see the syntax.

Recall that answers are *verbatim content* pulled from your index and might be missing phrases that a user would expect to see. To get *composed answers* as generated by a chat completion model, considering using a [RAG pattern](../../retrieval-augmented-generation-overview.md) or [agentic retrieval](../../agentic-retrieval-overview.md).
