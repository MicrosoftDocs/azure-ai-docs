[!INCLUDE [Semantic ranker introduction](semantic-ranker-intro.md)]

## Set up the client

In this quickstart, you use a REST client and the [Azure AI Search REST APIs](/rest/api/searchservice) to configure and use a semantic ranker.

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with a [REST client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) for this quickstart.

> [!TIP]
> You can [download the source code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/tree/main/Quickstart-semantic-search) to start with a finished project or follow these steps to create your own. 

1. Start Visual Studio Code and open the [semantic-search-index-update.rest](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/blob/main/Quickstart-semantic-search/semantic-search-index-update.rest) file or create a new file.

1. At the top, set environment variables for your search service, authorization, and index name.

   + For @searchURL, sign in to the Azure portal and copy the URL from the search service **Overview** page.

   + For @personalAccessToken, follow the instructions in [Connect without keys](../../search-get-started-rbac.md) to get your personal access token.

1. To test the connection, send your first request.

   ```http
   ### List existing indexes by name (verify the connection)
    GET  {{searchUrl}}/indexes?api-version=2025-08-01-preview&$select=name  HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer {{personalAccessToken}}
   ```

1. Select **Sent request**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/search-get-started-semantic/visual-studio-code-send-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the REST client send request link.":::

1. Output for this GET request returns a list of existing indexes. You should get an HTTP 200 Success status code and a list of indexes, including hotels-sample-index used in this quickstart.

## Update the index

To update an index using the REST API, you must provide the entire schema, plus the modifications you want to make. This request provides hotels-sample-index schema, plus the semantic configuration. The modification consists of the following JSON.

```json
"semantic": {
   "configurations": [
   {
      "name": "semantic-config",
      "flightingOptIn": false,
      "rankingOrder": "BoostedRerankerScore",
      "prioritizedFields": {
         "titleField": { "fieldName": "HotelName" },
         "prioritizedContentFields": [{ "fieldName": "Description" }],
         "prioritizedKeywordsFields": [{ "fieldName": "Tags" }]
      }
   }
   ]
}
```

1. Formulate a POST request specifying the index name, operation, and full JSON schema. All required elements of the schema must be present. This request includes the full schema for hotels-sample-index plus the semantic configuration.

    ```http
    POST  {{searchUrl}}/indexes?api-version=2025-08-01-preview  HTTP/1.1

1. Select **Sent request**.

1. Output for this POST request is an HTTP 200 Success status message.

## Run semantic queries

Required semantic parameters include `query_type` and `semantic_configuration_name`. Here's an example of a basic semantic query using the minimum parameters.

1. Open the [semantic-search-query.rest](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-rest-samples/blob/main/Quickstart-semantic-search/semantic-search-query.rest) file or create a new file.

1. At the top of the file, set environment variables for your search service, authorization, and index name.

   + For @searchURL, sign in to the Azure portal and copy the URL from the search service **Overview** page.

   + For @personalAccessToken, follow the instructions in [Connect without keys](../../search-get-started-rbac.md) to get your personal access token.

1. Test the connection with a GET request that returns the hotels-sample-index.

    ```http
    GET  {{searchUrl}}/indexes/hotels-sample-index?api-version=2025-08-01-preview  HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer {{personalAccessToken}}
    ```

1. Send a query that includes the semantic query type and configuration name.

   ```http
    POST {{searchUrl}}/indexes/hotels-sample-index/docs/search?api-version=2025-08-01-preview  HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer {{personalAccessToken}}
    
    {
      "search": "walking distance to live music",
      "select": "HotelId, HotelName, Description",
      "count": true,
      "top": 7,
      "queryType": "simple"
    }
   ```

1. Output consists of JSON search results. Thirteen hotels match the query. The top seven are included in this example.

    ```

### Return captions

Optionally, you can add captions to extract portions of the text and apply hit highlighting to the important terms and phrases. This query adds captions that include hit highlighting.

1. Add the `captions` parameter and send the request.

    ```http
    POST {{searchUrl}}/indexes/hotels-sample-index/docs/search?api-version=2025-08-01-preview  HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer {{personalAccessToken}}
    
    {
      "search": "walking distance to live music",
      "select": "HotelId, HotelName, Description",
      "count": true,
      "queryType": "semantic",
      "semanticConfiguration": "semantic-config",
      "captions": "extractive|highlight-true"
    }
    ```

1. Output consists of the same results, with the addition of `"@search.captions"`. Here's the JSON for a single document. Each match includes search scores, captions in plain text and highlight formatting, and the select fields.

   ```json
   {
      "@search.score": 5.074317,
      "@search.rerankerScore": 2.613231658935547,
      "@search.captions": [
        {
          "text": "Chic hotel near the city. High-rise hotel in downtown, within walking distance to theaters, art galleries, restaurants and shops. Visit Seattle Art Museum by day, and then head over to Benaroya Hall to catch the evening's concert performance.",
          "highlights": "Chic hotel near the city. High-rise hotel in downtown, within walking distance to<em> theaters, </em>art galleries, restaurants and shops. Visit<em> Seattle Art Museum </em>by day, and then head over to<em> Benaroya Hall </em>to catch the evening's concert performance."
        }
      ],
      "HotelId": "24",
      "HotelName": "Uptown Chic Hotel",
      "Description": "Chic hotel near the city. High-rise hotel in downtown, within walking distance to theaters, art galleries, restaurants and shops. Visit Seattle Art Museum by day, and then head over to Benaroya Hall to catch the evening's concert performance."
   }
   ```

### Return semantic answers

In this final query, return semantic answers.

Semantic ranker can produce an answer to a query string that has the characteristics of a question. The generated answer is extracted verbatim from your content so it won't include composed content like what you might expect from a chat completion model. If the semantic answer isn't useful for your scenario, you can omit `semantic_answers` from your code.

To produce a semantic answer, the question and answer must be closely aligned, and the model must find content that clearly answers the question. If potential answers fail to meet a confidence threshold, the model doesn't return an answer. For demonstration purposes, the question in this example is designed to get a response so that you can see the syntax.

1. Formulate the request using a search string that asks a question.

    ```http
    POST {{searchUrl}}/indexes/hotels-sample-index/docs/search?api-version=2025-08-01-preview  HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer {{personalAccessToken}}
    
    {
      "search": "what's a good hotel for people who like to read",
      "select": "HotelId, HotelName, Description",
      "count": true,
      "queryType": "semantic",
      "semanticConfiguration": "semantic-config"
      "answers": "extractive"
    }
    ```

1. Output consists of 41 results for the new query, with "@search.answers" for the question in the query about hotels for people who like to read.

   Recall that answers are *verbatim content* pulled from your index and might be missing phrases that a user would expect to see. To get *composed answers* as generated by a chat completion model, considering using a [RAG pattern](../../retrieval-augmented-generation-overview.md) or [agentic retrieval](../../agentic-retrieval-overview.md).

   In this example, the answer is considered as a strong fit for the question. 

    ```json
    {
      "@odata.count": 41,
      "@search.answers": [
        {
          "key": "38",
