[!INCLUDE [Semantic ranker introduction](semantic-ranker-intro.md)]

## Set up the client

In this quickstart, use a Jupyter notebook and the [**azure-search-documents**](/python/api/overview/azure/search-documents-readme) library in the Azure SDK for Python to learn about semantic ranking.

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with Python 3.10 or later and the [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) for this quickstart.

> [!TIP]
> You can [download a finished notebook](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/main/Quickstart-Semantic-Search) to start with a finished project or follow these steps to create your own. 

We recommend a virtual environment for this quickstart:

1. Start Visual Studio Code.

1. Open the **semantic-search-quickstart.ipynb** file or create a new notebook.

1. Open the Command Palette by using **Ctrl+Shift+P**.

1. Search for **Python: Create Environment**.

1. Select **`Venv.`**

1. Select a Python interpreter. Choose 3.10 or later.

It can take a minute to set up. If you run into problems, see [Python environments in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).

### Install packages and set environment variables

1. Install packages, including [azure-search-documents](/python/api/azure-search-documents). 

    ```python
   ! pip install -r requirements.txt --quiet
    ```

1. Rename `sample.env` to `.env`, and provide your search service endpoint. You can get the endpoint from the Azure portal on the search service **Overview** page.

    ```python
    AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://your-search-service.search.windows.net
    AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME=hotels-sample-index
    ```

### Sign in to Azure

If you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you're signed into Azure. If you aren't sure, use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to log in: `az login` or `az connect`. If you have multiple tenants and subscriptions, see [Quickstart: Connect without keys](../../search-get-started-rbac.md) for help on how to connect.

## Update the index

In this section, you update a search index to include a semantic configuration. The code gets the index definition from the search service and adds a semantic configuration.

1. Open the [semantic-search-quickstart.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/blob/main/Quickstart-Semantic-Search/semantic-search-quickstart.ipynb) file in Visual Studio Code or create a new file.

1. Provide the variables used in the solution.

    ```python
    # Provide variables
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
    import os
    
    load_dotenv(override=True) # Take environment variables from .env.
    
    # The following variables from your .env file are used in this notebook
    search_endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT"]
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://search.azure.com/.default")
    index_name = os.getenv("AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX", "hotels-sample-index")
    ```

1. Create a SearchIndexClient and get the existing hotels-sample-index.

    ```python
    from azure.search.documents.indexes import SearchIndexClient
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    import os
    
    # Initialize the client (similar to what you already have)
    search_endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT"]
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    index_name = "hotels-sample-index"  # or use your existing index_name variable
    
    # Create the SearchIndexClient
    index_client = SearchIndexClient(endpoint=search_endpoint, credential=credential)
    
    try:
        # Get the existing index schema
        index = index_client.get_index(index_name)
        
        print(f"Index name: {index.name}")
        print(f"Number of fields: {len(index.fields)}")
        
        # Print field details
        for field in index.fields:
            print(f"Field: {field.name}, Type: {field.type}, Searchable: {field.searchable}")
        
        # Access semantic configuration if it exists
        if index.semantic_search and index.semantic_search.configurations:
            for config in index.semantic_search.configurations:
                print(f"Semantic config: {config.name}")
                if config.prioritized_fields.title_field:
                    print(f"Title field: {config.prioritized_fields.title_field.field_name}")
        else:
            print("No semantic configuration exists for this index")
    
    except Exception as ex:
        print(f"Error retrieving index: {ex}")
    ```

1. Run the code.

1. Output is the name of the index, list of fields, and a statement indicating whether a semantic configuration exists. For the purposes of this quickstart, the message should say "No semantic configuration exists for this index".

1. Add a semantic configuration to an existing hotels-sample-index on your search service. No search documents are deleted by this operation and your index is still operational after the configuration is added.

    ```python
    # Add semantic configuration to hotels-sample-index and display updated index details
    from azure.search.documents.indexes.models import (
        SemanticConfiguration,
        SemanticField,
        SemanticPrioritizedFields,
        SemanticSearch
    )
    
    try:
        # Get the existing index
        existing_index = index_client.get_index(index_name)
        
        # Create a new semantic configuration
        new_semantic_config = SemanticConfiguration(
            name="semantic-config",
            prioritized_fields=SemanticPrioritizedFields(
                title_field=SemanticField(field_name="HotelName"),
                keywords_fields=[SemanticField(field_name="Tags")],
                content_fields=[SemanticField(field_name="Description")]
            )
        )
        
        # Add semantic configuration to the index
        if existing_index.semantic_search is None:
            existing_index.semantic_search = SemanticSearch(configurations=[new_semantic_config])
        else:
            # Check if configuration already exists
            config_exists = any(config.name == "semantic-config" 
                              for config in existing_index.semantic_search.configurations)
            if not config_exists:
                existing_index.semantic_search.configurations.append(new_semantic_config)
        
        # Update the index
        result = index_client.create_or_update_index(existing_index)
        
        # Get the updated index and display detailed information
        updated_index = index_client.get_index(index_name)
        
        print("Semantic configurations:")
        print("-" * 40)
        if updated_index.semantic_search and updated_index.semantic_search.configurations:
            for config in updated_index.semantic_search.configurations:
                print(f"  Configuration: {config.name}")
                if config.prioritized_fields.title_field:
                    print(f"    Title field: {config.prioritized_fields.title_field.field_name}")
                if config.prioritized_fields.keywords_fields:
                    keywords = [kf.field_name for kf in config.prioritized_fields.keywords_fields]
                    print(f"    Keywords fields: {', '.join(keywords)}")
                if config.prioritized_fields.content_fields:
                    content = [cf.field_name for cf in config.prioritized_fields.content_fields]
                    print(f"    Content fields: {', '.join(content)}")
                print()
        else:
            print("  No semantic configurations found")
        
        print("✅ Semantic configuration successfully added!")
        
    except Exception as ex:
        print(f"❌ Error adding semantic configuration: {ex}")
    ```
    
1. Run the code.

1. Output is the semantic configuration you just added.

## Run semantic queries

Once the index has a semantic configuration, you can run queries that include semantic parameters.

1. Create a SearchClient and a query request that includes the semantic query type and the semantic configuration. This is the minimum requirement for invoking semantic ranking.

    ```python
    # Set up the search client
    search_client = SearchClient(endpoint=search_endpoint,
                          index_name=index_name,
                          credential=credential)
    
    # Runs a semantic query (runs a BM25-ranked query, rescoring and promoting the most semantically relevant matches to the top)
    results =  search_client.search(query_type='semantic', semantic_configuration_name='semantic-config',
        search_text="walking distance to live music", 
        select='HotelId,HotelName,Description', query_caption='extractive')
    
    for result in results:
        print(result["@search.reranker_score"])
        print(result["HotelId"])
        print(result["HotelName"])
        print(f"Description: {result['Description']}")
    ```

1. Run the code.

1. Output should consist of 13 documents, ordered by the `"@search.reranker_score"`.

### Return captions

Optionally, you can add captions to extract portions of the text and apply hit highlighting to the important terms and phrases. This query adds captions.

1. Add `captions` to the query.

    ```python
    # Runs a semantic query that returns captions
    results =  search_client.search(query_type='semantic', semantic_configuration_name='semantic-config',
        search_text="walking distance to live music", 
        select='HotelName,HotelId,Description', query_caption='extractive')
    
    for result in results:
        print(result["@search.reranker_score"])
        print(result["HotelId"])
        print(result["HotelName"])
        print(f"Description: {result['Description']}")
    
        captions = result["@search.captions"]
        if captions:
            caption = captions[0]
            if caption.highlights:
                print(f"Caption: {caption.highlights}\n")
            else:
                print(f"Caption: {caption.text}\n")
    ```

1. Run the code.

1. Output should include a new caption element alongside search field. Captions are the most relevant passages in a  result. If your index includes larger chunks of text, a caption is helpful for extracting the most interesting sentences.

    ```bash
    2.613231658935547

    Caption: Chic hotel near the city. High-rise hotel in downtown, within walking distance to<em> theaters, </em>art galleries, restaurants and shops. Visit<em> Seattle Art Museum </em>by day, and then head over to<em> Benaroya Hall </em>to catch the evening's concert performance.
    ```

### Return semantic answers

In this final query, return semantic answers.

Semantic ranker can produce an answer to a query string that has the characteristics of a question. The generated answer is extracted verbatim from your content so it won't include composed content like what you might expect from a chat completion model. If the semantic answer isn't useful for your scenario, you can omit `semantic_answers` from your code.

To produce a semantic answer, the question and answer must be closely aligned, and the model must find content that clearly answers the question. If potential answers fail to meet a confidence threshold, the model doesn't return an answer. For demonstration purposes, the question in this example is designed to get a response so that you can see the syntax.

1. Add `answers` to the query.

    ```python
    # Run a semantic query that returns semantic answers  
    results =  search_client.search(query_type='semantic', semantic_configuration_name='semantic-config',
     search_text="what's a good hotel for people who like to read",
     select='HotelName,Description,Category', query_caption='extractive', query_answer="extractive",)
    
    semantic_answers = results.get_answers()
    for answer in semantic_answers:
        if answer.highlights:
            print(f"Semantic Answer: {answer.highlights}")
        else:
            print(f"Semantic Answer: {answer.text}")
        print(f"Semantic Answer Score: {answer.score}\n")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result["@search.reranker_score"])
        print(result["HotelName"])
        print(f"Description: {result['Description']}")
    
        captions = result["@search.captions"]
        if captions:
            caption = captions[0]
            if caption.highlights:
                print(f"Caption: {caption.highlights}\n")
            else:
                print(f"Caption: {caption.text}\n")
    ```

1. Run the code.

1. Output should look similar to the following example, where the best answer to question is pulled from one of the results.

    Recall that answers are *verbatim content* pulled from your index and might be missing phrases that a user would expect to see. To get *composed answers* as generated by a chat completion model, considering using a [RAG pattern](../../retrieval-augmented-generation-overview.md) or [agentic retrieval](../../agentic-retrieval-overview.md).
