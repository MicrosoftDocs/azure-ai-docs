## Clone the notebook and setup environment

Instructions on how to clone the notebook.

1. Clone ...

1. Rename the `sample.env` file to `.env`

1. In Visual Studio Code, work in an environment by opening the Command Palette ...

1. Open the Terminal and run the command:

   ```bash
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the `vector-search-quickstart.ipynb`.

   > [!Note]
   > If this is the first time you have used a notebook in Visual Studio Code, you will be prompted to install the Jupyter Notebook kernal and other tool. Choose to install the suggested tools to continue with this tutorial.

1. Run the first cell, you should get output below it ...

   ```output
   Stuff goes here
   ```

## Create a vector index

The code in the `vector-search-quickstart.ipynb` uses several methods from the `azure.search.documents` library to create the vector index and searchable fields.

1. Run the cell in the section below the title "Create an index". If the index is created successfully, you see the following result  below the cell:

   ```output
   vector-search-quickstart created
   ```

Key takeaways when creating vector index with the `azure.search.documents`:

- Take away 1

- Take away 2

## Upload documents

Creating and loading the index are separate steps. You created the index schema [in the previous step](#create-a-vector-index). Now you need to load documents into the index.
 
In Azure AI Search, the index contains all searchable data and queries run on the search service. .

1. In Visual Studio Code, run the cell in the section below "Create documents payload". This cell loads a variable named `documents` with a JSON object describing each document, along with the vectorized version of the article's description. This vector is what powers the search.

1. Run the cell in the section below "Upload the documents". This creates an instance of the search client by calling the `SearchClient()` constructor, then calls the `upload_documents()` method on the object. The status of each document is printed below the cell:

   ```output
   Key: 1, Succeeded: True, ErrorMessage: None
   Key: 2, Succeeded: True, ErrorMessage: None
   Key: 3, Succeeded: True, ErrorMessage: None
   Key: 4, Succeeded: True, ErrorMessage: None
   Key: 48, Succeeded: True, ErrorMessage: None
   Key: 49, Succeeded: True, ErrorMessage: None
   Key: 13, Succeeded: True, ErrorMessage: None
   ```

Key takeaways about the `upload_documents()` method:

- Takeaway 1

- Vector fields contain floating point values. The dimensions attribute has a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3,072 floating point values each. This quickstart sets the dimensions attribute to 1,536 because that's the size of embeddings generated by the Azure OpenAI **text-embedding-ada-002** model.

## Run queries

Now that documents are loaded, you can issue vector queries against them by calling `search_client.search()` and passing in a VectorizedQuery object, the fields you want returned, the number of results, and so on.

In the next sections, we run queries against the `hotels-vector-quickstart` index. The queries include:

- [Single vector search](#single-vector-search)
- [Single vector search with filter](#single-vector-search-with-filter)
- [Hybrid search](#hybrid-search)
- [Semantic hybrid search with filter](#semantic-hybrid-search-with-a-filter)

### Create the vector query string

The example vector queries are based on two strings:

- **Search string**: `historic hotel walk to restaurants and shopping`
- **Vector query string** (vectorized into a mathematical representation): `classic lodging near running trails, eateries, retail`

The vector query string is semantically similar to the search string, but it includes terms that don't exist in the search index. If you do a keyword search for `classic lodging near running trails, eateries, retail`, results are zero. We use this example to show how you can get relevant results even if there are no matching terms.

1. Run the cell in the section below "Create the vector query string". this loads the `vector` variable with the vectorized query data required to run all of the searches in the next sections.

### Single vector search

The first example demonstrates a basic scenario where you want to find document descriptions that closely match the search string.

1. Run the cell below the section called "Single vector search".

1. Find the `### Run a single vector query` code block in the file. This block contains the request to query the search index.


    ```python
   # IMPORTANT: Before you run this code, make sure the documents were successfully
   # created in the previous step. Sometimes it may take a few seconds for the index to be ready.
   # Check the "Document count" for the index in the Azure portal.
   
   # Execute vector search
   if vector:
       try:
           vector_query = VectorizedQuery(
               vector=vector,
               k_nearest_neighbors=5,
               fields="DescriptionVector",
               kind="vector",
               exhaustive=True
           )

           results = search_client.search(
               vector_queries=[vector_query],
               select=["HotelId", "HotelName", "Description", "Category", "Tags"],
               top=5,
               include_total_count=True
           )
   
           print(f"Total results: {results.get_count()}")
           for result in results:
               doc = result  # result is a dict-like object
               print(f"- HotelId: {doc['HotelId']}, HotelName: {doc['HotelName']}, Category: {doc.get('Category')}")
       except Exception as ex:
           print("Vector search failed:", ex)
   else:
       print("No vector loaded, skipping search.")

    ```

    This vector query is shortened for brevity. The `vectorQueries.vector` contains the vectorized text of the query input, `fields` determines which vector fields are searched, and `k` specifies the number of nearest neighbors to return.

    The vector query string is `classic lodging near running trails, eateries, retail`, which is vectorized into 1,536 embeddings for this query.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The code in this example isn't runnable. Several characters or lines are removed for brevity. Use the code in your `az-search-vector-quickstart.rest` file to run the request.

1. Select **Send request**. You should have an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response. The response body should include the JSON representation of the search results.

The response for the vector equivalent of `classic lodging near running trails, eateries, retail` includes seven results. Each result provides a search score and the fields listed in `select`. In a similarity search, the response always includes `k` results ordered by the value similarity score.

   ```output
   Total results: 5
   - HotelId: 48, HotelName: Nordick's Valley Motel, Category: Boutique
   - HotelId: 13, HotelName: Luxury Lion Resort, Category: Luxury
   - HotelId: 4, HotelName: Sublime Palace Hotel, Category: Boutique
   - HotelId: 49, HotelName: Swirling Currents Hotel, Category: Suite
   - HotelId: 2, HotelName: Old Century Hotel, Category: Boutique
   ```

### Single vector search with filter

You can add filters, but the filters are applied to the nonvector content in your index. In this example, the filter applies to the `Tags` field to filter out any hotels that don't provide free Wi-Fi.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the `az-search-vector-quickstart.rest` file you [created earlier](#create-or-download-the-code-file).

1. Find the `### Run a vector query with a filter` code block in the file. This block contains the request to query the search index.


    ```python
   if vector:
       try:
           vector_query = VectorizedQuery(
               vector=vector,
               k_nearest_neighbors=5,
               fields="DescriptionVector",
               kind="vector",
               exhaustive=True
           )
   
           results = search_client.search(
               vector_queries=[vector_query],
               filter="Tags/any(tag: tag eq 'free wifi')",  # <--- NOTICE THE FILTER IS ADDED HERE
               select=["HotelId", "HotelName", "Description", "Category", "Tags"],
               top=7,
               include_total_count=True
           )
   
           print(f"Total filtered results: {results.get_count()}")
           for result in results:
               doc = result
               print(f"- HotelId: {doc['HotelId']}, HotelName: {doc['HotelName']}, Tags: {doc.get('Tags')}")
       except Exception as ex:
           print("Vector search with filter failed:", ex)
   else:
       print("No vector loaded, skipping search.")
    ``` 

   ```output
   Total filtered results: 2
   - HotelId: 48, HotelName: Nordick's Valley Motel, Tags: ['continental breakfast', 'air conditioning', 'free wifi']
   - HotelId: 2, HotelName: Old Century Hotel, Tags: ['pool', 'free wifi', 'air conditioning', 'concierge']
   ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The code in this example isn't runnable. Several characters or lines are removed for brevity. Use the code in your `az-search-vector-quickstart.rest` file to run the request.

1. Select **Send request**. You should have an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response. The response body should include the JSON representation of the search results.

The query was the same as the previous [single vector search example](#single-vector-search), but it includes a post-processing exclusion filter and returns only the three hotels that have free Wi-Fi.

   ```python
   if vector:
      try:
         vector_query = VectorizedQuery(
         vector=vector,
         k_nearest_neighbors=5,
         fields="DescriptionVector",
         kind="vector",
         exhaustive=True
      )
   
      results = search_client.search(
         include_total_count=True,
         top=5,
         select=[
             "HotelId", "HotelName", "Category", "Description", "Address/City", "Address/StateProvince"
         ],
         facets=["Address/StateProvince"],
         filter="geo.distance(Location, geography'POINT(-77.03241 38.90166)') le 300",
         vector_filter_mode="postFilter",
         vector_queries=[vector_query]
      )
   
      print(f"Total semantic hybrid results: {results.get_count()}")
      for result in results:
         doc = result
         score = result.get("@search.score", "N/A")
         print(f"- HotelId: {doc['HotelId']}")
         print(f"  HotelName: {doc['HotelName']}")
         print(f"  Score: {score}")
         print(f"  City/State: {doc['Address']['City']}, {doc['Address']['StateProvince']}")
         print(f"  Description: {doc.get('Description')}\n")

      except Exception as ex:
         print("Semantic hybrid search failed:", ex)
   else:
      print("No vector loaded, skipping search.")
   ```

   ```output

### Hybrid search

Hybrid search consists of keyword queries and vector queries in a single search request. This example runs the vector query and full text search concurrently:

- **Search string**: `historic hotel walk to restaurants and shopping`
- **Vector query string** (vectorized into a mathematical representation): `classic lodging near running trails, eateries, retail`

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the `az-search-vector-quickstart.rest` file you [created earlier](#create-or-download-the-code-file).

1. Find the `### Run a hybrid query` code block in the file. This block contains the request to query the search index.


   ```python
   if vector:
       try:
           vector_query = VectorizedQuery(
               vector=vector,
               k_nearest_neighbors=5,
               fields="DescriptionVector",
               kind="vector",
               exhaustive=True
           )

           results = search_client.search(
               include_total_count=True,
               search_text="historic hotel walk to restaurants and shopping",  # keyword part
               select=["HotelId", "HotelName", "Description", "Category", "Tags"],
               top=5,
               vector_queries=[vector_query]
           )
   
           print(f"Total hybrid results: {results.get_count()}")
           for result in results:
               doc = result

Because RRF merges results, it helps to review the inputs. The following results are from only the full-text query. The top two results are Sublime Palace Hotel and History Lion Resort. The Sublime Palace Hotel has a stronger BM25 relevance score.

```json
{
    "@search.score": 2.2626662,
    "HotelName": "Sublime Palace Hotel",
    "Description": "Sublime Palace Hotel is located in the heart of the historic center of Sublime in an extremely vibrant and lively area within short walking distance to the sites and landmarks of the city and is surrounded by the extraordinary beauty of churches, buildings, shops and monuments.

    "Description": "Unmatched Luxury.  Visit our downtown hotel to indulge in luxury accommodations. Moments from the stadium, we feature the best in comfort"
},
```

In the vector-only query, which uses HNSW for finding matches, the Sublime Palace Hotel drops to fourth position. Historic Lion, which was second in the full-text search and third in the vector search, doesn't experience the same range of fluctuation, so it appears as a top match in a homogenized result set.

### Semantic hybrid search with a filter

Here's the last query in the collection. This hybrid query with semantic ranking is filtered to show only the hotels within a 500-kilometer radius of Washington D.C. You can set `vectorFilterMode` to null, which is equivalent to the default (`preFilter` for newer indexes and `postFilter` for older ones).

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the `az-search-vector-quickstart.rest` file you [created earlier](#create-or-download-the-code-file).

1. Find the `### Run a hybrid query with semantic reranking` code block in the file. This block contains the request to query the search index.

   ```python
   if semantic_hybrid_query_vector:
      try:
         vector_query = VectorizedQuery(
            vector=vector,
            k_nearest_neighbors=5,
            fields="DescriptionVector",
            kind="vector",
            exhaustive=True
         )

         results = search_client.search(
            include_total_count=True,
            search_text="historic hotel walk to restaurants and shopping",
            select=[

            top=7,            
            vector_queries=[vector_query]
         )

         print(f"Total semantic hybrid results: {results.get_count()}")
         for result in results:
            doc = result
            score = result.get("@search.score", "N/A")
            reranker_score = result.get("@search.reranker_score", "N/A")

   ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The code in this example isn't runnable. Several characters or lines are removed for brevity. Use the code in your `az-search-vector-quickstart.rest` file to run the request.

1. Select **Send request**. You should have an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response. The response body should include the JSON representation of the search results.

Review the response. The response is three hotels, which are filtered by location and faceted by `StateProvince` and semantically reranked to promote results that are closest to the search string query (`historic hotel walk to restaurants and shopping`).

The Swirling Currents Hotel now moves into the top spot. Without semantic ranking, Nordick's Valley Motel is number one. With semantic ranking, the machine comprehension models recognize that `historic` applies to "hotel, within walking distance to dining (restaurants) and shopping."

Key takeaways about [Documents - Search Post](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post) REST API:

- Vector search is specified through the `vectors.value` property. Keyword search is specified through the `search` property.

- In a hybrid search, you can integrate vector search with full-text search over keywords. Filters, spell check, and semantic ranking apply to textual content only, and not vectors. In this final query, there's no semantic `answer` because the system didn't produce one that was sufficiently strong.

- Actual results include more detail, including semantic captions and highlights. Results were modified for readability. To get the full structure of the response, run the request in the REST client.

## Clean up

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can find and manage resources in the Azure portal by using the **All resources** or **Resource groups** link in the leftmost pane.

If you want to keep the search service, but delete the index and documents, you can use the `DELETE` command in the REST client. This command (at the end of your `az-search-vector-quickstart.rest` file) deletes the `hotels-vector-quickstart` index:

```python
index_client.delete_index(index_name)
print(f"Index '{index_name}' deleted successfully.")
```
