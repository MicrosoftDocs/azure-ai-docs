[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](../previews/preview-generic.md)]

In this quickstart, you use [agentic retrieval](../../search-agentic-retrieval-concept.md) to create a conversational search experience powered by large language models (LLMs) and your proprietary data. Agentic retrieval breaks down complex user queries into subqueries, runs the subqueries in parallel, and extracts grounding data from documents indexed in Azure AI Search. The output is intended for integration with agentic and custom chat solutions.

Although you can provide your own data, this quickstart uses [sample JSON documents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/tree/main/nasa-e-book/earth-at-night-json) from NASA's Earth at Night e-book. The documents describe general science topics and images of Earth at night as observed from space.

This quickstart is based on the [Quickstart-Agentic-Retrieval](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/main/Quickstart-Agentic-Retrieval) Jupyter notebook on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

+ An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

+ An [Azure AI Search service](../../search-create-service-portal.md) on the Basic tier or higher with [semantic ranker enabled](../../semantic-how-to-enable-disable.md).

+ An [Azure AI Foundry project](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects). You get an Azure AI Foundry resource (that you need for model deployments) when you create an Azure AI Foundry project.

+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter package](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/).

+ The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.

[!INCLUDE [Setup](./agentic-retrieval-setup.md)]

## Connect from your local system

You configured role-based access to interact with Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI. 

To connect from your local system:

1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code and change to the directory where you want to save your files.
1. Run the following Azure CLI command and sign in with your Azure account. If you have multiple subscriptions, select the one that contains your Azure AI Search service and Azure AI Foundry project.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

For more information, see [Quickstart: Connect without keys](../../search-get-started-rbac.md).

## Install packages and load connections

Before you run any code, install Python packages and define credentials, endpoints, and deployment details for connections to Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI. These values are used in subsequent operations.

To install the packages and load the connections:

1. In Visual Studio Code, create a `.ipynb` file. For example, you can name the file `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb`.

1. In the first code cell, paste the following code to install the required packages. 

    ```Python
    ! pip install azure-search-documents==11.6.0b12 --quiet
    ! pip install azure-identity --quiet
    ! pip install openai --quiet
    ! pip install aiohttp --quiet
    ! pip install ipykernel --quiet
    ! pip install requests --quiet
    ```

    You can run this cell by selecting the **Run Cell** button or pressing `Shift+Enter`.

1. Add another code cell and paste the following import statements and variables.

    ```Python
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
    import os

    endpoint = "PUT YOUR SEARCH SERVICE ENDPOINT HERE"
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://search.azure.com/.default")
    azure_openai_endpoint = "PUT YOUR AZURE AI FOUNDRY ENDPOINT HERE"
    azure_openai_gpt_deployment = "gpt-4.1-mini"
    azure_openai_gpt_model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
    azure_openai_api_version = "2025-03-01-preview"
    azure_openai_embedding_deployment = "text-embedding-3-large"
    azure_openai_embedding_model = "text-embedding-3-large"
    index_name = "earth_at_night"
    agent_name = "earth-search-agent"
    answer_model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
    api_version = "2025-05-01-Preview"
    ```

1. Set `endpoint` to your Azure AI Search endpoint, which looks like `https://<your-search-service-name>.search.windows.net.` Set `azure_openai_endpoint` to your Azure AI Foundry endpoint, which looks like `https://<your-foundry-resource-name>.openai.azure.com.` You obtained both values in the [Get endpoints](#get-endpoints) section. 

1. To verify the variables, run the code cell.

## Create a search index

In Azure AI Search, an index is a structured collection of data. The following code defines an index named `earth_at_night`, which you specified using the `index_name` variable in the previous section.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
from azure.search.documents.indexes.models import SearchIndex, SearchField, VectorSearch, VectorSearchProfile, HnswAlgorithmConfiguration, AzureOpenAIVectorizer, AzureOpenAIVectorizerParameters, SemanticSearch, SemanticConfiguration, SemanticPrioritizedFields, SemanticField
from azure.search.documents.indexes import SearchIndexClient

index = SearchIndex(
    name=index_name,
    fields=[
        SearchField(name="id", type="Edm.String", key=True, filterable=True, sortable=True, facetable=True),
        SearchField(name="page_chunk", type="Edm.String", filterable=False, sortable=False, facetable=False),
        SearchField(name="page_embedding_text_3_large", type="Collection(Edm.Single)", stored=False, vector_search_dimensions=3072, vector_search_profile_name="hnsw_text_3_large"),
        SearchField(name="page_number", type="Edm.Int32", filterable=True, sortable=True, facetable=True)
    ],
    vector_search=VectorSearch(
        profiles=[VectorSearchProfile(name="hnsw_text_3_large", algorithm_configuration_name="alg", vectorizer_name="azure_openai_text_3_large")],
        algorithms=[HnswAlgorithmConfiguration(name="alg")],
        vectorizers=[
            AzureOpenAIVectorizer(
                vectorizer_name="azure_openai_text_3_large",
                parameters=AzureOpenAIVectorizerParameters(
                    resource_url=azure_openai_endpoint,
                    deployment_name=azure_openai_embedding_deployment,
                    model_name=azure_openai_embedding_model
                )
            )
        ]
    ),
    semantic_search=SemanticSearch(
        default_configuration_name="semantic_config",
        configurations=[
            SemanticConfiguration(
                name="semantic_config",
                prioritized_fields=SemanticPrioritizedFields(
                    content_fields=[
                        SemanticField(field_name="page_chunk")
                    ]
                )
            )
        ]
    )
)

index_client = SearchIndexClient(endpoint=endpoint, credential=credential)
index_client.create_or_update_index(index)
print(f"Index '{index_name}' created or updated successfully")
```

The index schema contains fields for document identification and page content, embeddings, and numbers. It also includes configurations for semantic ranking and vector queries, which use the `text-embedding-3-large` model you previously deployed.

## Upload documents to the index

Currently, the `earth_at_night` index is empty. Run the following code to populate the index with JSON documents from [NASA's Earth at Night e-book](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/refs/heads/main/nasa-e-book/earth-at-night-json/documents.json). As required by Azure AI Search, each document conforms to the fields and data types defined in the index schema.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
from azure.search.documents import SearchIndexingBufferedSender
import requests

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/refs/heads/main/nasa-e-book/earth-at-night-json/documents.json"
documents = requests.get(url).json()

with SearchIndexingBufferedSender(endpoint=endpoint, index_name=index_name, credential=credential) as client:
    client.upload_documents(documents=documents)

print(f"Documents uploaded to index '{index_name}'")
```

## Create a knowledge agent

To connect Azure AI Search to your `gpt-4.1-mini` deployment and target the `earth_at_night` index at query time, you need a knowledge agent. The following code defines a knowledge agent named `earth-search-agent`, which you specified using the `agent_name` variable in a previous section.

To ensure relevant and semantically meaningful responses, `default_reranker_threshold` is set to exclude responses with a reranker score of `2.5` or lower.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
from azure.search.documents.indexes.models import KnowledgeAgent, KnowledgeAgentAzureOpenAIModel, KnowledgeAgentTargetIndex, KnowledgeAgentRequestLimits, AzureOpenAIVectorizerParameters

agent = KnowledgeAgent(
    name=agent_name,
    models=[
        KnowledgeAgentAzureOpenAIModel(
            azure_open_ai_parameters=AzureOpenAIVectorizerParameters(
                resource_url=azure_openai_endpoint,
                deployment_name=azure_openai_gpt_deployment,
                model_name=azure_openai_gpt_model
            )
        )
    ],
    target_indexes=[
        KnowledgeAgentTargetIndex(
            index_name=index_name,
            default_reranker_threshold=2.5
        )
    ],
)

index_client.create_or_update_agent(agent)
print(f"Knowledge agent '{agent_name}' created or updated successfully")
```

## Set up messages

The next step is to define the knowledge agent instructions and conversation context using the `messages` array. Each message includes a `role`, such as `user` or `assistant`, and `content` in natural language. A user message represents the query to be processed, while an assistant message guides the knowledge agent on how to respond. During the retrieval process, these messages are sent to an LLM to extract relevant responses from indexed documents.

For now, create the following assistant message, which instructs `earth-search-agent` to answer questions about the Earth at night, cite sources using their `ref_id`, and respond with "I don't know" when answers are unavailable.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
instructions = """
An Q&A agent that can answer questions about the Earth at night.
Sources have a JSON format with a ref_id that must be cited in the answer.
If you do not have the answer, respond with "I don't know".
"""

messages = [
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": instructions
    }
]
```

## Run the retrieval pipeline

You're ready to initiate the agentic retrieval pipeline. The input for this pipeline is the `messages` array, whose conversation history includes the instructions you previously provided and user queries. Additionally, `target_index_params` specifies the index to query and other configurations, such as the semantic ranker threshold.

The following code sends a two-part user query to `earth-search-agent`, which deconstructs the query into subqueries, runs the subqueries against both text fields and vector embeddings in the `earth_at_night` index, and ranks and merges the results. The response is then appended to the `messages` array.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
from azure.search.documents.agent import KnowledgeAgentRetrievalClient
from azure.search.documents.agent.models import KnowledgeAgentRetrievalRequest, KnowledgeAgentMessage, KnowledgeAgentMessageTextContent, KnowledgeAgentIndexParams

agent_client = KnowledgeAgentRetrievalClient(endpoint=endpoint, agent_name=agent_name, credential=credential)

messages.append({
    "role": "user",
    "content": """
    Why do suburban belts display larger December brightening than urban cores even though absolute light levels are higher downtown?
    Why is the Phoenix nighttime street grid is so sharply visible from space, whereas large stretches of the interstate between midwestern cities remain comparatively dim?
    """
})

retrieval_result = agent_client.retrieve(
    retrieval_request=KnowledgeAgentRetrievalRequest(
        messages=[KnowledgeAgentMessage(role=msg["role"], content=[KnowledgeAgentMessageTextContent(text=msg["content"])]) for msg in messages if msg["role"] != "system"],
        target_index_params=[KnowledgeAgentIndexParams(index_name=index_name, reranker_threshold=2.5)]
    )
)
messages.append({
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": retrieval_result.response[0].content[0].text
})
```

### Review the response, activity, and results

Now you want to display the response, activity, and results of the retrieval pipeline.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
import textwrap
import json

print("Response")
print(textwrap.fill(retrieval_result.response[0].content[0].text, width=120))

print("Activity")
print(json.dumps([a.as_dict() for a in retrieval_result.activity], indent=2))

print("Results")
print(json.dumps([r.as_dict() for r in retrieval_result.references], indent=2))
```

The output should be similar to the following example, where:

+ `Response` provides a text string of the most relevant documents (or chunks) in the search index based on the user query. As shown later in this quickstart, you can pass this string to an LLM for answer generation.

+ `Activity` tracks the steps that were taken during the retrieval process, including the subqueries generated by your `gpt-4.1-mini` deployment and the tokens used for query planning and execution.

+ `Results` lists the documents that contributed to the response, each one identified by their `doc_key`.

```

## Create the Azure OpenAI client

To extend the retrieval pipeline from answer *extraction* to answer *generation*, set up the Azure OpenAI client to interact with your `gpt-4.1-mini` deployment, which you specified using the `answer_model` variable in a previous section.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
from openai import AzureOpenAI
from azure.identity import get_bearer_token_provider

azure_openai_token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default")
client = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=azure_openai_endpoint,
    azure_ad_token_provider=azure_openai_token_provider,
    api_version=azure_openai_api_version
)
```

### Use the Responses API to generate an answer

You can now use the Responses API to generate a detailed answer based on the indexed documents. The following code sends the `messages` array, which contains the conversation history, to your `gpt-4.1-mini` deployment.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
response = client.responses.create(
    model=answer_model,
    input=messages
)

wrapped = textwrap.fill(response.output_text, width=100)
print(wrapped)
```

The output should be similar to the following example, which uses the reasoning capabilities of `gpt-4.1-mini` to provide contextually relevant answers.

```
Suburban belts often exhibit larger December brightening than urban cores primarily because of the type of development and light distribution in those areas. Suburbs tend to have more uniform and expansive lighting, making them more visible in nighttime satellite images. In contrast, urban cores, although having higher absolute light levels, often contain dense building clusters that can cause light to be obscured or concentrated in smaller areas, leading to less visible brightening when viewed from space.  Regarding the visibility of the Phoenix nighttime street grid from space, it is attributed to the city's grid layout and the intensity of its street lighting. The grid pattern of the streets and the significant development around them create a stark contrast against less developed areas. Conversely, large stretches of interstate in the Midwest may remain dimmer due to fewer densely populated structures and less intensive street lighting, resulting in less illumination overall.  For more detailed insights, you can refer to the sources: [0] and [1].
```

### Use the Chat Completions API to generate an answer

Alternatively, you can use the Chat Completions API for answer generation.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=answer_model,
    messages=messages
)

wrapped = textwrap.fill(response.choices[0].message.content, width=100)
print(wrapped)
```

The output should be similar to the following example.

```
Suburban belts tend to display larger December brightening than urban cores, despite the absolute light levels being higher in downtown areas, due to the differing density of light sources and how light scatters. In urban cores, the intense concentration of lights may result in a more uniform light distribution that can obscure the brightening effect, whereas suburban areas, with their lower density of lights and more open spaces, allow for clearer visibility of atmospheric light scattering, thus enhancing the brightening effect in those regions.  As for why the Phoenix nighttime street grid is sharply visible from space compared to the dim stretches of the interstate between Midwestern cities, it primarily relates to urban planning and development patterns. The Phoenix metropolitan area is laid out along a regular grid of city blocks that include extensive street lighting, making the urban structure distinctly visible from space. In contrast, the interstates between Midwestern cities often traverse areas with less concentrated development and fewer bright lighting sources, leading to these sections appearing dimmer in nighttime imagery [1; ref_id:1].
```

## Continue the conversation

Continue the conversation by sending another user query to `earth-search-agent`. The following code reruns the retrieval pipeline, fetching relevant content from the `earth_at_night` index and appending the response to the `messages` array. However, unlike before, you can now use the Azure OpenAI client to generate an answer based on the retrieved content.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
messages.append({
    "role": "user",
    "content": "How do I find lava at night?"
})

retrieval_result = agent_client.retrieve(
    retrieval_request=KnowledgeAgentRetrievalRequest(
        messages=[KnowledgeAgentMessage(role=msg["role"], content=[KnowledgeAgentMessageTextContent(text=msg["content"])]) for msg in messages if msg["role"] != "system"],
        target_index_params=[KnowledgeAgentIndexParams(index_name=index_name, reranker_threshold=2.5)]
    )
)
messages.append({
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": retrieval_result.response[0].content[0].text
})
```

### Review the new response, activity, and results

Now you want to display the response, activity, and results of the retrieval pipeline.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
import textwrap
import json

print("Response")
print(textwrap.fill(retrieval_result.response[0].content[0].text, width=120))

print("Activity")
print(json.dumps([a.as_dict() for a in retrieval_result.activity], indent=2))

print("Results")
print(json.dumps([r.as_dict() for r in retrieval_result.references], indent=2))
```

## Generate an LLM-powered answer

Now that you sent multiple user queries, use the Responses API to generate an answer based on the indexed documents and conversation history, which is captured in the `messages` array.

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
response = client.responses.create(
    model=answer_model,
    input=messages
)

wrapped = textwrap.fill(response.output_text, width=100)
print(wrapped)
```

The output should be similar to the following example.

```
To find lava at night, you can look for the following signs:  1. **Active Volcanoes**: Research volcanoes that are currently active. Notable examples include Mount Etna in Italy and Kilauea in Hawaii. Both have had significant eruptions that can be observed at night due to the glow of lava. 2. **Satellite Imagery**: Use satellite imagery, especially those from sources like VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) on the Suomi NPP satellite, which captures nighttime images of active lava flows. During eruptions, lava glows brightly in thermal infrared images, making it detectable from space.  3. **Safe Viewing Locations**: If you’re near an active volcano, find designated viewing areas for safety. Many national parks with volcanoes offer nighttime lava viewing experiences.  4. **Moonlight**: The presence of moonlight can enhance visibility, allowing you to spot lava flows more easily against the backdrop of the dark landscape.  5. **Monitoring Reports**: Follow updates from geological services or local authorities that monitor volcanic activity, which often provide real-time information about eruptions and visible lava flows at night.  6. **Photography**: If you're an enthusiast, consider using long-exposure photography techniques to capture the glow of lava flows at night.  For more information on observing volcanic activity, satellite imagery can provide vital data for detecting lava flows and volcanic eruptions.
```

## Clean up resources

When working in your own subscription, it's a good idea to finish a project by determining whether you still need the resources you created. Resources that are left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually, or you can delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

In the Azure portal, you can find and manage resources by selecting **All resources** or **Resource groups** from the left pane. You can also run the following code to delete the objects you created in this quickstart.

### Delete the knowledge agent

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
index_client = SearchIndexClient(endpoint=endpoint, credential=credential)
index_client.delete_agent(agent_name)
print(f"Knowledge agent '{agent_name}' deleted successfully")
```

### Delete the search index

Add and run a new code cell in the `quickstart-agentic-retrieval.ipynb` notebook with the following code:

```Python
index_client = SearchIndexClient(endpoint=endpoint, credential=credential)
index_client.delete_index(index_name)
print(f"Index '{index_name}' deleted successfully")
```
