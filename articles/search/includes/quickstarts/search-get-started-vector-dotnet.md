In this quickstart, you work with a .NET app to create, populate, and query vectors. The code examples perform these operations by using the [Azure AI Search client library](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/search). The library provides an abstraction over the REST API for access to index operations such as data ingestion, search operations, and index management operations.

In Azure AI Search, a [vector store](../../vector-store.md) has an index schema that defines vector and nonvector fields, a vector search configuration for algorithms that create the embedding space, and settings on vector field definitions that are evaluated at query time. The [Create Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) REST API creates the vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart omits the vectorization step and provides inline embeddings. If you want to add [built-in data chunking and vectorization](../../vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) over your own content, try the [**Import and vectorize data wizard**](../../search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md) for an end-to-end walkthrough.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- An Azure AI Search service. [Create a service](../../search-create-service-portal.md) or [find an existing service](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ProjectOxford/CognitiveServicesHub/~/CognitiveSearch) in your current subscription.
    - You can use a free search service for most of this quickstart, but we recommend the Basic tier or higher for larger data files.
    - To run the query example that invokes [semantic reranking](../../semantic-search-overview.md), your search service must be at the Basic tier or higher with [semantic ranker enabled](../../semantic-how-to-enable-disable.md).

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com).

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone the sample repo.

## Retrieve resource information

Requests to the search endpoint must be authenticated and authorized. While it's possible to use API keys or roles for this task, we recommend [using a keyless connection via Microsoft Entra ID](../../search-get-started-rbac.md).

This quickstart uses `DefaultAzureCredential`, which simplifies authentication in both development and production scenarios. However, for production scenarios, you might have more advanced requirements that require a different approach. See [Authenticate .NET apps to Azure services by using the Azure SDK for .NET](/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/) to understand all of your options.

## Clone the code and setup environment

1. Clone the repo containing the code for this quickstart. 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples
   ```
  
   This repo has .NET code examples for several articles each in a separate subfolder.

1. Open the subfolder `quickstart-Vector-Search` in Visual Studio Code.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the `appsettings.json` files in the `VectorSearchExamples` and `VectorSearchCreateIndexUploadDocs` folders. Update the following values: 

   - `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`: You can find the url in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Go to your Azure AI Search service, on the **Overview** page, look for the URL field. An example endpoint might look like `https://mydemo.search.windows.net`. 
   - `AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME`: Leave the default value provided in the file or enter your own index name.

## Create the vector index and upload documents

To run search queries against the Azure AI Search service, you first need to create a search index and upload documents to the service.

1. Open a new terminal in the `VectorSearchCreatePopulateIndex` folder.

1. Run the project using the `dotnet run` command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

The following code executes to create an index:

<!-- Vector Index code -->
:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-search-dotnet-samples/quickstart-vector-search/vectorsearchcreateindexuploaddocs/program.cs" id="CreateSearchindex":::

The following code uploads the JSON formatted documents in the `hotel-samples.json` file to the Azure AI Search service:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-search-dotnet-samples/quickstart-vector-search/vectorsearchcreateindexuploaddocs/program.cs" id="UploadDocs":::

After you run the projecment is printed below it:

```output
Key: 1, Succeeded: True
Key: 2, Succeeded: True
Key: 3, Succeeded: True
Key: 4, Succeeded: True
Key: 48, Succeeded: True
Key: 49, Succeeded: True
Key: 13, Succeeded: True
```

Key takeaways:

- Your code interacts with a specific search index hosted in your Azure AI Search service through the `SearchClient`, which is the main object provided by the `azure-search-documents` package. The `SearchClient` provides access to index operations such as:

    - **Data ingestion**: `UploadDocuments()`, `MergeDocuments()`, `DeleteDocuments()`
    - **Search operations**: `Search()`, `Autocomplete()`, `Suggest()`
    - **Index management operations**: `CreateOrUpdateIndex`

- Vector fields contain floating point values. The dimensions attribute has a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4096 floating point values each. This size of embeddings generated by the Azure OpenAI **text-embedding-3-small** model for this quickstart is 1536.

## Run search queries

After the index is created and documents are loaded, you can issue vector queries against them by calling `SearchAsync()` with various parameters.

1. In the `VectorSearchExamples` folder, open the `Program.cs` file.
1. Open a new terminal in the `VectorSearchExamples` folder.

In the following sections, you run queries against the `hotels-vector-quickstart` index. The queries include:

- [Single vector search](#single-vector-search)
- [Single vector search with filter](#single-vector-search-with-filter)
- [Hybrid search](#hybrid-search)
- [Semantic hybrid search with filter](#semantic-hybrid-search-with-a-filter)

### Single vector search

The first example demonstrates a basic scenario where you want to find document descriptions that closely match the search string.

1. In the `Program.cs` file of the `VectorSearchExamples` folder, uncomment the method call `SearchExamples.SearchSingleVector(searchClient, vectorizedResult);`. This method executes the following search function in the `SearchExamples.cs` class:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-search-dotnet-samples/quickstart-vector-search/vectorsearchexamples/program.cs" id="SearchSingleVector":::

1. Run the project using the `dotnet run` command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

After you run the project, the search results are printed in the output window:

```output
Single Vector Search Results:
Score: 0.6605852, HotelId: 48, HotelName: Nordick's Valley Motel
Score: 0.6333684, HotelId: 13, HotelName: Luxury Lion Resort
Score: 0.605672, HotelId: 4, HotelName: Sublime Palace Hotel
Score: 0.6026341, HotelId: 49, HotelName: Swirling Currents Hotel
Score: 0.57902366, HotelId: 2, HotelName: Old Century Hotel
```

### Single vector search with filter

You can add filters, but the filters are applied to the nonvector content in your index. In this example, the filter applies to the `Tags` field to filter out any hotels that don't provide free Wi-Fi.

1. In the `Program.cs` file of the `VectorSearchExamples` folder, uncomment the method call `SearchExamples.SearchSingleVectorWithFilter(searchClient, vectorizedResult);`. This method executes the following search function in the `SearchExamples.cs` class:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-search-dotnet-samples/quickstart-vector-search/vectorsearchexamples/program.cs" id="SearchSingleVectorWithFilter":::

1.  Run the project again, and the status of each document is printed below it:

   ```output
    Single Vector Search With Filter Results:
    Score: 0.6605852, HotelId: 48, HotelName: Nordick's Valley Motel, Tags: continental breakfastair conditioningfree wifi
    Score: 0.57902366, HotelId: 2, HotelName: Old Century Hotel, Tags: poolfree wifiair conditioningconcierge
   ```

   The query was the same as the previous [single vector search example](#single-vector-search), but it includes a post-processing exclusion filter and returns only the three hotels that have free Wi-Fi.

1. The next filter example uses a **geo filter**. In the `Program.cs` file of the `VectorSearchExamples` folder, uncomment the method call `SearchExamples.SingleSearchWithGeoFilter(searchClient, vectorizedResult);`. This method executes the following search function in the `SearchExamples.cs` class:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-search-dotnet-samples/quickstart-vector-search/vectorsearchexamples/program.cs" id="SingleSearchWithGeoFilter":::
   
   The query was the same as the previous [single vector search example](#single-vector-search), but it includes a post-processing exclusion filter and returns only the two hotels within 300 kilometers.

1.  Run the project again, and the status of each document is printed below it:
   
   ```output
   Vector query with a geo filter:
   -HotelId: 48
    HotelName: Nordick's Valley Motel
    Score: 0.6605852246284485
    City/State: Washington D.C./null
    Description: Only 90 miles (about 2 hours) from the nation's capital and nearby most everything the historic valley has to offer. Hiking? Wine Tasting? Exploring the caverns?

   -HotelId: 49
    HotelName: Swirling Currents Hotel
    Score: 0.602634072303772
    City/State: Arlington/VA
    Description: Spacious rooms, glamorous suites and residences, rooftop pool, walking access to shopping, dining, entertainment and the city center. Each room comes equipped with a microwave, a coffee maker and a minifridge. In-room entertainment includes complimentary W-Fi and flat-screen TVs.
   ```

### Hybrid search

Hybrid search consists of keyword queries and vector queries in a single search request. This example runs the vector query and full-text search concurrently:

- **Search string**: `historic hotel walk to restaurants and shopping`
- **Vector query string** (vectorized into a mathematical representation): `Quintessential lodging near running trails, eateries, retail`

1. In the `Program.cs` file of the `VectorSearchExamples` folder, uncomment the method call `SearchExamples.SearchHybridVectorAndText(searchClient, vectorizedResult);`. This method executes the following search function in the `SearchExamples.cs` class:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-search-dotnet-samples/quickstart-vector-search/vectorsearchexamples/program.cs" id="SearchHybridVectorAndText":::

1.  Run the project again, and the status of each document is printed below it:

   Review the response:

   ```output

   Because Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) merges results, it helps to review the inputs. The following results are from only the full-text query. The top two results are Sublime Palace Hotel and History Lion Resort. The Sublime Palace Hotel has a stronger BM25 relevance score.

   ```json
   {
       "@search.score": 2.2626662,
       "HotelName": "Sublime Palace Hotel",
       "Description": "Sublime Palace Hotel is located in the heart of the historic center of Sublime in an extremely vibrant and lively area within short walking distance to the sites and landmarks of the city and is surrounded by the extraordinary beauty of churches, buildings, shops and monuments. Sublime Palace is part of a lovingly restored 1800 palace."
   },
   {
       "@search.score": 0.86421645,
       "HotelName": "Luxury Lion Resort",
       "Description": "Unmatched Luxury.  Visit our downtown hotel to indulge in luxury accommodations. Moments from the stadium, we feature the best in comfort"
   },
   ```

   In the vector-only query, which uses HNSW for finding matches, the Sublime Palace Hotel drops to fourth position. Historic Lion, which was second in the full-text search and third in the vector search, doesn't experience the same range of fluctuation, so it appears as a top match in a homogenized result set.

   ]
   ```

### Semantic hybrid search with a filter

The hybrid query with semantic ranking is filtered to show only the hotels within a 500-kilometer radius of Washington D.C.

1. In the `Program.cs` file of the `VectorSearchExamples` folder, uncomment the method call `SearchExamples.SearchHybridVectoryAndSemantic(searchClient, vectorizedResult);`. This method executes the following search function in the `SearchExamples.cs` class:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-search-dotnet-samples/quickstart-vector-search/vectorsearchexamples/program.cs" id="SearchHybridVectoryAndSemantic":::

1.  Run the project again, and the status of each document is printed below it:

   Review the output below the cell. The response is three hotels, which are filtered by location and faceted by `StateProvince` and semantically reranked to promote results that are closest to the search string query (`historic hotel walk to restaurants and shopping`).

   The Swirling Currents Hotel now moves into the top spot. Without semantic ranking, Nordick's Valley Motel is number one. With semantic ranking, the machine comprehension models recognize that `historic` applies to "hotel, within walking distance to dining (restaurants) and shopping."

   ```output

   Key takeaways:

   - In a hybrid search, you can integrate vector search with full-text search over keywords. Filters, spell check, and semantic ranking apply to textual content only, and not vectors. In this final query, there's no semantic `answer` because the system didn't produce one that was sufficiently strong.

   - Actual results include more detail, including semantic captions and highlights. Results were modified for readability. To get the full structure of the response, run the request in the REST client.

## Clean up

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can find and manage resources in the Azure portal by using the **All resources** or **Resource groups** link in the leftmost pane.

If you want to keep the search service, but delete the index and documents, you can use the `SearchIndexClient` object's `delete_index()` method. Find the cell below section titled "Clean up" and execute the cell if you want to delete the `hotels-vector-quickstart` index:

```python
index_client.delete_index(index_name)
print(f"Index '{index_name}' deleted successfully.")
```
