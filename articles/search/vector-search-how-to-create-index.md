# Create a vector index

In Azure AI Search, a *vector store* has an index schema that defines vector and nonvector fields, a vector configuration for algorithms that create and compress the embedding space, and settings on vector field definitions that are used in query requests. 

The [Create or Update Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) API creates the vector store. Follow these steps to index vector data:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> + Define a schema with vector algorithms and optional compression
> + Add vector field definitions
> + Load prevectorized data [as a separate step](#load-vector-data-for-indexing), or use [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) for data chunking and encoding during indexing

This article explains the workflow and uses REST for illustration. Once you understand the basic workflow, continue with the Azure SDK code samples in the [azure-search-vector-samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples) repository for guidance on using these features in test and production code.

> [!TIP]
> Use the Azure portal to [create a vector index](search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md) and try integrated data chunking and vectorization.

## Prerequisites

+ Azure AI Search, in any region and on any tier. Most existing services support vector search. For services created before January 2019, there's a small subset that can't create a vector index. In this situation, a new service must be created. If you're using integrated vectorization (skillsets that call Azure AI), Azure AI Search must be in the same region as Azure OpenAI or Azure AI services.

+ [Pre-existing vector embeddings](vector-search-how-to-generate-embeddings.md) or use [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md), where embedding models are called from the indexing pipeline.

+ You should know the dimensions limit of the model used to create the embeddings. Valid values are 2 through 3072 dimensions. In Azure OpenAI, for **text-embedding-ada-002**, the length of the numerical vector is 1536. For **text-embedding-3-small** or **text-embedding-3-large**, the vector length is 3072. 

+ You should also know what the supported similarity metrics are. For Azure OpenAI, similarity is [computed using `cosine`](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings#cosine-similarity). 

+ You should be familiar with [creating an index](search-how-to-create-search-index.md). The schema must include a field for the document key, other fields you want to search or filter, and other configurations for behaviors needed during indexing and queries. 

## Prepare documents for indexing

Prior to indexing, assemble a document payload that includes fields of vector and nonvector data. The document structure must conform to the index schema. 

Make sure your documents:

1. Provide a field or a metadata property that uniquely identifies each document. All search indexes require a document key. To satisfy document key requirements, a source document must have one field or property that can uniquely identify it in the index. This source field must be mapped to an index field of type `Edm.String` and `key=true` in the search index. 

1. Provide vector data (an array of single-precision floating point numbers) in source fields.

   Vector fields contain an array generated by embedding models, one embedding per field, where the field is a top-level field (not part of a nested or complex type). For the simplest integration, we recommend the embedding models in [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access), such as **text-embedding-ada-002** for text documents or the [Image Retrieval REST API](/rest/api/computervision/2023-02-01-preview/image-retrieval/vectorize-image) for images.

   If you can take a dependency on indexers and skillsets, consider using [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) that encodes images and alphanumeric content during indexing. Your field definitions are for vector fields, but source data can be text or images, with vector arrays created during indexing.

1. Provide other fields with human-readable alphanumeric content for the query response, and for hybrid query scenarios that include full text search or semantic ranking in the same request. 

Your search index should include fields and content for all of the query scenarios you want to support. Suppose you want to search or filter over product names, versions, metadata, or addresses. In this case, similarity search isn't especially helpful. Keyword search, geo-search, or filters would be a better choice. A search index that includes a comprehensive field collection of vector and nonvector data provides maximum flexibility for query construction and response composition.

A short example of a documents payload that includes vector and nonvector fields is in the [load vector data](#load-vector-data-for-indexing) section of this article.

## Add a vector search configuration

A vector configuration specifies the parameters used during indexing to create "nearest neighbor" information among the vector nodes:

+ Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)
+ Exhaustive KNN

If you choose HNSW on a field, you can opt in for exhaustive KNN at query time. But the other direction doesn’t work: if you choose exhaustive, you can’t later request HNSW search because the extra data structures that enable approximate search don’t exist.

A vector configuration also specifies quantization methods for reducing vector size:

+ Scalar
+ Binary (available in 2024-07-01 only and in newer Azure SDK packages)

For instructions on how to migrate to the latest version, see [Upgrade REST API](search-api-migration.md).

### [**2024-07-01**](#tab/config-2024-07-01)

[**2024-07-01**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2024-07-01) is generally available. It supports a vector configuration having:

+ `vectorSearch.algorithms` support HNSW and exhaustive KNN.
+ `vectorSearch.compressions` support scalar and binary quantization, oversampling, and reranking with original vectors.
+ `vectorSearch.profiles` provide for multiple combinations of algorithm and compression configurations.

Be sure to have a strategy for [vectorizing your content](vector-search-how-to-generate-embeddings.md). We recommend [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) and [query-time vectorizers](vector-search-how-to-configure-vectorizer.md) for built-in encoding.

1. Use the [Create or Update Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) API to create the index.

1. Add a `vectorSearch` section in the index that specifies the search algorithms used to create the embedding space. 

   ```json
    "vectorSearch": {
        "compressions": [
            {
                "name": "scalar-quantization",
                "kind": "scalarQuantization",
                "rerankWithOriginalVectors": true,
                "defaultOversampling": 10.0,
                    "scalarQuantizationParameters": {
                        "quantizedDataType": "int8"
                    }
            },
            {
                "name": "binary-quantization",
                "kind": "binaryQuantization",
                "rerankWithOriginalVectors": true,
                "defaultOversampling": 10.0,
            }
        ],
        "algorithms": [
            {
                "name": "hnsw-1",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 4,
                    "efConstruction": 400,
                    "efSearch": 500,
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "hnsw-2",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 8,
                    "efConstruction": 800,
                    "efSearch": 800,
                    "metric": "hamming"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "eknn",
                "kind": "exhaustiveKnn",
                "exhaustiveKnnParameters": {
                    "metric": "euclidean"
                }
            }

        ],
        "profiles": [
          {
            "name": "vector-profile-hnsw-scalar",
            "compression": "scalar-quantization",
            "algorithm": "hnsw-1"
          }
        ]
    }
   ```

   **Key points**:

   + Names for each configuration of compression, algorithm, and profile must be unique for its type within the index.

   + `vectorSearch.compressions.kind` can be `scalarQuantization` or `binaryQuantization`.

   + `vectorSearch.compressions.rerankWithOriginalVectors` uses the original, uncompressed vectors to recalculate similarity and rerank the top results returned by the initial search query. The uncompressed vectors exist in the search index even if `stored` is false. This property is optional. Default is true.

   + `vectorSearch.compressions.defaultOversampling` considers a broader set of potential results to offset the reduction in information from quantization. The formula for potential results consists of the `k` in the query, with an oversampling multiplier. For example, if the query specifies a `k` of 5, and oversampling is 20, then the query effectively requests 100 documents for use in reranking, using the original uncompressed vector for that purpose. Only the top `k` reranked results are returned. This property is optional. Default is 4.

   + `vectorSearch.compressions.scalarQuantizationParameters.quantizedDataType` must be set to `int8`. This is the only primitive data type supported at this time. This property is optional. Default is `int8`.

   + `vectorSearch.algorithms.kind` are either `"hnsw"` or `"exhaustiveKnn"`. These are the Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithms used to organize vector content during indexing.

   + `vectorSearch.algorithms.m` is the bi-directional link count. Default is 4. The range is 4 to 10. Lower values should return less noise in the results.
 
   + `vectorSearch.algorithms.efConstruction` is the number of nearest neighbors used during indexing. Default is 400. The range is 100 to 1,000.

   + `"vectorSearch.algorithms.fSearch` is the number of nearest neighbors used during search. Default is 500. The range is 100 to 1,000.

   + `vectorSearch.algorithms.metric` should be "cosine" if you're using Azure OpenAI, otherwise use the similarity metric associated with the embedding model you're using. Supported values are `cosine`, `dotProduct`, `euclidean`, `hamming` (used for [indexing binary data](vector-search-how-to-index-binary-data.md)).

   + `vectorSearch.profiles` add a layer of abstraction for accommodating richer definitions. A profile is defined in `vectorSearch`, and then referenced by name on each vector field. It's a combination of compression and algorithm configurations. This is the property that you assign to a vector field, and it determines the fields' algorithm and compression.

## Add a vector field to the fields collection

The fields collection must include a field for the document key, vector fields, and any other fields that you need for hybrid search scenarios.

Vector fields are characterized by [their data type](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types#edm-data-types-for-vector-fields), a `dimensions` property based on the embedding model used to output the vectors, and a vector profile.

### [**2024-07-01**](#tab/rest-2024-07-01)

[**2024-07-01**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2024-07-01) is generally available. 

1. Use the [Create or Update Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) to create the index.

1. Define a vector field with the following attributes. You can store one generated embedding per field. For each vector field:

   + `type` must be a [vector data types](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types#edm-data-types-for-vector-fields). `Collection(Edm.Single)` is the most common for embedding models.
   + `dimensions` is the number of dimensions generated by the embedding model. For text-embedding-ada-002, it's 1536.
   + `vectorSearchProfile` is the name of a profile defined elsewhere in the index.
   + `searchable` must be true.
   + `retrievable` can be true or false. True returns the raw vectors (1536 of them) as plain text and consumes storage space. Set to true if you're passing a vector result to a downstream app.
   + `stored` can be true or false. It determines whether an extra copy of vectors is stored for retrieval. For more information, see [Reduce vector size](vector-search-how-to-storage-options.md).
   + `filterable`, `facetable`, `sortable` must be false. 

1. Add filterable nonvector fields to the collection, such as "title" with `filterable` set to true, if you want to invoke [prefiltering or postfiltering](vector-search-filters.md) on the [vector query](vector-search-how-to-query.md).

1. Add other fields that define the substance and structure of the textual content you're indexing. At a minimum, you need a document key. 

   You should also add fields that are useful in the query or in its response. The following example shows vector fields for title and content ("titleVector", "contentVector") that are equivalent to vectors. It also provides fields for equivalent textual content ("title", "content") useful for sorting, filtering, and reading in a search result.

   The following example shows the fields collection:

### [**2024-05-01-preview**](#tab/rest-2024-05-01-Preview)

+ Supports all [vector data types](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types#edm-data-types-for-vector-fields).
+ Inclusive of `2024-03-01-preview`, with new support [indexing binary data for vector search](vector-search-how-to-index-binary-data.md).

1. Use the [Create or Update Index Preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true) to define the fields collection of an index.

1. Add vector fields to the fields collection. You can store one generated embedding per document field. For each vector field:

   + `type` can be `Collection(Edm.Single)`, `Collection(Edm.Half)`, `Collection(Edm.Int16)`, `Collection(Edm.SByte)`
   + `dimensions` is the number of dimensions generated by the embedding model. For text-embedding-ada-002, it's 1536.
   + `vectorSearchProfile` is the name of a profile defined elsewhere in the index.
   + `searchable` must be true.
   + `retrievable` can be true or false. True returns the raw vectors (1536 of them) as plain text and consumes storage space. Set to true if you're passing a vector result to a downstream app. False is required if `stored` is false.
   + `stored` is a new boolean property that applies to vector fields only. True stores a copy of vectors returned in search results. False discards that copy during indexing. You can search on vectors, but can't return vectors in results.
   + `filterable`, `facetable`, `sortable` must be false. 

1. Add filterable nonvector fields to the collection, such as "title" with `filterable` set to true, if you want to invoke [prefiltering or postfiltering](vector-search-filters.md) on the [vector query](vector-search-how-to-query.md).

1. Add other fields that define the substance and structure of the textual content you're indexing. At a minimum, you need a document key. 

   You should also add fields that are useful in the query or in its response. The following example shows vector fields for title and content ("titleVector", "contentVector") that are equivalent to vectors. It also provides fields for equivalent textual content ("title", "content") useful for sorting, filtering, and reading in a search result.

1. The following example shows the fields collection:

## Load vector data for indexing

Content that you provide for indexing must conform to the index schema and include a unique string value for the document key. Prevectorized data is loaded into one or more vector fields, which can coexist with other fields containing alphanumeric content.

You can use either [push or pull methodologies](search-what-is-data-import.md) for data ingestion. 

### [**Push APIs**](#tab/push)

Use **Documents - Index** to load vector and nonvector data into an index. The push APIs for indexing are identical across all stable and preview versions. Use any of the following APIs to load documents:

+ [2024-07-01](/rest/api/searchservice/documents)
+ [2024-05-01-preview](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true)

```http

### [**Pull APIs (indexers)**](#tab/pull)

Pull APIs refer to indexers, which automate multiple indexing steps, from data retrieval and refresh, to [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) that encodes content for vector search.

+ Data sources must be a [supported type](search-indexer-overview.md#supported-data-sources).

+ Skillsets provide the Text Split skill for data chunking, plus skills that connect to embedding models. A few are generally available, others are still in preview. Skills and vectorizers are used to generate embeddings. The skill you choose for indexing should be paired with an [equivalent vectorizer](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md#using-integrated-vectorization-in-queries) for queries. For vectorization during indexing, choose from the following skills:

  + [AzureOpenAIEmbedding skill](cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding.md)
  + [Custom Web API skill](cognitive-search-custom-skill-web-api.md)
  + [Azure AI Vision multimodal embeddings skill (preview)](cognitive-search-skill-vision-vectorize.md)
  + [AML skill (preview)](cognitive-search-aml-skill.md) to generate embeddings for models hosted in the Azure AI Foundry model catalog. See [How to implement integrated vectorization using models from Azure AI Foundry](vector-search-integrated-vectorization-ai-studio.md) for details.

+ Indexes provide the vector field definitions and vector search configurations. Those definitions are described in this article.

+ Indexers drive the indexing pipeline. For more information, see [Create an indexer](search-howto-create-indexers.md).

If you're familiar with indexers and skillsets:

+ Field mappings, output field mappings, and deletion detection settings apply to vector and nonvector fields equally.

+ If vector data is sourced in files, we recommend a nondefault `parsingMode` such as `json`, `jsonLines`, or `csv` based on the shape of the data. 

+ For data sources, [Azure blob indexers](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) and [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL indexers](search-howto-index-cosmosdb.md) with one of the aforementioned parsingModes have been tested and confirmed to work. 

+ The dimensions of all vectors from the data source must be the same and match their index definition for the field they're mapping to. The indexer throws an error on any documents that don’t match.

---

## Check your index for vector content

For validation purposes, you can query the index using Search Explorer in the Azure portal or a REST API call. Because Azure AI Search can't convert a vector to human-readable text, try to return fields from the same document that provide evidence of the match. For example, if the vector query targets the "titleVector" field, you could select "title" for the search results.

Fields must be attributed as "retrievable" to be included in the results.

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/portal-check-index)

+ Review the indexes in **Search management** > **Indexes** to view index size all-up and vector index size. A positive vector index size indicates vectors are present.

+ Use [Search Explorer](search-explorer.md) to query an index. Search Explorer has two views: Query view (default) and JSON view. 

  + Set **Query options** > **Hide vector values in search results** for more readable results.

  + [Use the JSON view for vector queries](vector-search-how-to-query.md). You can either paste in a JSON definition of the vector query you want to execute, or use the built-in text-to-vector or image-to-vector conversion if your index has a [vectorizer assignment](vector-search-how-to-configure-vectorizer.md). For more information about image search, see [Quickstart: Search for images in Search Explorer](search-get-started-portal-image-search.md).

  + Use the default Query view for a quick confirmation that the index contains vectors. The query view is for full text search. Although you can't use it for vector queries, you can send an empty search (`search=*`) to check for content. The content of all fields, including vector fields, is returned as plain text.

  + See [Create a vector query](vector-search-how-to-query.md) for more details.

### [**REST API**](#tab/rest-check-index)

The following REST API example is a vector query, but it returns only nonvector fields (title, content, category). Only fields marked as "retrievable" can be returned in search results.

```http
POST https://my-search-service.search.windows.net/indexes/my-index/docs/search?api-version=2024-07-01
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: {{admin-api-key}}
{
    "vector": {
        "value": [
            -0.009154141,
            0.018708462,
            . . . 
            -0.02178128,
            -0.00086512347
        ],
        "fields": "contentVector",
        "k": 5
    },
    "select": "title, content, category"
}
```

## Update a vector store

To update a vector store, modify the schema and if necessary, reload documents to populate new fields. APIs for schema updates include [Create or Update Index (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update), [CreateOrUpdateIndex](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.searchindexclient.createorupdateindexasync) in the Azure SDK for .NET, [create_or_update_index](/python/api/azure-search-documents/azure.search.documents.indexes.searchindexclient?view=azure-python#azure-search-documents-indexes-searchindexclient-create-or-update-index&preserve-view=true) in the Azure SDK for Python, and similar methods in other Azure SDKs.

The standard guidance for updating an index is covered in [Update or rebuild an index](search-howto-reindex.md). 

Key points include:

+ Drop and rebuild is often required for updates to and deletion of existing fields.

+ However, you can update an existing schema with the following modifications, with no rebuild required:

  + Add new fields to a fields collection.
  + Add new vector configurations, assigned to new fields but not existing fields that have already been vectorized.
  + Change "retrievable" (values are true or false) on an existing field. Vector fields must be searchable and retrievable, but if you want to disable access to a vector field in situations where drop and rebuild isn't feasible, you can set retrievable to false.

## Next steps

As a next step, we recommend [Query vector data in a search index](vector-search-how-to-query.md).

Code samples in the [azure-search-vector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples) repository demonstrate end-to-end workflows that include schema definition, vectorization, indexing, and queries.

There's demo code for [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-python), [C#](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-dotnet), and [JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-javascript).
