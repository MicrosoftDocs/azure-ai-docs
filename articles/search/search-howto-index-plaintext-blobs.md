# Index plain text blobs and files in Azure AI Search

**Applies to**: [Blob indexers](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md), [File indexers](search-file-storage-integration.md)

When using an indexer to extract searchable blob text or file content for full text search, you can assign a parsing mode to get better indexing outcomes. By default, the indexer parses a blob's `content` property as a single chunk of text. However, if all blobs and files contain plain text in the same encoding, you can significantly improve indexing performance by using the `text` parsing mode.

Recommendations for `text` parsing include either of the following characteristics:

+ File type is `.txt`
+ Files are of any type, but the content itself is text (for example, program source code, HTML, XML, and so forth). For files in a markup language, the syntax characters come through as static text.

Recall that all indexers serialize to JSON. By default, the content of the entire text file is indexed within one large field as `"content": "<file-contents>"`. New line and return instructions are embedded in the content field and expressed as `\r\n\`.

If you want a more refined or granular outcome, and if the file type is compatible, consider the following solutions:

+ [`delimitedText`](search-howto-index-csv-blobs.md) parsing mode, if the source is CSV
+ [`jsonArray` or `jsonLines`](search-howto-index-json-blobs.md), if the source is JSON

An alternative third option for breaking content into multiple parts requires advanced features in the form of [AI enrichment](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md). It adds analysis that identifies and assigns chunks of the file to different search fields. You might find a full or partial solution through [built-in skills](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md) such as entity recognition or keyword extraction, but a more likely solution might be a custom learning model that understands your content, wrapped in a [custom skill](cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface.md).

## Set up plain text indexing

To index plain text blobs, create or update an indexer definition with the `parsingMode` configuration property set to `text` on a [Create Indexer](/rest/api/searchservice/indexers/create) request:

```http
PUT https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=2024-07-01
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: [admin key]

{
  ... other parts of indexer definition
  "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "text" } }
}
```

By default, the `UTF-8` encoding is assumed. To specify a different encoding, use the `encoding` configuration property. The supported [list of encodings](/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-text-encoding#list-of-encodings) is under **.NET 5 and later support** column.

```http
{
  ... other parts of indexer definition
  "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "text", "encoding" : "iso-8859-1" } }
}
```

## Request example

Parsing modes are specified in the indexer definition.

```http
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers?api-version=2024-07-01
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: [admin key]

{
  "name" : "my-plaintext-indexer",
  "dataSourceName" : "my-blob-datasource",
  "targetIndexName" : "my-target-index",
  "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "delimitedText", "delimitedTextHeaders" : "id,datePublished,tags" } }
}
```
