# Data sources gallery

Find a data connector from Microsoft or a partner that works with [an indexer](search-indexer-overview.md) to simplify data ingestion into a search index. This article has the following sections:

+ [Generally available data sources by Azure AI Search](#ga)
+ [Preview data sources by Azure AI Search](#preview)
+ [Data sources from our Partners](#partners)


> [!NOTE]
> The connectors mentioned in this article don't represent the only methods for indexing data from data sources to AI Search, but low/no-code options to accomplish this task. You have the option to develop your own connector utilizing the [Push REST API/SDK](search-what-is-data-import.md#pushing-data-to-an-index). This implies that provided you can programmatically extract data from a source, you can also employ the corresponding programmatic Push method to index your data.
