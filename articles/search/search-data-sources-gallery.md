# Data sources gallery

Find a data connector from Microsoft or a partner that works with [an indexer](search-indexer-overview.md) to simplify data ingestion into a search index.

> [!NOTE]
> The connectors mentioned in this article represent one method for indexing data in Azure AI Search. You also have the option of developing your own connector using the [Push REST API or An Azure SDK](search-what-is-data-import.md#pushing-data-to-an-index).
