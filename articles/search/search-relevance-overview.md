# Relevance in Azure AI Search

In a query operation, the relevance of any given result is determined by a ranking algorithm that evaluates the strength of a match based on how closely the query corresponds to an indexed document. When a match is found, an algorithm assigns a score, and results are ranked by that score and the topmost results are returned in the response. 

Ranking occurs whenever the query request includes full text or vector queries. It doesn't occur if the query invokes strict pattern matching, such as a filter-only query or a specialized query form like autocomplete, suggestions, geospatial search, fuzzy search, or regular expression search. A uniform search score of 1.0 indicates the absence of a ranking algorithm.

## Levels of ranking

The query engine in Azure AI Search supports a multi-level approach to ranking search results, where there's a built-in ranking modality for each query type, plus extra ranking capabilities for extended relevance tuning.

This section describes the levels of scoring operations. For an illustration of how they work together, see the [diagram](#diagram-of-ranking-algorithms) in this article. A [comparison of all search score types and ranges](#types-of-search-scores) is also provided in this article.

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Level&nbsp;1&nbsp;(L1) | Initial search score (`@search.score`). <br>For text queries matching on tokenized strings, results are always initially ranked using the [BM25 ranking algorithm](index-similarity-and-scoring.md). <br>For vector queries, results are ranked using either [Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) or exhaustive K-nearest neighbor (KNN)](vector-search-ranking.md). Image search or multimodal searches are based on vector queries and scored using the L1 vector ranking algorithms. |
| Fused&nbsp;L1 | Scoring from multiple queries using the [Reciprocal Ranking Fusion (RRF) algorithm](hybrid-search-ranking.md). RRF is used for hybrid queries that include text and vector components. RRF is also used when multiple vector queries execute in parallel. A search score from RRF is reflected in `@search.score` [over a different range](#types-of-search-scores).|
| Level&nbsp;2&nbsp;(L2) | [Semantic ranking score (`@search.reRankerScore`)](semantic-search-overview.md) applies machine reading comprehension to the textual content retrieved by L1 ranking, rescoring the L1 results to better match the semantic intent of the query. L2 reranks L1 results because doing so saves time and money; it would be prohibitive to use semantic ranking as an L1 ranking system. Semantic ranking is a premium feature that bills for usage of the semantic ranking models. It's optional for text queries and vector queries that contain text, but required for [agentic retrieval (preview)](agentic-retrieval-overview.md). Although agentic retrieval sends multiple queries to the query engine, the ranking algorithm for agentic retrieval is the semantic ranker. |

## Relevance tuning

***Relevance tuning*** is a technique for boosting search scores based on extra criteria such as weighted fields, freshness, or proximity. In Azure AI Search, relevance tuning options vary based on query type:

+ For textual and numeric (nonvector) content in keyword or hybrid search, you can tune relevance through [scoring profiles](#custom-boosting-logic-using-scoring-profiles) or invoking the [semantic ranker](semantic-search-overview.md).

+ For vector content in a hybrid query, you can [weight a vector field](hybrid-search-ranking.md#weighted-scores) to boost the importance of the vector component relative to the text component of the hybrid query.

+ For pure vector queries, you can experiment between Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) and exhaustive K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to see if one algorithm outperforms the other for your scenario. HNSW graphing with an exhaustive KNN override at query time is the most flexible approach for comparison testing. You can also experiment with various embedding models to see which ones produce higher quality results. Finally, remember that a hybrid query or a vector query on documents that include nonvector fields are in-scope for relevance tuning, so it's just the vector fields themselves that can't participate in a relevance tuning effort.

## Custom boosting logic using scoring profiles

[Scoring profiles](index-add-scoring-profiles.md) are an optional feature for boosting scores based on extra user-defined criteria. Criteria can include weighted fields where a match found in a specific field is given more weight than the same match found in a different field. Criteria can also be defined through functions that boost by freshness, proximity, magnitude, or range. There's no extra costs associated with scoring profiles. To use a scoring profile, you define it in an index and then specify it on a query. 

Scoring logic applies to text and numeric nonvector content. You can use scoring profiles with:

+ [Text (keyword) search](search-query-create.md)
+ [Pure vector queries](vector-search-how-to-query.md)
+ [Hybrid queries](hybrid-search-how-to-query.md), where text and vector subqueries execute in parallel
+ [Semantically ranked queries](semantic-how-to-query-request.md)

For standalone text queries, scoring profiles identify the top 1,000 matches in a [BM25-ranked search](index-similarity-and-scoring.md), with the top 50 matches returned in the response.

For pure vectors, the query is vector-only, but if the [*k*-matching documents](vector-search-ranking.md) include nonvector fields with human-readable content, a scoring profile is applied to nonvector fields in `k` documents. 

For the text component of a hybrid query, scoring profiles identify the top 1,000 matches in a BM25-ranked search. However, once those 1,000 results are identified, they're restored to their original BM25 order so that they can be rescored alongside vectors results in the final [Reciprocal Ranking Function (RRF)](hybrid-search-ranking.md) ordering, where the scoring profile (identified as "final document boosting adjustment" in the illustration) is applied to the merged results, along with [vector weighting](vector-search-how-to-query.md#vector-weighting), and [semantic ranking](semantic-search-overview.md) as the last step.

For semantically ranked queries (not shown in the diagram), assuming you use the latest preview REST API or a preview Azure SDK package, scoring profiles can be applied over an L2 ranked result set, generating a new `@search.rerankerBoostedScore` that determines the final ranking.

## Types of search scores

Scored results are indicated for each match in the query response. This table lists all of the search scores with an associated range. Range varies by algorithm.

| Score | Range | Algorithm|
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `@search.score` | 0 through unlimited | [BM25 ranking algorithm](index-similarity-and-scoring.md#scores-in-a-text-results) for text search |
| `@search.score` | 0.333 - 1.00 | [HNSW or exhaustive KNN algorithm](vector-search-ranking.md#scores-in-a-vector-search-results) for vector search |
| `@search.score` | 0 through an upper limit determined by the number of queries | [RRF algorithm](hybrid-search-ranking.md#scores-in-a-hybrid-search-results) |
| `@search.rerankerScore` | 0.00 - 4.00 | [Semantic ranking algorithm](semantic-search-overview.md#how-results-are-scored) for L2 ranking |
| `@search.rerankerBoostedScore` | 0 through unlimited  | [Semantic ranking with scoring profile boosting](semantic-how-to-enable-scoring-profiles.md) (scores can be significantly higher than 4) |

## Diagram of ranking algorithms

The following diagram illustrates how the ranking algorithms work together.

:::image type="content" source="media/scoring-profiles/scoring-over-ranked-results.png" alt-text="Diagram showing which fields have a scoring profile and when ranking occurs.":::

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow diagram currently omits `@search.rerankerBoostedScore` and a step for semantic ranking with boosting from a scoring profile. If you use semantic ranking with scoring profile, the scoring profile is applied after L2 ranking, and the final score is based on `@search.rerankerBoostedScore`.

## Example query inclusive of all ranking algorithms

A query that generates the previous workflow might look like the following example. This hybrid semantic query is scored using RRF (based on L1 scores for text and vectors), and semantic ranking.

```http
POST https://{{search-service-name}}.search.windows.net/indexes/{{index-name}}/docs/search?api-version=2025-08-01-preview

{
  "search": "cloud formation over water",
  "count": true,
  "vectorQueries": [
    {
      "kind": "text",
      "text": "cloud formation over water",

    }
  ],
  "queryType": "semantic",
  "semanticConfiguration": "my-semantic-configuration",
  "select": "title,chunk",
  "top": 5
}
```

A response for the above query includes the original RRF `@search.core` and the `@search.rerankerScore`.

It could be that the relatively unobstructed path of the clouds \n\nover the ocean surface was interrupted by thermal instability created by the iceberg.

Clouds infused with ship exhaust have more and smaller droplets than unpolluted clouds. As a result, light \n\nhitting the ship tracks scatters in many directions, often making them appear brighter than other types of marine clouds, which are \n\nusually seeded by larger, naturally occurring particles like sea salt.",

The winds blowing out from the land push a wave of air ahead like a  \n\nbow wave moving ahead of a boat. \n\nParts of these waves are favorable for cloud formation, while other parts are not. The dust blowing out from Africa appears to be \n\nriding these waves. Dust has been known to affect cloud growth, but it probably has little to do with the cloud pattern observed here.",
