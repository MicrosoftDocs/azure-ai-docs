# Azure AI Search regions list

This article identifies the cloud regions in which Azure AI Search is available. It also lists which premium features are available in each region.

## Features subject to regional availability

When you create an Azure AI Search service, your region selection might depend on features that are only available in certain regions. The following table lists those region-specific features.

| Feature | Description | Availability |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [AI enrichment](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md) | Refers to [built-in skills](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md) that make internal calls to Foundry Tools for enrichment and transformation during indexing. Integration requires that Azure AI Search coexists with a [Microsoft Foundry resource](/azure/ai-services/multi-service-resource) in the same physical region. You can bypass region requirements by using [identity-based connections](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md#bill-through-a-keyless-connection), currently in public preview. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Availability zones](/azure/reliability/reliability-ai-search#availability-zone-support) | Divides a region's data centers into distinct physical location groups, providing high availability within the same geo. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Agentic retrieval](agentic-retrieval-overview.md) | Uses the agentic retrieval engine designed for conversational search. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Confidential computing](search-security-overview.md#data-in-use) | Deploys your search service on confidential VMs to process data in a hardware-based trusted execution environment.<p>Confidential computing disables or restricts certain features, including agentic retrieval, semantic ranker, query rewrite, and skillset execution. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Semantic ranker](semantic-search-overview.md) | Takes a dependency on Microsoft-hosted models in specific regions. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Query rewrite](semantic-how-to-query-rewrite.md) | Takes a dependency on Microsoft-hosted models in specific regions. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Extra capacity](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits) | Higher-capacity partitions became available in select regions starting in April 2024, with a second wave following in May 2024. Currently, there are just a few regions that *don't* offer higher-capacity partitions.<p>If you have an older search service in a supported region, check if you can [upgrade your service](search-how-to-upgrade.md). Otherwise, create a new search service to benefit from more capacity at the same billing rate. | Regional support is noted in the footnotes of this article. |
| Capacity constraints | In some regions, insufficient capacity prevents you from creating search services on certain tiers. The Azure portal automatically hides regions and tiers that aren't available for new deployments. | Regional support is noted in the footnotes of this article. |
| [Azure Vision in Foundry Tools 4.0 multimodal APIs](search-get-started-portal-image-search.md) | Refers to the Azure Vision multimodal embeddings skill and vectorizer that call the multimodal embedding API. | Check the [Azure Vision region list](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis#region-availability) first, and then verify Azure AI Search is available in the same region.|

## Azure Public regions

You can create an Azure AI Search service in any of the following Azure public regions. Almost all of these regions support [higher-capacity tiers](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits). Exceptions are noted where applicable.
