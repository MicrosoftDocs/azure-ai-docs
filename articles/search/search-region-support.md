# Azure AI Search regions list

This article identifies the cloud regions in which Azure AI Search is available. It also lists which premium features are available in each region.

## Features subject to regional availability

When you create an Azure AI Search service, your region selection might depend on features that are only available in certain regions. The following table lists those region-specific features.

| Feature | Description | Availability |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [AI enrichment](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md) | Refers to [built-in skills](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md) that make internal calls to Azure AI for enrichment and transformation during indexing. Integration requires that Azure AI Search coexists with an [Azure AI services multi-service account](/azure/ai-services/multi-service-resource#azure-ai-services-resource-for-azure-ai-search-skills) in the same physical region. You can bypass region requirements by using [identity-based connections](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md#bill-through-a-keyless-connection), currently in public preview. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Availability zones](search-reliability.md#availability-zone-support) | Divides a region's data centers into distinct physical location groups, providing high availability within the same geo. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Agentic retrieval](search-agentic-retrieval-concept.md) | Takes a dependency on semantic ranker, which is another premium feature. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Semantic ranker](semantic-search-overview.md) | Takes a dependency on Microsoft-hosted models in specific regions. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Query rewrite](semantic-how-to-query-rewrite.md) | Takes a dependency on Microsoft-hosted models in specific regions. | Regional support is noted in this article. |
| [Extra capacity](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits) | Higher-capacity partitions became available in select regions starting in April 2024, with a second wave following in May 2024. Currently, there are just a few regions that *don't* offer higher-capacity partitions.<p>If you have an older search service in a supported region, check if you can [upgrade your service](search-how-to-upgrade.md). Otherwise, create a new search service to benefit from more capacity at the same billing rate. | Regional support is noted in the footnotes of this article. |
| Capacity constraints | In some regions, insufficient capacity prevents you from creating search services on certain tiers. The Azure portal automatically hides regions and tiers that aren't available for new deployments. | Regional support is noted in the footnotes of this article. |
| [Azure AI Vision 4.0 multimodal APIs](search-get-started-portal-image-search.md) | Refers to the Azure AI Vision multimodal embeddings skill and vectorizer that call the multimodal embedding API. | Check the [Azure AI Vision region list](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis#region-availability) first, and then verify Azure AI Search is available in the same region.|

## Azure Public regions

You can create an Azure AI Search service in any of the following Azure public regions. Almost all of these regions support [higher-capacity tiers](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits). Exceptions are noted where they apply.
