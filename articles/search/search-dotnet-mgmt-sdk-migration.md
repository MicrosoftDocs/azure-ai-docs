# Upgrade versions of the Azure Search .NET Management SDK

This article points you to libraries in the Azure SDK for .NET for managing a search service. These libraries provide the APIs used to create, configure, and delete search services. They also provide APIS used to adjust capacity, manage API keys, and configure network security.

Management SDKs target a specific version of the Management REST API. Release notes for each library indicate which REST API version is the target for each package. For more information about concepts and operations, see [Search Management (REST)](/rest/api/searchmanagement/).

## Versions

The following table lists the client libraries used to provision a search service.

| Namespace | Version| Status | Change log |

## Checklist for upgrade

1. Review the [change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/search/Azure.ResourceManager.Search/CHANGELOG.md) for updates to the library.

1. In your application code, delete the reference to `Microsoft.Azure.Management.Search` and its dependencies.

1. Add a reference for `Azure.ResourceManager.Search` using either the NuGet Package Manager Console or by right-clicking on your project references and selecting "Manage NuGet Packages..." in Visual Studio.

1. Once NuGet has downloaded the new packages and their dependencies, replace the API calls.
