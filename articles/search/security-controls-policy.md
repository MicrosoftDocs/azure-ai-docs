# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure AI Search

If you are using [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) to enforce the recommendations in
[Microsoft cloud security benchmark](/azure/security/benchmarks/introduction), then you probably already know
that you can create policies for identifying and fixing non-compliant services. These policies might
be custom, or they might be based on built-in definitions that provide compliance criteria and
appropriate solutions for well-understood best practices.

For Azure AI Search, there is currently one built-definition, listed below, that you can use
in a policy assignment. The built-in is for logging and monitoring. By using this built-in
definition in a [policy that you create](/azure/governance/policy/assign-policy-portal), the system
will scan for search services that do not have [resource logging](monitor-azure-cognitive-search.md), and
then enable it accordingly.

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance)
provides Microsoft-created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the
**compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This
page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure AI Search. You can
assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources
compliant with the specific standard.
