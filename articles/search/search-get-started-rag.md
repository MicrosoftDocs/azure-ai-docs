# Quickstart: Generative search (RAG) with grounding data from Azure AI Search

This quickstart shows you how to send basic and complex queries to a Large Language Model (LLM) for a conversational search experience over your indexed content on Azure AI Search. You use the Azure portal to set up the resources, and then run Python code to call the APIs. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- [Azure AI Search](search-create-service-portal.md), Basic tier or higher so that you can [enable semantic ranker](semantic-how-to-enable-disable.md). Region must be the same one used for Azure OpenAI.

- [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource with a deployment of `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, or equivalent LLM, in the same region as Azure AI Search.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and the [Jupyter package](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/). For more information, see [Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).

## Download file

[Download a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/main/Quickstart-RAG) from GitHub to send the requests in this quickstart. For more information, see [Downloading files from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github).

You can also start a new file on your local system and create requests manually by using the instructions in this article. 

## Configure access

Requests to the search endpoint must be authenticated and authorized. You can use API keys or roles for this task. Keys are easier to start with, but roles are more secure. This quickstart assumes roles.

You're setting up two clients, so you need permissions on both resources.

Azure AI Search is receiving the query request from your local system. Assign yourself the **Search Index Data Reader** role assignment for that task. If you're also creating and loading the hotel sample index, add **Search Service Contributor** and **Search Index Data Contributor** roles as well.

Azure OpenAI is receiving the (query) "Can you recommend a few hotels" from your local system, plus its receiving the search results (source) from the search service. Assign yourself and the search service the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Configure Azure AI Search to use a system-assigned managed identity so that you can you give it role assignments:

    1. In the Azure portal, [find your search service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices).
 
    1. On the left menu, select **Settings** > **Identity**.

    1. On the System assigned tab, set status to **On**.

1. Configure Azure AI Search for role-based access:

    1. In the Azure portal, find your Azure AI Search service.

    1. On the left menu, select **Settings** > **Keys**, and then select either **Role-based access control** or **Both**.

1. Assign roles:

    1. On the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)**.

    1. On Azure AI Search, make sure you have permissions to create, load, and query a search index:

       - **Search Index Data Reader**
       - **Search Index Data Contributor**
       - **Search Service Contributor**

    1. On Azure OpenAI, select **Access control (IAM)** to assign yourself and the search service identity permissions on Azure OpenAI. The code for this quickstart runs locally. Requests to Azure OpenAI originate from your system. Also, search results from the search engine are passed to Azure OpenAI. For these reasons, both you and the search service need permissions on Azure OpenAI.

       - **Cognitive Services OpenAI User**

It can take several minutes for permissions to take effect.

## Create an index

We recommend the hotels-sample-index, which can be created in minutes and runs on any search service tier. This index is created using built-in sample data.

1. In the Azure portal, [find your search service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices).

1. On the **Overview** home page, select [**Import data**](search-get-started-portal.md) to start the wizard.

1. On the **Connect to your data** page, select **Samples** from the dropdown list.

1. Choose the **hotels-sample**.

1. Select **Next** through the remaining pages, accepting the default values.

1. Once the index is created, select **Search management** > **Indexes** from the left menu to open the index.

1. Select **Edit JSON**. 

1. Search for "semantic" to find the section in the index for a semantic configuration. Replace the empty `"semantic": {}` line with the following semantic configuration. This example specifies a `"defaultConfiguration"`, which is important to the running of this quickstart.

    ```json
    "semantic":{
       "defaultConfiguration":"semantic-config",
       "configurations":[
          {
             "name":"semantic-config",
             "prioritizedFields":{
                "titleField":{
                   "fieldName":"HotelName"
                },
                "prioritizedContentFields":[
                   {
                      "fieldName":"Description"
                   }
                ],
                "prioritizedKeywordsFields":[
                   {
                      "fieldName":"Category"
                   },
                   {
                      "fieldName":"Tags"
                   }
                ]
             }
          }
       ]
    },
    ```

1. **Save** your changes.

1. Run the following query in [Search Explorer](search-explorer.md) to test your index: `complimentary breakfast`.

   Output should look similar to the following example. Results that are returned directly from the search engine consist of fields and their verbatim values, along with metadata like a search score and a semantic ranking score and caption if you use semantic ranker. We used a [select statement](search-query-odata-select.md) to return just the HotelName, Description, and Tags fields.

   ```

      },
      . . .
   ]}
   ```

## Get service endpoints

In the remaining sections, you set up API calls to Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search. Get the service endpoints so that you can provide them as variables in your code.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. [Find your search service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices).

1. On the **Overview** home page, copy the URL. An example endpoint might look like `https://example.search.windows.net`. 

1. [Find your Azure OpenAI service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.CognitiveServices%2Faccounts).

1. On the **Overview** home page, select the link to view the endpoints. Copy the URL. An example endpoint might look like `https://example.openai.azure.com/`.

## Set up the query and chat thread

This section uses Visual Studio Code and Python to call the chat completion APIs on Azure OpenAI.

1. Start Visual Studio Code and [open the .ipynb file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/main/Quickstart-RAG) or create a new Python file.

1. Install the following Python packages.

   ```python
   ! pip install azure-search-documents==11.6.0b5 --quiet
   ! pip install azure-identity==1.16.1 --quiet
   ! pip install openai --quiet
   ! pip install aiohttp --quiet
   ! pip install ipykernel --quiet
   ```

1. Set the following variables, substituting placeholders with the endpoints you collected in the previous step. 

   ```python
    AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE: str = "PUT YOUR SEARCH SERVICE ENDPOINT HERE"
    AZURE_OPENAI_ACCOUNT: str = "PUT YOUR AZURE OPENAI ENDPOINT HERE"
    AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL: str = "gpt-4o"
   ```

1. Set up clients, the prompt, query, and response.

   For the Azure Government cloud, modify the API endpoint on the token provider to `"https://cognitiveservices.azure.us/.default"`.

   ```python
   # Set up the query for generating responses
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.identity import get_bearer_token_provider
    from azure.search.documents import SearchClient
    from openai import AzureOpenAI
    
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default")
    openai_client = AzureOpenAI(
        api_version="2024-06-01",
        azure_endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_ACCOUNT,
        azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider
    )
    
    search_client = SearchClient(
        endpoint=AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE,
        index_name="hotels-sample-index",
        credential=credential
    )
    
    # This prompt provides instructions to the model
    GROUNDED_PROMPT="""
    You are a friendly assistant that recommends hotels based on activities and amenities.
    Answer the query using only the sources provided below in a friendly and concise bulleted manner.
    Answer ONLY with the facts listed in the list of sources below.
    If there isn't enough information below, say you don't know.
    Do not generate answers that don't use the sources below.
    Query: {query}
    Sources:\n{sources}
    """
    
    # Query is the question being asked. It's sent to the search engine and the LLM.
    query="Can you recommend a few hotels with complimentary breakfast?"
    
    # Set up the search results and the chat thread.
    # Retrieve the selected fields from the search index related to the question.
    search_results = search_client.search(
        search_text=query,
        top=5,
        select="Description,HotelName,Tags"
    )
    sources_formatted = "\n".join([f'{document["HotelName"]}:{document["Description"]}:{document["Tags"]}' for document in search_results])
    
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": GROUNDED_PROMPT.format(query=query, sources=sources_formatted)
            }
        ],
        model=AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL
    )
    
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    Output is from Azure OpenAI, and it consists of recommendations for several hotels. Here's an example of what the output might look like:

    ```
   Sure! Here are a few hotels that offer complimentary breakfast:
   
   - **Head Wind Resort**
   - Complimentary continental breakfast in the lobby
   - Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel
   
   - **Double Sanctuary Resort**
   - Continental breakfast included
   
   - **White Mountain Lodge & Suites**
   - Continental breakfast available
   
   - **Swan Bird Lake Inn**
   - Continental-style breakfast each morning with a variety of food and drinks 
     such as caramel cinnamon rolls, coffee, orange juice, milk, cereal, 
     instant oatmeal, bagels, and muffins
    ```

    If you get a **Forbidden** error message, check Azure AI Search configuration to make sure role-based access is enabled.

    If you get an **Authorization failed** error message, wait a few minutes and try again. It can take several minutes for role assignments to become operational.

    Otherwise, to experiment further, change the query and rerun the last step to better understand how the model works with the grounding data.

    You can also modify the prompt to change the tone or structure of the output.

    You might also try the query without semantic ranking by setting `use_semantic_reranker=False` in the query parameters step. Semantic ranking can noticably improve the relevance of query results and the ability of the LLM to return useful information. Experimentation can help you decide whether it makes a difference for your content.

## Send a complex RAG query

Azure AI Search supports [complex types](search-howto-complex-data-types.md) for nested JSON structures. In the hotels-sample-index, `Address` is an example of a complex type, consisting of `Address.StreetAddress`, `Address.City`, `Address.StateProvince`, `Address.PostalCode`, and `Address.Country`. The index also has complex collection of `Rooms` for each hotel.

If your index has complex types, your query can provide those fields if you first convert the search results output to JSON, and then pass the JSON to the LLM. The following example adds complex types to the request. The formatting instructions include a JSON specification.

```python
import json

# Query is the question being asked. It's sent to the search engine and the LLM.
query="Can you recommend a few hotels that offer complimentary breakfast? 
Tell me their description, address, tags, and the rate for one room that sleeps 4 people."

# Set up the search results and the chat thread.
# Retrieve the selected fields from the search index related to the question.
selected_fields = ["HotelName","Description","Address","Rooms","Tags"]
search_results = search_client.search(
    search_text=query,
    top=5,
    select=selected_fields,
    query_type="semantic"
)
sources_filtered = [{field: result[field] for field in selected_fields} for result in search_results]
sources_formatted = "\n".join([json.dumps(source) for source in sources_filtered])

response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": GROUNDED_PROMPT.format(query=query, sources=sources_formatted)
        }
    ],
    model=AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Output is from Azure OpenAI, and it adds content from complex types.

```
Here are a few hotels that offer complimentary breakfast and have rooms that sleep 4 people:

1. **Head Wind Resort**
   - **Description:** The best of old town hospitality combined with views of the river and

```

## Troubleshooting errors

To debug authentication errors, insert the following code before the step that calls the search engine and the LLM.

```python
import sys
import logging # Set the logging level for all azure-storage-* libraries
logger = logging.getLogger('azure.identity') 
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
formatter = logging.Formatter('[%(levelname)s %(name)s] %(message)s')
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

Rerun the query script. You should now get INFO and DEBUG statements in the output that provide more detail about the issue.

If you see output messages related to ManagedIdentityCredential and token acquisition failures, it could be that you have multiple tenants, and your Azure sign-in is using a tenant that doesn't have your search service. To get your tenant ID, search the Azure portal for "tenant properties" or run `az login tenant list`.

Once you have your tenant ID, run `az login --tenant <YOUR-TENANT-ID>` at a command prompt, and then rerun the script.

## Clean up

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can find and manage resources in the Azure portal by using the **All resources** or **Resource groups** link in the leftmost pane.
