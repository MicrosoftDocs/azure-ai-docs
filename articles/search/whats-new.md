## 2025 announcements

| Month | Type | Announcement |
|-------|------|-------------|
| December | Portal updates | [Knowledge bases](agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base.md) and [knowledge sources](agentic-knowledge-source-overview.md) in the Azure portal have been updated to use the 2025-11-01-preview REST APIs instead of the 2025-08-01-preview. Portal-created knowledge bases now support the [retrieval reasoning effort](agentic-retrieval-how-to-set-retrieval-reasoning-effort.md), and query-time properties (maximum runtime and maximum output size) have been removed from the UI. The portal continues to support search index and blob knowledge sources only; other knowledge source types must be created programmatically.<p>If you previously created knowledge bases or knowledge sources in the portal, those objects still use the 2025-08-01-preview schema. For help with breaking changes, see [Migrate your agentic retrieval code](agentic-retrieval-how-to-migrate.md). |
| November | REST API | [Search Service 2025-11-01-preview](/rest/api/searchservice/operation-groups?view=rest-searchservice-2025-11-01-preview&preserve-view=true) is a new preview REST API version providing programmatic access to the data plane operations described in this table. |
| November | Agentic retrieval | [Semantic ranker and agentic retrieval on free tiers](semantic-search-overview.md) | Both semantic ranker and agentic retrieval are now available on free tiers in [select regions](search-region-support.md), subject to limits on query volume. |
| November | Agentic retrieval | [Knowledge agents renamed to knowledge bases](agentic-retrieval-overview.md). Knowledge sources remain unchanged. This rename introduces breaking changes to REST API routes and properties. For help with migration, see [Migrate your agentic retrieval code](agentic-retrieval-how-to-migrate.md). |
| November | Agentic retrieval | [Knowledge bases (preview)](agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base.md) support new `retrievalInstructions` and `outputConfiguration` properties for improved query planning and execution control. It also provides a new [reasoning effort](agentic-retrieval-how-to-set-retrieval-reasoning-effort.md) for control over LLM processing. |
| November | Agentic retrieval | New types of knowledge sources: [indexed OneLake](agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-onelake.md), [indexed SharePoint](agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-sharepoint-indexed.md), [remote SharePoint](agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-sharepoint-remote.md), and [web](agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-web.md). For indexed knowledge sources, the new `ingestionParameters` object provides properties to control content ingestion and processing, including `contentExtractionMode` for use of the [Azure Content Understanding skill](cognitive-search-skill-content-understanding.md) and `ingestionPermissionOptions` for use of ACLs in the generated indexer. |
| November | Agentic retrieval | Execute retrieval operations with support for [reasoning effort](agentic-retrieval-how-to-set-retrieval-reasoning-effort.md), zero-model-call mode for efficiency, and partial responses. |
| November | Portal update | [Portal support for knowledge sources and knowledge bases (preview)](get-started-portal-agentic-retrieval.md). Use the Azure portal to create and manage knowledge sources and knowledge bases, with a new chat playground for sending retrieval requests. These portal-generated objects use the 2025-08-01-preview schema and have breaking changes with the 2025-11-01-preview. For help with migration, see [Migrate your agentic retrieval code](agentic-retrieval-how-to-migrate.md). |
| November | [Foundry IQ (preview)](/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/what-is-foundry-iq) | New integration that allows agents in Foundry Agent Service to invoke knowledge bases in Azure AI Search. Foundry IQ offloads complex retrieval operations to the knowledge base, enabling the agent to provide accurate, citation-backed responses based on enterprise data and web sources. |
| November | Skills | [Azure Content Understanding skill (preview)](cognitive-search-skill-content-understanding.md) wraps Azure Content Understanding in Foundry Tools to extract structured Markdown from text, images, PDFs, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, and more. This skill provides advanced document parsing with better table extraction (including cross-page tables), image descriptions, and semantic chunking. For indexed knowledge sources, this skill is available through the `contentExtractionMode` property within `ingestionParameters`. |
| November | Security | [SharePoint indexer ACL support (preview)](search-indexer-sharepoint-access-control-lists.md) extends ACL support to flow basic SharePoint permissions to indexed documents, enabling document-level access control. |
| November | Security | [Elevated read permissions for ACLs (preview)](search-query-access-control-rbac-enforcement.md#elevated-permissions-for-investigating-incorrect-results). New capability to assign elevated read permissions to administrators for investigating problems with ACL configurations used in document access control. |

| September | General availability | [Truncate dimensions](vector-search-how-to-truncate-dimensions.md). |
| September | General availability | [Unpack `@search.score` to view subscores in hybrid search results](hybrid-search-ranking.md#unpack-a-search-score-into-subscores). | 
| September | [Updates to import wizards (Phase 1)](search-import-data-portal.md) | The Azure portal is undergoing a three-phase rollout to unify the two import wizards. For Phase 1, the **Import and vectorize data** wizard has been renamed to **Import data (new)** and redeveloped to support keyword search, modernizing the legacy **Import data** workflow with an improved interface and user experience.<p>**Import data (new)** isn't a direct replacement for the old wizard. For example, it supports fewer skills for keyword search.<p>Both wizards are currently available, but **Import data** will be deprecated in a future phase. |
| September | Security | [Support for Azure confidential computing](search-security-overview.md#data-in-use). Configure [confidential computing](/azure/confidential-computing/use-cases-scenarios) during service creation to process data in use on confidential VMs. This compute type isn't intended for general use, but rather for stringent regulatory, compliance, or security requirements.<p>Confidential computing adds a 10% surcharge to the base cost of billable tiers. For more information, see the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).<p>Now generally available through the 2025-05-01 version of [Services - Create or Update (REST API)](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2025-05-01&preserve-view=true) and the [Azure portal](search-create-service-portal.md#choose-a-compute-type). |
| August | REST API | [Search Service 2025-08-01-preview](/rest/api/searchservice/operation-groups?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true). New preview REST API version providing programmatic access to the data plane operations described in this table. |
| August | Agentic retrieval | [Knowledge agents (preview)](agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base.md). Architectural changes to the knowledge agent definition, which now requires one or more `knowledgeSources` instead of `targetIndexes` and deprecates `defaultMaxDocsForReranker`. New `retrievalInstructions` and `outputConfiguration` properties provide greater control over query planning and execution. For help with breaking changes, see [Migrate your agentic retrieval code](agentic-retrieval-how-to-migrate.md). |
| August | Agentic retrieval | [Knowledge sources (preview)](agentic-knowledge-source-overview.md). New REST APIs for creating and managing knowledge sources, which represent content that knowledge agents use to ground and answer queries. In this preview, you can create knowledge sources for [search indexes](agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-search-index.md) and [Azure blobs](agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-blob.md).  |
| August | Agentic retrieval | [Answer synthesis (preview)](agentic-retrieval-how-to-answer-synthesis.md). New `answerSynthesis` modality for knowledge agents. When specified, an LLM generates a natural-language answer as an embedded step in the retrieval pipeline. This differs from the default `extractiveData` modality, which returns raw search results for downstream processing. |
| August | Agentic retrieval | "Fast path" for knowledge agents (preview). (Removed in the 2025-11-01-preview. This documentation no longer exists). The `attemptFastPath` boolean in knowledge agents enabled a shorter processing time if queries are concise and the initial response is sufficiently relevant. Replacement feature is the minimal retrieval reasoning effort. |
| August | Agentic retrieval | [Retrieval instructions (preview)](agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base.md). New `retrievalInstructions` property for knowledge agents guides query planning in an agentic retrieval workflow. For example, you can specify criteria for including or excluding specific knowledge sources.  |
| August | Indexers | [Improved indexer runtime tracking information (preview)](search-howto-run-reset-indexers.md#check-indexer-runtime-quota-for-s3-hd-search-services). Applies to Standard 3 High Density (S3 HD) services only. [Get Service Statistics](/rest/api/searchservice/get-service-statistics/get-service-statistics?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true) response now provides cumulative indexer processing information for the entire service. [Get Status - Indexers](/rest/api/searchservice/indexers/get-status?view=rest-searchservice-2025-08-01-preview&preserve-view=true) provides the same information, but for a specific indexer. |
| August | Vector search | [Strict postfiltering for vector queries (preview)](vector-search-filters.md). New `strictPostFilter` mode for the `vectorFilterMode` parameter. When specified, filters are applied after the global top-`k` vector results are identified, ensuring that returned documents are a subset of the unfiltered results. |
| August | Vector search | [Increased maximum dimensions for vector fields](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#index-limits).  The maximum dimensions per vector field are now `4096`. This update applies to all stable and preview REST API versions that support vectors and doesn't introduce breaking changes. |
| May | Agentic retrieval | [Agentic retrieval (preview)](agentic-retrieval-overview.md) creates a conversational search experience powered by large language models (LLMs) and your proprietary data. Agentic retrieval breaks down complex user queries into subqueries, runs the subqueries in parallel, and extracts grounding data from documents indexed in Azure AI Search. The output is intended for agents and custom chat solutions. A new [knowledge agent](agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base.md) object is introduced in this preview. Its [response payload](agentic-retrieval-how-to-retrieve.md) is designed for downstream agent and chat model consumption, with full transparency of the query plan and reference data. To get started in the portal, see [Quickstart: Agentic retrieval](search-get-started-agentic-retrieval.md). |
| May | Vector search | [Multivector support (preview)](vector-search-multi-vector-fields.md). Index multiple child vectors within a single document field. You can now use vector types in nested fields of complex collections, effectively allowing multiple vectors to be associated with a single document.|
| May | Queries | [Scoring profiles with semantic ranking (preview)​](semantic-how-to-enable-scoring-profiles.md). Semantic ranker adds a new field, `@search.rerankerBoostedScore`, to help you maintain consistent relevance and greater control over final ranking outcomes in your search pipeline. |
| May | Data sources | [Azure Logic Apps integration (preview)](search-how-to-index-logic-apps.md). Create an automated indexing pipeline that retrieves content using a logic app workflow. Use the [Import and vectorize data wizard](search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md) in the Azure portal to build an indexing pipeline based on Azure Logic Apps integration. |
| May | Security | [Document-level access control (preview)](search-document-level-access-overview.md). Flow document-level permissions from blobs in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 to searchable documents in an index. Queries can now filter results based on user identity for selected data sources. |
| May | Multimodal search | [Multimodal search (preview)](multimodal-search-overview.md). Ingest, understand, and retrieve documents that contain text and images, enabling you to perform searches that combine various modalities, such as querying with text to find information embedded in relevant complex images. See [Quickstart: Search for multimodal content](search-get-started-portal-image-search.md) for portal wizard support and [Azure AI Search Multimodal RAG Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-search-multimodal-sample) for a code-first approach. |
| May | Skills | [GenAI prompt skill (preview)](cognitive-search-skill-genai-prompt.md). A new skill that connects to a large language model (LLM) for information, using a prompt you provide. With this skill, you can populate a searchable field using content from an LLM. A primary use case for this skill is *image verbalization*, using an LLM to describe images and send the description to a searchable field in your index. |
| May | Skills |[Document Layout skill (preview)](cognitive-search-skill-document-intelligence-layout.md). New parameters are available for this skill if you use the 2025-05-01-preview API version or later. New parameters support image offset metadata that improves the image search experience. |
| May | Portal update | Import and vectorize data wizard enhancements. This wizard provides two paths for creating and populating vector indexes: [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md) and [Multimodal RAG](search-get-started-portal-image-search.md). Logic apps integration is through the RAG path. |
| May | Index | [Index "description" support (preview)](agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-index.md#add-a-description). The latest preview API adds a description to an index. Consider a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that must pick the correct index at run time. The decision can be  based on the description rather than on the index name alone. The description must be human readable and under four thousand characters.|

| July | General availability | [User-assigned managed identity assignment](search-how-to-managed-identities.md). Now generally available through the `identity` property that associates a user-assigned managed identity with a search service configuration. Only the assignment step, via the [Update Service (REST API)](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/update?view=rest-searchmanagement-2025-05-01&preserve-view=true) or the Azure portal, is generally available. APIs used for data source or model connections that include a user-assigned managed identity are still in preview. |
| July | General availability | [Network security perimeter](search-security-network-security-perimeter.md).  Now generally available through the [Azure Virtual Network Manager REST APIs](/rest/api/networkmanager/), which are used to join a search service, and the [Search Management REST APIs](/rest/api/searchmanagement/network-security-perimeter-configurations?view=rest-searchmanagement-2025-05-01&preserve-view=true), which are used to view and synchronize the configuration settings. Portal support for both steps is also generally available. |
| March | Service | [Service upgrade (preview)](search-how-to-upgrade.md). Upgrade your search service to higher storage limits in your region. With a one-time upgrade, you no longer need to recreate your service. Available in [Upgrade Service (2025-02-01-preview)](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/upgrade?view=rest-searchmanagement-2025-02-01-preview&preserve-view=true) and the Azure portal. |
