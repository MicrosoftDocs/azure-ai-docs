## April 2024

| Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type |  Description |
|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| [Security update addressing information disclosure](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29063) | API | GET responses [no longer return connection strings or keys](search-api-migration.md#breaking-change-for-client-code-that-reads-connection-information). Applies to GET Skillset, GET Index, and GET Indexer. This change helps protect your Azure assets integrated with AI Search from unauthorized access. |
| [More storage on Basic and Standard tiers](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits) | Infrastructure |  Basic now supports up to three partitions and three replicas. Basic and Standard (S1, S2, S3) tiers have significantly more storage per partition, at the same per-partition billing rate. Extra capacity is subject to [regional availability](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits) and applies to new search services created after April 3, 2024. Currently, there's no in-place upgrade, so you must create a new search service to get the extra storage. |
| [More quota for vectors](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#vector-index-size-limits) | Infrastructure | Vector quotas are also higher on new services created after April 3, 2024 in selected regions. |
| [Vector quantization, narrow vector data types, and a new `stored` property (preview)](vector-search-how-to-configure-compression-storage.md) | Feature | Collectively, these three features add vector compression and smarter storage options. First, *scalar quantization* reduces vector index size in memory and on disk. Second, [narrow data types](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types) reduce per-field storage by storing smaller values. Third, you can use `stored` to opt-out of storing the extra copy of a vector that's used only for search results. If you don't need vectors in a query response, you can set `stored` to false to save on space. |
| [2024-03-01-preview Search REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2024-03-01-preview) | API | New preview version of the Search REST APIs for the new data types, vector compression properties, and vector storage options. |
