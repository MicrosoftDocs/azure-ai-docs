# Agentic retrieval in Azure AI Search

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](./includes/previews/preview-generic.md)]

In Azure AI Search, *agentic retrieval* is a new parallel query processing architecture that incorporates user conversation history and Azure OpenAI models to plan, retrieve and synthesize queries for improved results. It produces high-quality grounding data for custom chat and generative AI solutions that include knowledge agents.

Programmatically, agentic retrieval is supported through a new Knowledge Agents object in the 2025-05-01-preview data plane REST API and in Azure SDK prerelease packages that provide the feature. A knowledge agent's retrieval response is designed for downstream consumption by other agents and chat apps.

## Why use agentic retrieval

You should use agentic retrieval when you want to send high quality data to an agent or to ground a chat experience with inputs that include your proprietary content.

The *agentic* aspect is a reasoning step in query planning processing that's performed by a supported large language model (LLM) that you provide. The LLM analyzes the entire chat thread to identify the underlying information need. Instead of a single, catch-all query, the model breaks down compound questions into focused subqueries based on: user questions, chat history, and parameters on the request. The subqueries target your indexed documents (plain text and vectors) in Azure AI Search.This hybrid approach ensures you surface both keyword matches and semantic similarities at once, dramatically improving recall. 

The *retrieval* component is the ability to run subqueries simultaneously, merge results, semantically rank results, and return a three-part response that includes grounding data for the next conversation turn, reference data so that you can inspect the source content, and an activity plan that shows query execution steps.

Query expansion and parallel execution, plus the retrieval response, are the key capabilities of agentic retrieval that make it the best choice for generative AI (RAG) applications.

Agentic retrieval adds latency to query processing, but it makes up for it by adding these capabilities:

+ Reads in chat history as an input to the retrieval pipeline.
+ Rewrites an original query into multiple subqueries using synonym maps (optional) and LLM-generated paraphrasing.
+ Corrects spelling mistakes.
+ Deconstructs a complex query that contains multiple "asks" into component parts. For example: "find me a hotel near the beach, with airport transportation, and that's within walking distance of vegetarian restaurants."
+ Executes all subqueries simultaneously.
+ Outputs a unified result as a single string. Alternatively, you can extract parts of the response for your solution. Metadata about query execution and reference data is included in the response.

Agentic retrieval invokes the entire query processing pipeline multiple times for each query request, but it does so in parallel, preserving the efficiency and performance necessary for a reasonable user experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Including an LLM in query planning adds latency to a query pipeline. You can mitigate the effects by using faster models, such as gpt-4o-mini, and summarizing the message threads. Nonetheless, you should expect longer query times with this pipeline.

## Agentic retrieval architecture

Agentic retrieval is designed for a conversational search experience that includes an LLM. An important part of agentic retrieval is how the LLM breaks down an initial query into subqueries, which are more effective at locating the best matches in your index.

Agentic retrieval has these components:

| Component | Resource | Usage |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| LLM (gpt-4o and gpt-4.1 series) | Azure OpenAI | An LLM has two functions. First, it formulates subqueries for the query plan and sends it back to the knowledge agent. Second, after the query executes, the LLM receives grounding data from the query response and uses it for answer formulation. |
| Search index | Azure AI Search | Contains plain text and vector content, a semantic configuration, and other elements as needed. |
| Knowledge agent | Azure AI Search | Connects to your LLM, providing parameters and inputs to build a query plan. |
| Retrieval engine | Azure AI Search | Executes on the LLM-generated query plan and other parameters, returning a rich response that includes content and query plan metadata. Queries are keyword, vector, and hybrid. Results are merged and ranked. |
| Semantic ranker | Azure AI Search | Provides L2 reranking, promoting the most relevant matches. Semantic ranker is required for agentic retrieval. |

Your solution should include a tool or app that drives the pipeline. An agentic retrieval pipeline concludes with the response object that provides grounding data. Your solution should take it from there, handling the response by passing it to an LLM to generate an answer, which you render inline in the user conversation. For more information about this step, see [Build an agent-to-agent retrieval solution](search-agentic-retrieval-how-to-pipeline.md).

<!-- Insert multiquery pipeline diagram here -->
Agentic retrieval has these processes:

+ Requests for agentic retrieval are initiated by calls to a knowledge agent on Azure AI Search.
+ Knowledge agents connect to an LLM and provide conversation history as input. How much history is configurable by the number of messages you provide.
+ LLMs look at the conversation and determine whether to break it up into subqueries. The number of subqueries depends on what the LLM decides and whether the `maxDocsForReranker` parameter is higher than 50. A new subquery is defined for each 50-document batch sent to semantic ranker.
+ Subqueries execute simultaneously on Azure AI Search and generate structured results and extracted references.
+ Results are ranked and merged.
+ Knowledge agent responses are formulated and returned as a three-part response consisting of a unified result (a long string), a reference array, and an activities array that enumerates all operations.

Your search index determines query execution and any optimizations that occur during query execution. This includes your semantic configuration, as well as optional scoring profiles, synonym maps, analyzers, and normalizers (if you add filters).

## Availability and pricing

Agentic retrieval is available in [all regions that provide semantic ranker](search-region-support.md), on all tiers except the free tier.

Billing for agentic retrieval has two parts:

+ Billing for query planning is pay-as-you-go in Azure OpenAI. It's token based for both input and output tokens. The model you assign to the knowledge agent is the one charged for token usage. For example, if you use gpt-4o, the token charge appears in the bill for gpt-4o.

+ Billing for semantic ranking during query execution. Billing is suspended during the initial roll-out phase but then transitions to pay-as-you-go on the Azure AI Search side through the semantic ranker. Semantic ranker, which is a premium billable feature, is an integral part of agentic retrieval. You're charged on the Azure AI Search side for token inputs to the semantic ranking models.

Semantic ranking is performed for every subquery in the plan. Semantic ranking charges are based on the number of tokens returned by each subquery.

| Aspect | Classic single-query pipeline | Agentic retrieval multi-query pipeline |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Unit | Query based (1,000 queries) per unit of currency| Token based (1 million tokens per unit of currency) |
| Cost per unit | Uniform cost per query | Uniform cost per token |
| Cost estimation | Estimate query count | Estimate token usage |
| Free tier| 1,000 free queries | 50 million free tokens |

> [!NOTE]
> Existing semantic ranker billing is unchanged if you're using it outside of agentic retrieval. For pricing without agentic retrieval, see the [Azure AI Search pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).

### Example: Estimate costs

Agentic retrieval has two billing models: billing from Azure OpenAI (query planning) and billing from Azure AI Search for semantic ranking (query execution).

The prices shown in this article are hypothetical. They're used to illustrate the estimation process. Your costs could be lower. For the actual price of transactions, see [Azure OpenAI pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/#pricing). For query execution, there's no charge for semantic ranking for agentic retrieval in the initial public preview.

#### Estimated billing costs for query planning

To estimate the query plan costs as pay-as-you-go in Azure OpenAI, let's assume gpt-4o-mini:

+ 15 cents for 1 million input tokens.
+ 60 cents for 1 million output tokens.
+ 2,000 input tokens for average chat conversation size.
+ 350 tokens for average output plan size.

#### Estimated billing costs for query execution

To estimate the semantic ranking costs associated with agentic retrieval, start with an idea of what an average document in your index looks like. For example, you might approximate:

+ 10,000 chunks, where each chunk is one to two paragraphs of a PDF.
+ 500 tokens per chunk.
+ Each subquery reranks up to 50 chunks.
+ On average, there are three subqueries per query plan.

#### Calculating price of execution

1. Assume we make 2,000 agentic retrievals with three subqueries per plan. This gives us about 6,000 total queries.

1. Rerank 50 chunks per subquery, which is 300,000 total chunks.

1. Average chunk is 500 tokens, so the total tokens for reranking is 150 million.

1. Given a hypothetical price of 0.022 per token, $3.30 is the total cost for reranking in US dollars.

1. Moving on to query plan costs: 2,000 input tokens multiplied by 2,000 agentic retrievals equal 4 million input tokens for a total of 60 cents.

1. Estimate the output costs based on an average of 350 tokens. If we multiply 350 by 2,000 agentic retrievals, we get 700,000 output tokens total for a total of 42 cents.

Putting it all together, you'd pay about $3.30 for semantic ranking in Azure AI Search, 60 cents for input tokens in Azure OpenAI, and 42 cents for output tokens in Azure OpenAI, for $1.02 for query planning total. The combined cost for the full execution is $4.32.
