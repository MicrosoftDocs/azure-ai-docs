# Document Layout skill

The **Document Layout** skill analyzes a document to detect structure and characteristics, and produces a syntactical representation of the document in Markdown or Text format. You can use it to extract text and images, where image extraction includes location metadata that preserves image position within the document. Image proximity to related content is beneficial in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workloads and [multimodal search](multimodal-search-overview.md) scenarios.

This article is the reference documentation for the Document Layout skill. For usage information, see [How to chunk and vectorize by document layout](search-how-to-semantic-chunking.md). 

This skill uses the [Document Intelligence layout model](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-layout) provided in [Azure AI Document Intelligence](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview).

This skill is bound to a [billable Azure AI multi-service resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md) for transactions that exceed 20 documents per indexer per day. Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existing [Azure AI services Standard price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/).

> [!TIP]
> It's common to use this skill on content such as PDFs that have structure and images. The following tutorials demonstrate image verbalization with two different data chunking techniques:
>
> - [Tutorial: Verbalize images from a structured document layout](tutorial-document-layout-image-verbalization.md)
> - [Tutorial: Vectorize from a structured document layout](tutorial-document-layout-multimodal-embeddings.md)
>

## Limitations

This skill has the following limitations:

+ The skill isn't suitable for large documents requiring more than 5 minutes of processing in the AI Document Intelligence layout model. The skill times out, but charges still apply to the AI Services multi-services resource if it attaches to the skillset for billing purposes. Ensure documents are optimized to stay within processing limits to avoid unnecessary costs.

+ Since this skill calls the Azure AI Document Intelligence layout model, all documented [service behaviors for different document types](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/prebuilt/layout#pages) for different file types apply to its output. For example, Word (DOCX) and PDF files may produce different results due to differences in how images are handled. If consistent image behavior across DOCX and PDF is required, consider converting documents to PDF or reviewing the [multimodal search documentation](multimodal-search-overview.md) for alternative approaches.

## Supported regions

The Document Layout skill calls the [Document Intelligence 2024-11-30 API](/rest/api/aiservices/operation-groups). 

Supported regions vary by modality and how the skill connects to the Document Intelligence layout model.

| Approach | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Import data (new)** wizard](search-import-data-portal.md) | Create an Azure AI multi-service resource in one of these regions to get the portal experience: **East US**, **West Europe**, **North Central US**. | 
| Programmatic, using [Microsoft Entra ID authentication (preview)](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md#bill-through-a-keyless-connection) for billing |  Create Azure AI Search in one of the regions where the service is supported, according to [Product availability by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table). <br>Create the Azure AI multi-service resource in any region listed in the [Product availability by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table) table.|
| Programmatic, using a [multi-service resource API key](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md#bill-through-a-keyless-connection) for billing | Create your Azure AI Search service and AI multi-service resource in the same region. This means that the region chosen must have support for both [Azure AI Search and Azure Document Intelligence services](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table). |

## Supported file formats

This skill recognizes the following file formats.

+ .PDF
+ .JPEG
+ .JPG
+ .PNG
+ .BMP
+ .TIFF
+ .DOCX
+ .XLSX
+ .PPTX
+ .HTML

## Supported languages

Refer to [Azure AI Document Intelligence layout model supported languages](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/language-support/ocr?view=doc-intel-3.1.0&tabs=read-print%2Clayout-print%2Cgeneral#layout&preserve-view=true) for printed text.

## @odata.type

Microsoft.Skills.Util.DocumentIntelligenceLayoutSkill

## Data limits

+ For PDF and TIFF, up to 2,000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
+ Even if the file size for analyzing documents is 500 MB for [Azure AI Document Intelligence paid (S0) tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/) and 4 MB for [Azure AI Document Intelligence free (F0) tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/), indexing is subject to the [indexer limits](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#indexer-limits) of your search service tier.
+ Image dimensions must be between 50 pixels x 50 pixels or 10,000 pixels x 10,000 pixels.
+ If your PDFs are password-locked, remove the lock before running the indexer.
  
## Skill parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive. Several parameters were introduced in specific preview versions of the REST API. We recommend using the generally available version (2025-09-01) or the latest preview (2025-08-01-preview) for full access to all parameters.

| Parameter name     | Allowed Values | Description |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `outputMode`    |`oneToMany` | Controls the cardinality of the output produced by the skill. |
| `markdownHeaderDepth` |`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6(default)` | Only applies if `outputFormat` is set to `markdown`. This parameter describes the deepest nesting level that should be considered. For instance, if the markdownHeaderDepth is `h3`, any sections that are deeper such as `h4`, are rolled into `h3`. |
| `outputFormat`    |`markdown(default)`, `text` | **New**. Controls the format of the output generated by the skill. |
| `extractionOptions`    |`["images"]`, `["images", "locationMetadata"]`, `["locationMetadata"]` | **New**. Identify any extra content extracted from the document. Define an array of enums that correspond to the content to be included in the output. For instance, if the `extractionOptions` is `["images", "locationMetadata"]`, the output includes images and location metadata which provides page location information related to where the content was extracted, such as a page number or section. This parameter applies to both output formats.  |
| `chunkingProperties` | See below. | **New**. Only applies if `outputFormat` is set to `text`. Options that encapsulate how to chunk text content while recomputing other metadata. |

| ChunkingProperties Parameter     | Version | Allowed Values | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `unit`    | `Characters`. currently the only allowed value. Chunk length is measured in characters, as opposed to words or tokens | **New**. Controls the cardinality of the chunk unit. |
| `maximumLength`    | Any integer between 300-50000 | **New**. The maximum chunk length in characters as measured by String.Length. |
| `overlapLength`    | Integer. The value needs to be less than the half of the `maximumLength` | **New**. The length of overlap provided between two text chunks. |

## Skill inputs

| Input name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `file_data` | The file that content should be extracted from. |

The "file_data" input must be an object defined as:

```json
{
  "$type": "file",
  "data": "BASE64 encoded string of the file"
}
```

Alternatively, it can be defined as:

```json
{
  "$type": "file",
  "url": "URL to download file",
  "sasToken": "OPTIONAL: SAS token for authentication if the URL provided is for a file in blob storage"
}
```

The file reference object can be generated in one of following ways:

+ Setting the `allowSkillsetToReadFileData` parameter on your indexer definition to true. This setting creates a path `/document/file_data` that's an object representing the original file data downloaded from your blob data source. This parameter only applies to files in Azure Blob storage.

+ Having a custom skill returning a JSON object definition that provides `$type`, `data`, or `url` and `sastoken`. The `$type` parameter must be set to `file`, and  `data` must be the base 64-encoded byte array of the file content. The `url` parameter must be a valid URL with access for downloading the file at that location.

## Skill outputs

| Output name      | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `markdown_document`    | Only applies if `outputFormat` is set to `markdown`. A collection of "sections" objects, which represent each individual section in the Markdown document.|
| `text_sections`    | Only applies if `outputFormat` is set to `text`. A collection of text chunk objects, which represent the text within the bounds of a page (factoring in any more chunking configured), *inclusive* of any section headers themselves. The text chunk object includes `locationMetadata` if applicable.|
| `normalized_images`    | Only applies if `outputFormat` is set to `text` and `extractionOptions` includes `images`. A collection of images that were extracted from the document, including `locationMetadata` if applicable.|

### Sample definition for markdown output mode

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "description": "Analyze a document",
      "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.DocumentIntelligenceLayoutSkill",
      "context": "/document",
      "outputMode": "oneToMany", 
      "markdownHeaderDepth": "h3", 
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "file_data",
          "source": "/document/file_data"
        }
      ],
      "outputs": [
        {
          "name": "markdown_document", 
          "targetName": "markdown_document" 
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sample output for markdown output mode

```json
{
  "markdown_document": [
    { 
      "content": "Hi this is Jim \r\nHi this is Joe", 
      "sections": { 
        "h1": "Foo", 
        "h2": "Bar", 
        "h3": "" 
      },
      "ordinal_position": 0
    }, 
    { 
      "content": "Hi this is Lance",
      "sections": { 
         "h1": "Foo", 
         "h2": "Bar", 
         "h3": "Boo" 
      },
      "ordinal_position": 1,
    } 
  ] 
}
```

The value of the `markdownHeaderDepth` controls the number of keys in the "sections" dictionary. In the example skill definition, since the `markdownHeaderDepth` is "h3," there are three keys in the "sections" dictionary: h1, h2, h3.

## Example for text output mode and image and metadata extraction

This example demonstrates how to output text content in fixed-sized chunks and extract images along with location metadata from the document.

      "outputFormat": "text",
      "extractionOptions": ["images", "locationMetadata"],
      "chunkingProperties": {     
          "unit": "characters",
          "maximumLength": 2000, 
          "overlapLength": 200

        { 
          "name": "text_sections", 
          "targetName": "text_sections" 
        }, 
        { 
          "name": "normalized_images",

You can override this behavior by setting disabled to true in the indexer definition. Indexer execution is the moment of truth where you find out if there are problems with connections, field mappings, or skillset construction.There are several ways to run an indexer:· Run on indexer creation or update (default).. Run on demand when there are no changes to the definition, or precede with reset for full indexing. For more information, see Run or reset indexers.· Schedule indexer processing to invoke execution at regular intervals.Scheduled execution is usually implemented when you have a need for incremental indexing so that you can pick up the latest changes. As such, scheduling has a dependency on change detection.Indexers are one of the few subsystems that make overt outbound calls to other Azure resources. In terms of Azure roles, indexers don't have separate identities; a connection from the search engine to another Azure resource is made using the system or user- assigned managed identity of a search service. If the indexer connects to an Azure resource on a virtual network, you should create a shared private link for that connection.

Note that the `“sections”` in the sample output above appear blank. To populate them, you’ll need to add an additional skill configured with `outputFormat` set to `markdown`to ensure the sections are properly filled.

The skill uses [Azure AI Document Intelligence](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview) to compute locationMetadata. Refer to [Document Intelligence layout model](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-layout) for details on how pages and bounding polygon coordinates are defined.

The `imagePath` represents the relative path of a stored image. If the knowledge store file projection is configured in the skillset, this path matches the relative path of the image stored in the knowledge store.
