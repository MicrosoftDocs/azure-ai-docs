## Accelerators

An accelerator is an end-to-end solution that includes code and documentation you can adapt for your own implementation of a specific scenario.

| Sample | Description |
|--|--|
| [search-qna-maker-accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-qna-maker-accelerator) | [Solution](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/qna-with-azure-cognitive-search/2081381) that combines Azure AI Search and QnA Maker. See the live [demo site](https://aka.ms/qnaWithAzureSearchDemo). |

## Demos

A demo repo provides proof-of-concept source code for examples or scenarios shown in demonstrations. Unlike accelerators, demo solutions aren't designed for adaptation.
