#	Azure AI Foundry model catalog vectorizer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This vectorizer is in public preview under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). The [2024-05-01-Preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-Preview&preserve-view=true) supports this feature.

The **Azure AI Foundry model catalog** vectorizer connects to an embedding model that was deployed via [the Azure AI Foundry model catalog](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog) to an Azure Machine Learning endpoint. Your data is processed in the [Geo](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/data-residency/) where your model is deployed. 

If you used integrated vectorization to create the vector arrays, the skillset should include an [AML skill pointing to the model catalog in Azure AI Foundry portal](cognitive-search-aml-skill.md).

## Vectorizer parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive. Which parameters you choose to use depends on what [authentication your AML online endpoint requires, if any](#WhatParametersToUse).

| Parameter name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `uri` | (Required) The [URI of the AML online endpoint](../machine-learning/how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md) to which the _JSON_ payload is sent. Only the **https** URI scheme is allowed. |
| `modelName` | (Required) The model ID from the AI Foundry model catalog that is deployed at the provided endpoint. Supported models are: <ul><li>Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Base </li><li>Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Giant </li><li>Cohere-embed-v3-english </li><li>Cohere-embed-v3-multilingual</ul> |
| `key` | (Required for [key authentication](#WhatParametersToUse)) The [key for the AML online endpoint](../machine-learning/how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md). |
| `resourceId` | (Required for [token authentication](#WhatParametersToUse)). The Azure Resource Manager resource ID of the AML online endpoint. It should be in the format subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{workspace-name}/onlineendpoints/{endpoint_name}. |
| `region` | (Optional for [token authentication](#WhatParametersToUse)). The [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions/) the AML online endpoint is deployed in. Needed if the region is different from the region of the search service. |
| `timeout` | (Optional) When specified, indicates the timeout for the http client making the API call. It must be formatted as an XSD "dayTimeDuration" value (a restricted subset of an [ISO 8601 duration](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dayTimeDuration) value). For example, `PT60S` for 60 seconds. If not set, a default value of 30 seconds is chosen. The timeout can be set to a maximum of 230 seconds and a minimum of 1 second. |

## What authentication parameters to use

Which authentication parameters are required depends on what authentication your AML online endpoint uses, if any. AML online endpoints provide two authentication options:

* [Key-Based Authentication](../machine-learning/how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md). A static key is provided to authenticate scoring requests from the vectorizer.
  * Use the _uri_ and _key_ parameters
* [Token-Based Authentication](../machine-learning/how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md). The AML online endpoint is [deployed using token based authentication](../machine-learning/how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md). The Azure AI Search service's [managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) must be enabled. The vectorizer then uses the service's managed identity to authenticate against the AML online endpoint, with no static keys required. The identity must be assigned owner or contributor role.
  * Use the _resourceId_ parameter.
  * If the search service is in a different region from the AML workspace, use the _region_ parameter to set the region the AML online endpoint was deployed in

## Supported vector query types

Which vector query types are supported by the AI Foundry model catalog vectorizer depends on the `modelName` that is configured.

| Embedding model | Supports `text` query | Supports `imageUrl` query | Supports `imageBinary` query |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Base |  | X | X |
| Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Giant |  | X | X |
| Cohere-embed-v3-english | X |  |  |
| Cohere-embed-v3-multilingual | X |  |  |

## Expected field dimensions

The expected field dimensions for a field configured with an AI Foundry model catalog vectorizer depend on the `modelName` that is configured.

| `modelName` | Expected dimensions |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Base | 768 |
| Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Giant | 1536 |
| Cohere-embed-v3-english | 1024 |
| Cohere-embed-v3-multilingual | 1024 |

## Sample definition

Suggested model names in the Azure AI Foundry model catalog consist of the base model plus a random three-letter suffix. The name of your model will be different from the one shown in this example.

```json
"vectorizers": [
    {
        "name": "my-model-catalog-vectorizer",
        "kind": "aml",
        "amlParameters": {
            "uri": "https://Cohere-embed-v3-multilingual-hin.eastus.models.ai.azure.com",
            "key": "aaaaaaaa-0b0b-1c1c-2d2d-333333333333",
            "timeout": "PT60S",
            "modelName": "Cohere-embed-v3-multilingual-hin",
            "resourceId": null,
            "region": null,
        },
    }
]
```
