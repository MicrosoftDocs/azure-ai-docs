# Enable or disable role-based access control in Azure AI Search

Azure AI Search uses [key-based authentication](search-security-api-keys.md) by default, but it fully supports Microsoft Entra ID authentication and authorization for all control plane and data plane operations through Azure role-based access control (RBAC).

Before you can assign roles for authorized data plane access to Azure AI Search, you must enable role-based access control on your search service. Roles for service administration (control plane) are built in and can't be enabled or disabled. 

> [!NOTE]
> *Data plane* refers to operations against the search service endpoint, such as indexing or queries, or any other operation specified in the [Search Service REST APIs](/rest/api/searchservice/) or equivalent Azure SDK client libraries. *Control plane* refers to Azure resource management, such as creating or configuring a search service.

## Prerequisites

+ A search service in any region, on any tier, including free.

+ Owner, User Access Administrator, or a custom role with [Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write](/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/roleassignments) permissions.

## Enable role-based access for data plane operations

Configure your search service to recognize an **authorization** header on data requests that provide an OAuth2 access token.

When you enable roles for the data plane, the change is effective immediately, but wait a few seconds before assigning roles.

The default failure mode for unauthorized requests is `http401WithBearerChallenge`. Alternatively, you can set the failure mode to `http403`. 

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/config-svc-portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open the search service page.

1. Select **Settings** and then select **Keys** in the left navigation pane.

1. Choose **Role-based control** or **Both** if you're currently using keys and need time to transition clients to role-based access control. 

   | Option | Description |
   |--------|--------------|
   | API Key | (default). Requires [API keys](search-security-api-keys.md) on the request header for authorization. |
   | Role-based access control | Requires membership in a role assignment to complete the task. It also requires an authorization header on the request. |
   | Both | Requests are valid using either an API key or role-based access control, but if you provide both in the same request, the API key is used. |

1. As an administrator, if you choose a roles-only approach, [assign data plane roles](search-security-rbac.md) to your user account to restore full administrative access over data plane operations in the Azure portal. Roles include Search Service Contributor, Search Index Data Contributor, and Search Index Data Reader. You need all three roles if you want equivalent access.

   Sometimes it can take five to ten minutes for role assignments to take effect. Until that happens, the following message appears in the Azure portal pages used for data plane operations.

### [**Azure CLI**](#tab/config-svc-cli)

Run this script to support roles only:

```azurecli
az search service update `
  --name YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME `
  --resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME `
  --disable-local-auth
```

Or, run this script to support both keys and roles:

```azurecli
az search service update `
  --name YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME `
  --resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME `
  --aad-auth-failure-mode http401WithBearerChallenge `
  --auth-options aadOrApiKey
```

For more information, see [Manage your Azure AI Search service with the Azure CLI](search-manage-azure-cli.md).

### [**Azure PowerShell**](#tab/config-svc-powershell)

Run this command to set the authentication type to roles only:

```azurepowershell
Set-AzSearchService `
  -Name YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME `
  -ResourceGroupName YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME `
  -DisableLocalAuth 1
```

Or, run this command to support both keys and roles:

```azurepowershell
Set-AzSearchService `
  -Name YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME `
  -ResourceGroupName YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME `
  -AuthOption AadOrApiKey
```

For more information, see [Manage your Azure AI Search service with PowerShell](search-manage-powershell.md).

### [**REST API**](#tab/config-svc-rest)

Use the Management REST API [Create or Update Service](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/create-or-update) to configure your service for role-based access control.

All calls to the Management REST API are authenticated through Microsoft Entra ID. For help with setting up authenticated requests, see [Manage Azure AI Search using REST](search-manage-rest.md).

1. Get service settings so that you can review the current configuration.

   ```http
   GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{{subscriptionId}}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices?api-version=2023-11-01
   ```

1. Use PATCH to update service configuration. The following modifications enable both keys and role-based access. If you want a roles-only configuration, see [Disable API keys](#disable-api-key-authentication).

   Under "properties", set ["authOptions"](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/create-or-update#dataplaneauthoptions) to "aadOrApiKey". The "disableLocalAuth" property must be false to set "authOptions".

   Optionally, set ["aadAuthFailureMode"](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/create-or-update#aadauthfailuremode) to specify whether 401 is returned instead of 403 when authentication fails. Valid values are "http401WithBearerChallenge" or "http403".

    ```http
    PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{{subscriptionId}}/resourcegroups/{{resource-group}}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/{{search-service-name}}?api-version=2023-11-01
    {
        "properties": {
            "disableLocalAuth": false,
            "authOptions": {
                "aadOrApiKey": {
                    "aadAuthFailureMode": "http401WithBearerChallenge"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Disable role-based access control

It's possible to disable role-based access control for data plane operations and use key-based authentication instead. You might do this as part of a test workflow, for example to rule out permission issues.

Reverse the steps you followed previously to enable role-based access.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open the search service page.

1. Select **Settings** and then select **Keys** in the left navigation pane.

1. Select **API Keys**.

## Disable API key authentication

[Key access](search-security-api-keys.md), or local authentication, can be disabled on your service if you're exclusively using the built-in roles and Microsoft Entra authentication. Disabling API keys causes the search service to refuse all data-related requests that pass an API key in the header.

Admin API keys can be disabled, but not deleted. Query API keys can be deleted.

Owner or Contributor permissions are required to disable security features.

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/disable-keys-portal)

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your search service.

1. In the left-navigation pane, select **Keys**.

1. Select **Role-based access control**.

The change is effective immediately, but wait a few seconds before testing. Assuming you have permission to assign roles as a member of Owner, service administrator, or coadministrator, you can use portal features to test role-based access.

### [**Azure CLI**](#tab/disable-keys-cli)

To disable key-based authentication, set -disableLocalAuth to true. This is the same syntax as the "enable roles only" script presented in the previous section.

```azurecli
az search service update `
  --name YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME `
  --resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME `
  --disable-local-auth
```

To re-enable key authentication, set -disableLocalAuth to false. The search service resumes acceptance of API keys on the request automatically (assuming they're specified).

For more information, see [Manage your Azure AI Search service with the Azure CLI](search-manage-azure-cli.md).

### [**Azure PowerShell**](#tab/disable-keys-ps)

To disable key-based authentication, set DisableLocalAuth to true. This is the same syntax as the "enable roles only" script presented in the previous section.

```azurepowershell
Set-AzSearchService `
  -Name YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME `
  -ResourceGroupName YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME `
  -DisableLocalAuth 1
```

To re-enable key authentication, set DisableLocalAuth to false. The search service resumes acceptance of API keys on the request automatically (assuming they're specified).

For more information, see [Manage your Azure AI Search service with PowerShell](search-manage-powershell.md).

### [**REST API**](#tab/disable-keys-rest)

To disable key-based authentication, set "disableLocalAuth" to true.

1. Get service settings so that you can review the current configuration.

   ```http
   GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{{subscriptionId}}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices?api-version=2023-11-01
   ```

1. Use PATCH to update service configuration. The following modification sets "authOptions" to null.

    ```http
    PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{{subscriptionId}}/resourcegroups/{{resource-group}}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/{{search-service-name}}?api-version=2023-11-01
    {
        "properties": {
            "disableLocalAuth": true
        }
    }
    ```

To re-enable key authentication, set "disableLocalAuth" to false. The search service resumes acceptance of API keys on the request automatically (assuming they're specified).

## Effects of role-based access control

+ Role-based access control can increase the latency of some requests. Each unique combination of service resource (index, indexer, skillsets and so forth) and service principal triggers an authorization check. These authorization checks can add up to 200 milliseconds of latency per request. 

+ In rare cases where requests originate from a high number of different service principals, all targeting different service resources (indexes, indexers, and so forth), it's possible for the authorization checks to result in throttling. Throttling would only happen if hundreds of unique combinations of search service resource and service principal were used within a second.
