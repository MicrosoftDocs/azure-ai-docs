# Querying in Azure AI Search

Azure AI Search supports query constructs for a broad range of scenarios, from free-form text search, to highly specified query patterns, to vector search. All queries execute over a search index that stores searchable content.

<a name="types-of-queries"></a>

## Types of queries

| Query form | Searchable content | Description |
|------------|--------------------|-------------|
| [full text search](search-lucene-query-architecture.md) | Inverted indexes of tokenized terms. | Full text queries iterate over inverted indexes that are structured for fast scans, where a match can be found in potentially any field, within any number of search documents. Text is analyzed and tokenized for full text search.|
| [Vector search](vector-search-overview.md) | Vector indexes of generated embeddings. | Vector queries iterate over vector fields in a search index. |
| [Hybrid search](hybrid-search-overview.md) | All of the above, in a single search index. | Combines text search and vector search in a single query request. Text search works on plain text content in "searchable" and "filterable" fields. Vector search works on content in vector fields. |
| Others | Plain text and alphanumeric content.| Raw content, extracted verbatim from source documents, supporting filters and pattern matching queries like geo-spatial search, fuzzy search, and fielded search. |

This article brings focus to the last category: queries that work on plain text and alphanumeric content, extracted intact from original source, used for filters and other specialized query forms.

## Autocomplete and suggested queries

[Autocomplete or suggested results](search-add-autocomplete-suggestions.md) are alternatives to **`search`** that fire successive query requests based on partial string inputs (after each character) in a search-as-you-type experience. You can use **`autocomplete`** and **`suggestions`** parameter together or separately, as described in [this walkthrough](tutorial-csharp-type-ahead-and-suggestions.md), but you can't use them with **`search`**. Both completed terms and suggested queries are derived from index contents. The engine never returns a string or suggestion that is nonexistent in your index. For more information, see [Autocomplete (REST API)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/autocomplete-post) and [Suggestions (REST API)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/suggest-post).

## Filter search

Filters are widely used in apps that are based on Azure AI Search. On application pages, filters are often visualized as facets in link navigation structures for user-directed filtering. Filters are also used internally to expose slices of indexed content. For example, you might initialize a search page using a filter on a product category, or a language if an index contains fields in both English and French.

You might also need filters to invoke a specialized query form, as described in the following table. You can use a filter with an unspecified search (**`search=*`**) or with a query string that includes terms, phrases, operators, and patterns.

| Filter scenario | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Range filters | In Azure AI Search, range queries are built using the filter parameter. For more information and examples, see [Range filter example](search-query-simple-examples.md#example-5-range-filters). |
| Faceted navigation | In [faceted navigation](search-faceted-navigation.md) tree, users can select facets. When backed by filters, search results narrow on each click. Each facet is backed by a filter that excludes documents that no longer match the criteria provided by the facet. |

> [!NOTE]
> Text that's used in a filter expression is not analyzed during query processing. The text input is presumed to be a verbatim case-sensitive character pattern that either succeeds or fails on the match. Filter expressions are constructed using [OData syntax](query-odata-filter-orderby-syntax.md) and passed in a **`filter`** parameter in all *filterable* fields in your index. For more information, see [Filters in Azure AI Search](search-filters.md).

## Geospatial search

Geospatial search matches on a location's latitude and longitude coordinates for "find near me" or map-based search experience. In Azure AI Search, you can implement geospatial search by following these steps:

+ Define a filterable field of one of these types: [Edm.GeographyPoint, Collection(Edm.GeographyPoint, Edm.GeographyPolygon)](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types).
+ Verify the incoming documents include the appropriate coordinates.
+ After indexing is complete, build a query that uses a filter and a [geo-spatial function](search-query-odata-geo-spatial-functions.md). 

Geospatial search uses kilometers for distance. Coordinates are specified in this format: `(longitude, latitude`).

Here's an example of a filter for geospatial search. This filter finds other `Location` fields in the search index that have coordinates within a 300-kilometer radius of the geography point (in this example, Washington D.C.). It returns address information in the result, and includes an optional `facets` clause for self-navigation based on location.

```http
POST https://{{searchServiceName}}.search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-vector-quickstart/docs/search?api-version=2024-07-01
{
    "count": true,
    "search": "*",
    "filter": "geo.distance(Location, geography'POINT(-77.03241 38.90166)') le 300",
    "facets": [ "Address/StateProvince"],
    "select": "HotelId, HotelName, Address/StreetAddress, Address/City, Address/StateProvince",
    "top": 7
}
```

For more information and examples, see [Geospatial search example](search-query-simple-examples.md#example-6-geospatial-search).

## Document look-up

In contrast with the previously described query forms, this one retrieves a single [search document by ID](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/get), with no corresponding index search or scan. Only the one document is requested and returned. When a user selects an item in search results, retrieving the document and populating a details page with fields is a typical response, and a document look-up is the operation that supports it.

## Advanced search: fuzzy, wildcard, proximity, regex

An advanced query form depends on the Full Lucene parser and operators that trigger a specific query behavior.

| Query type | Usage | Examples and more information |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| [Fielded search](query-lucene-syntax.md#bkmk_fields) | **`search`**  parameter, **`queryType=full`**  | Build a composite query expression targeting a single field. <br/>[Fielded search example](search-query-lucene-examples.md#example-1-fielded-search) |
| [fuzzy search](query-lucene-syntax.md#bkmk_fuzzy) | **`search`** parameter, **`queryType=full`** | Matches on terms having a similar construction or spelling. <br/>[Fuzzy search example](search-query-lucene-examples.md#example-2-fuzzy-search) |
| [proximity search](query-lucene-syntax.md#bkmk_proximity) | **`search`** parameter, **`queryType=full`** | Finds terms that are near each other in a document. <br/>[Proximity search example](search-query-lucene-examples.md#example-3-proximity-search) |
| [term boosting](query-lucene-syntax.md#bkmk_termboost) | **`search`** parameter, **`queryType=full`** | Ranks a document higher if it contains the boosted term, relative to others that don't. <br/>[Term boosting example](search-query-lucene-examples.md#example-4-term-boosting) |
| [regular expression search](query-lucene-syntax.md#bkmk_regex) | **`search`** parameter, **`queryType=full`** | Matches based on the contents of a regular expression. <br/>[Regular expression example](search-query-lucene-examples.md#example-5-regex) |
|  [wildcard or prefix search](query-lucene-syntax.md#bkmk_wildcard) | **`search`** parameter with ***`~`** or **`?`**, **`queryType=full`**| Matches based on a prefix and tilde (`~`) or single character (`?`). <br/>[Wildcard search example](search-query-lucene-examples.md#example-6-wildcard-search) |
