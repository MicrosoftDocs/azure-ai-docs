# Monitor Azure AI Search

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-intro.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AI Search doesn't monitor individual user access to content on the search service. If you require this level of monitoring, you need to implement it in your client application.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-types](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-types.md)]

For more information about the resource types for Azure AI Search, see [Azure AI Search monitoring data reference](monitor-azure-cognitive-search-data-reference.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-data-storage](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-data-storage.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-platform-metrics](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-platform-metrics.md)]
In Azure AI Search, platform metrics measure query performance, indexing volume, and skillset invocation. For a list of available metrics for Azure AI Search, see [Azure AI Search monitoring data reference](monitor-azure-cognitive-search-data-reference.md#metrics).

To learn how to analyze query and index performance, see [Analyze performance in Azure AI Search](search-performance-analysis.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the logs schemas for Azure AI Search, see [Azure AI Search monitoring data reference](monitor-azure-cognitive-search-data-reference.md#resource-logs).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]

In Azure AI Search, activity logs reflect control plane activity such as service creation and configuration, or API key usage or management. Entries often include **Get Admin Key**, one entry for every call that [provided an admin API key](search-security-api-keys.md) on the request. There are no details about the call itself, just a notification that the admin key was used.

The following screenshot shows Azure AI Search activity log signals you can configure in an alert.

For other entries, see the [Management REST API reference](/rest/api/searchmanagement/) for control plane activity that might appear in the log.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]

The following queries can get you started. See [Analyze performance in Azure AI Search](search-performance-analysis.md) for more examples and guidance specific to search service.

#### List metrics by name

Return a list of metrics and the associated aggregation. The query is scoped to the current search service over the time range that you specify.

```kusto
AzureMetrics
| project MetricName, Total, Count, Maximum, Minimum, Average
```

#### List operations by name

Return a list of operations and a count of each one.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| summarize count() by OperationName
```

#### Long-running queries

This Kusto query against AzureDiagnostics returns `Query.Search` operations, sorted by duration (in milliseconds). For more examples of `Query.Search` queries, see [Analyze performance in Azure AI Search](search-performance-analysis.md).

```Kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| project OperationName, resultSignature_d, DurationMs, Query_s, Documents_d, IndexName_s
| where OperationName == "Query.Search"
| sort by DurationMs   
```

#### Indexer status

This Kusto query returns the status of indexer operations. Results include the operation name, description of the request (which includes the name of the indexer), result status (Success or Failure), and the [HTTP status code](/rest/api/searchservice/http-status-codes). For more information about indexer execution, see [Monitor indexer status](search-howto-monitor-indexers.md).

```Kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| project OperationName, Description_s, Documents_d, ResultType, resultSignature_d
| where OperationName == "Indexers.Status"
```

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-alerts](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-alerts.md)]

### Azure AI Search alert rules
The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Azure AI Search. On a search service, throttling or query latency that exceeds a given threshold are the most commonly used alerts, but you might also want to be notified if a search service is deleted.

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Search Latency (metric alert) | Whenever the average search latency is greater than a user-specified threshold (in  seconds) | Send an SMS alert when average query response time exceeds the threshold. |
| Throttled search queries percentage (metric alert) | Whenever the total throttled search queries percentage is greater than or equal to a user-specified threshold | Send an SMS alert when dropped queries begin to exceed the threshold.|
| Delete Search Service (activity log alert) | Whenever the Activity Log has an event with Category='Administrative', Signal name='Delete Search Service (searchServices)', Level='critical' | Send an email if a search service is deleted in the subscription. |
