If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
cargo add foundry-local-sdk --features winml
cargo add tokio --features full
cargo add tokio-stream anyhow
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
cargo add foundry-local-sdk
cargo add tokio --features full
cargo add tokio-stream anyhow
```
