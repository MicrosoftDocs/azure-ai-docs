## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed.

## Samples repository

You can find the sample in this article in the [Foundry Local SDK Samples GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/foundrylocalSDK).

## Set up project

[!INCLUDE [project-setup](../python-project-setup.md)]

Install the OpenAI SDK:

```bash
pip install openai
```

## Understanding tool choice settings

The tool choice parameter controls whether and how the model invokes the tools you provide. THe parameter is sent as part of the chat completion request alongside your tool definitions.

Different models have different capabilities when it comes to tool calling, but in general you can expect the following behavior for each option:

| Option | Value | Behavior | Reliability |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Auto** | `"auto"` | The model decides whether to call a tool or respond directly, based on the user's message and the available tool definitions. | Reliable across all tool-calling models |
| **None** | `"none"` | The model won't call any tools, even if tools are provided in the request. | Reliable across all tool-calling models |
| **Required** | `"required"` | The model must call at least one tool. | Best-effort |
| **Specific function** | `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` | The model must call the specified function. | Best-effort |

## Use chat completions with tool calling

Copy and paste the following code into a Python file named `app.py`:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/tool-calling/src/app.py" id="complete_code":::

## Run the application

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```
