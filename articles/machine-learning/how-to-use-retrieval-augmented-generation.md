# Get started with RAG using a prompt flow sample (preview)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use RAG by creating a prompt flow. A prompt is an input, a text command or a question provided to an AI model, to generate desired output like content or answer. The process of crafting effective and efficient prompts is called prompt design or prompt engineering. [prompt flow](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/harness-the-power-of-large-language-models-with-azure-machine/ba-p/3828459) is the interactive editor of Azure Machine Learning for prompt engineering projects. To get started, you can create a prompt flow sample, which uses RAG from the samples gallery in Azure Machine Learning. You can use this sample to learn how to use Vector Index in a prompt flow.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* Access to Azure OpenAI. 

* Enable prompt flow in your Azure Machine Learning workspace

In your Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can enable prompt flow by turn-on **Build AI solutions with Prompt flow** in the **Manage preview features** panel.


## Create a prompt flow using the samples gallery

1.  Select **Prompt flow** on the left menu.

2.  Select **Create**.

3. In the **Explore gallery** menu, select **View Detail** on the _Q&A on Your Data_ sample.
