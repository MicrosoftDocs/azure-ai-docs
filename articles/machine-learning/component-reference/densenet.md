# DenseNet

This article describes how to use the **DenseNet** component in Azure Machine Learning designer, to create an image classification model using the Densenet algorithm.  

This classification algorithm is a supervised learning method, and requires a labeled image directory. 

> [!NOTE]
> This component does not support labeled dataset generated from *Data Labeling* in the studio, but only support labeled image directory generated from [Convert to Image Directory](convert-to-image-directory.md) component. 

You can train the model by providing the model and the labeled image directory as inputs to [Train PyTorch Model](train-pytorch-model.md). The trained model can then be used to predict values for the new input examples using [Score Image Model](score-image-model.md).

### More about DenseNet

For more information on DenseNet, see the research paper, [Densely Connected Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993).

## How to configure DenseNet

1.  Add the **DenseNet** component to your pipeline in the designer.  

2.  For **Model name**, specify name of a certain DenseNet structure and you can select from supported DenseNet: 'densenet121', 'densenet161', 'densenet169', 'densenet201'.

3.  For **Pretrained**, specify whether to use a model pre-trained on ImageNet. If selected, you can fine-tune model based on selected pre-trained model; if deselected, you can train from scratch.

4.  For **Memory efficient**, specify whether to use checkpointing, which is much more memory-efficient but slower. For more information, see the research paper, [Memory-Efficient Implementation of DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06990.pdf).

5.  Connect the output of **DenseNet** component, training, and validation image dataset component to the [Train PyTorch Model](train-pytorch-model.md). 

6. Submit the pipeline.


## Results

After pipeline run is completed, to use the model for scoring, connect the [Train PyTorch Model](train-pytorch-model.md) to [Score Image Model](score-image-model.md), to predict values for new input examples.
