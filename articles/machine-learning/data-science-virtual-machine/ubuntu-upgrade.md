# Upgrade your Data Science Virtual Machine to Ubuntu 20.04

If you have a Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) that runs an older release, such as Ubuntu 18.04, you should migrate your DSVM to Ubuntu 20.04. This migration ensures that you get the latest operating system patches, drivers, preinstalled software, and library versions. This document tells you how to migrate from older Ubuntu versions.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with SSH and the Linux command line

## Overview

You have two migration options:

- In-place migration, also called "same server" migration. This option upgrades the existing VM without creation of a new virtual machine. In-place migration is the easier way to migrate from Ubuntu 18.04 to Ubuntu 20.04.
- Side-by-side migration, also called "inter-server" migration. This option transfers data from the existing virtual machine to a newly created VM. You might prefer side-by-side migration for upgrades between Ubuntu versions if you believe that your old install became needlessly cluttered.

## Snapshot your VM in case you need to roll back

In the Azure portal, use the search bar to find the **Snapshots** functionality.

:::image type="content" source="media/ubuntu_upgrade/azure-portal-search-bar.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure portal and search bar, with **Snapshots** highlighted.":::

1. Select **Add**, to take you to the **Create snapshot** page. Select the subscription and resource group of your virtual machine. For **Region**, select the same region in which the target storage exists. Select the DSVM storage disk and other backup options. **Standard HDD** is an appropriate storage type for this backup scenario.
   :::image type="content" source="media/ubuntu_upgrade/create-snapshot-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing 'Create snapshot' options." lightbox="media/ubuntu_upgrade/create-snapshot-options.png":::
1. After you fill in the details and the validations pass, select **Review + create** to validate and create the snapshot. When the snapshot successfully completes, a message appears to tell you that the deployment is complete.

## In-place migration

To migrate an older Ubuntu release, you might choose an in-place migration option. This migration doesn't create a new virtual machine and it has fewer steps compared to a side-by-side migration. For more control, or for a migration from a different distribution, consider a side-by-side migration. For more information, skip to the [Side-by-side migration](#side-by-side-migration) section of this document.

1. From the Azure portal, launch your DSVM, and sign in with SSH. To do so, select **Connect** and **SSH**, and follow the connection instructions.

1. Once you connect to a terminal session on your DSVM, run this upgrade command:

    ```bash
    sudo do-release-upgrade
    ```

The upgrade process takes a while to complete. After it finishes, the program will request your permission to restart the virtual machine. Answer **Yes**, to disconnect from the SSH session as the system reboots.

### If necessary, regenerate SSH keys

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you upgrade and reboot, you might need to regenerate your SSH keys.

After your VM upgrades and reboots, try to access it again via SSH. The IP address might change during the reboot, so confirm it before you try to connect.

If you receive the error **REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED**, you must regenerate your SSH credentials.

:::image type="content" source="media/ubuntu_upgrade/remote-host-warning.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing PowerShell remote host identification changed warning." lightbox="media/ubuntu_upgrade/remote-host-warning.png":::

To do so on your local machine, run this command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R "your server hostname or ip"
```

You should now be able to connect with SSH. If you still have trouble, follow the link to **Troubleshoot SSH connectivity issues** at the **Connect** page.

## Side-by-side migration

For a clean OS install, you can do a side-by-side migration. This migration type has more steps, but offers more control over the exact files that carry over.

Migrations from other systems based on the same set of upstream source packages should be relatively straightforward.

You can upgrade the operating system parts of the filesystem, and leave the user directories, for example `/home`, in place. If you do leave the old user home directories in place, you can expect some problems with the GNOME/KDE menus and other desktop items. It might be easier to create new user accounts, and mount the old directories somewhere else in the filesystem. This is done for purposes of reference, copying, or linking users' material after the migration.

### Migration at a glance

1. Create a snapshot of your existing VM as described [previously](#snapshot-your-vm-in-case-you-need-to-roll-back).
1. Create a disk from that snapshot.
1. Create a new Ubuntu DSVM.
1. Recreate user account(s) on the new virtual machine.
1. Mount the disk of the snapshotted VM as a data disk on your new DSVM.
1. Manually copy the relevant data.

### Create a disk from your VM snapshot

Create a VM snapshot as described previously, if you haven't yet done so.

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Disks** and select **Add**. This opens the **Disk** page

:::image type="content" source="media/ubuntu_upgrade/portal-disks-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing search for Disks page and the Add button." lightbox="media/ubuntu_upgrade/portal-disks-search.png":::

2. Set the **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and **Region** to the values of your VM snapshot. Choose a **Name** for the disk to be created

3. Select **Source type** as **Snapshot** and select the VM snapshot as the **Source snapshot**. Review and create the disk

:::image type="content" source="media/ubuntu_upgrade/disk-create-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of disk creation dialog showing the available options." lightbox="media/ubuntu_upgrade/disk-create-options.png":::

### Create a new Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine

Create a new Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine with the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or an [ARM template](./dsvm-tutorial-resource-manager.md).

### Re-create user account(s) on your new Data Science Virtual Machine

Since you'll only copy data from your old computer, you must re-create the user accounts and software environments that you want to use on the new machine.

Linux has enough flexibility to allow you to customize directories and paths on your new installation, to mirror your old machine. In general, however, it's easier to use the preferred layout of modern Ubuntu, and modify your user environment and scripts to adapt.

For more information, visit [Quickstart: Set up the Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu)](./dsvm-ubuntu-intro.md).

### Mount the disk of the snapshotted VM as a data disk on your new Data Science Virtual Machine

1. In the Azure portal, verify that your Data Science Virtual Machine is running
1. In the Azure portal, go to the page of your DSVM. Choose the **Disks** blade on the left rail. Choose **Attach existing disks**
1. In the **Disk name** dropdown, select the disk that you created from your old VM's snapshot
:::image type="content" source="media/ubuntu_upgrade/attach-data-disk.png" alt-text="Screenshot of DSVM options page showing disk attachment options." lightbox="media/ubuntu_upgrade/attach-data-disk.png":::
1. Select **Save** to update your virtual machine.

> [!Important]
> Your VM should be running at the time you attach the data disk. If the VM isn't running, the disks might get added in an incorrect order. This leads to a confusing and potentially non-bootable system. If you add the data disk with the VM off, choose the **X** beside the data disk, start the VM, and re-attach it.

### Manually copy the wanted data

1. Sign on to your running virtual machine using SSH
1. Confirm that you attached the disk created from the snapshot of your old VM by running this command:

    ```bash
    lsblk -o NAME,HCTL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | grep -i 'sd'
    ```

    The results should resemble the next image. In the image, disk `sda1` is mounted at the root and `sdb2` is the `/mnt` scratch disk. The data disk created from the snapshot of your old VM is identified as `sdc1`, but isn't yet available, as evidenced by the lack of a mount location. Your results might have different identifiers, but you should see a similar pattern.

    :::image type="content" source="media/ubuntu_upgrade/lsblk-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of lsblk output, showing unmounted data drive." lightbox="media/ubuntu_upgrade/lsblk-results.png":::

1. To access the data drive, create a location for it and mount it. Replace `/dev/sdc1` with the appropriate value that `lsblk` returns:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /datadrive && sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /datadrive
    ```

1. The `/datadrive` resource contains the directories and files of your old DSVM. Move or copy the directories or files you want from the data drive to the new VM as you wish.

## Connect and confirm version upgrade

For either an in-place or side-by-side migration, verify that the upgrade succeeded. From a terminal session, run:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

The terminal should show that you're running Ubuntu 20.04.

:::image type="content" source="media/ubuntu_upgrade/ssh-os-release.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Ubuntu terminal showing OS version data." lightbox="media/ubuntu_upgrade/ssh-os-release.png":::

The Azure portal also shows the version change.
