# Advance your maturity level for Generative Artificial Intelligence Operations (GenAIOps)

Generative Artificial Intelligence Operations, or **GenAIOps** (sometimes called LLMOps), describes the operational practices and strategies for managing large language models (LLMs) in production. This article provides guidance on how to advance your capabilities in GenAIOps, based on your organization's current maturity level.

**Description:** Your organization is at the initial foundational stage of GenAIOps maturity. You're exploring the capabilities of LLMs but haven't yet developed structured practices or systematic approaches.

Begin by familiarizing yourself with different LLM APIs and their capabilities. Next, start experimenting with structured prompt design and basic prompt engineering. Review ***Microsoft Learn*** articles as a starting point. Taking what you've learned, discover how to introduce basic metrics for LLM application performance evaluation.

> Score from [GenAIOps Maturity Model Assessment](/assessments/e14e1e9f-d339-4d7e-b2bb-24f056cf08b6/): maturing (10-14).

**Description:** Your organization has started to systematize LLM operations, with a focus on structured development and experimentation. However, there's room for more sophisticated integration and optimization.

To improve your capabilities and skills, learn how to develop more complex prompts and integrate them effectively into applications. Implement a systematic approach for LLM application deployment, possibly exploring CI/CD integration. Begin employing more advanced evaluation metrics like groundedness, relevance, and similarity. Focus on content safety and ethical considerations in LLM usage.
