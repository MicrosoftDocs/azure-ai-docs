# Train a model by using a custom Docker image

[!INCLUDE [sdk v1](../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

This article describes how to use a custom Docker image to train models with Azure Machine Learning. Example scripts show how to classify images by creating a convolutional neural network. 

Azure Machine Learning provides a default Docker base image. You can also use Azure Machine Learning environments to specify a different base image, such as a maintained [Azure Machine Learning base image](https://github.com/Azure/AzureML-Containers) or your own [custom image](../how-to-deploy-custom-container.md). Custom base images allow you to closely manage your dependencies and maintain tighter control over component versions when you run training jobs.

## Prerequisites

To run the example code, your configuration must include one of the following environments:

- Azure Machine Learning compute instance with a dedicated notebook server preloaded with the Machine Learning SDK and Samples repository.

   This configuration requires no downloads or other installation. To prepare this environment, see [Create resources to get started](../quickstart-create-resources.md).

- Jupyter Notebook server. The following resources provide instructions to help you prepare this environment:

   - Create a [workspace configuration file](../how-to-configure-environment.md#local-and-dsvm-only-create-a-workspace-configuration-file).
   - Install the [Azure Machine Learning SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install).
   - Create an [Azure container registry](/azure/container-registry/) or other Docker registry available on the internet.

## Set up a training experiment

The first task is to set up your training experiment by initializing a Machine Learning workspace, defining your environment, and configuring a compute target.

### Initialize a workspace

The [Azure Machine Learning workspace](../concept-workspace.md) is the top-level resource for the service. It gives you a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create. In the Python SDK, you can access the workspace artifacts by creating a [`Workspace`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace.workspace) object.

As needed, create a `Workspace` object from the config.json file that you created as a [prerequisite](#prerequisites).

```Python
from azureml.core import Workspace

ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

### Define your environment

Create an `Environment` object.

```python
from azureml.core import Environment

fastai_env = Environment("fastai2")
```

The specified base image in the following code supports the fast.ai library, which allows for distributed deep-learning capabilities. For more information, see the [fast.ai Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/fastdotai). 

When you use your custom Docker image, you might already have your Python environment properly set up. In that case, set the `user_managed_dependencies` flag to `True` to use your custom image's built-in Python environment. By default, Azure Machine Learning builds a Conda environment with dependencies that you specified. The service runs the script in that environment instead of using any Python libraries that you installed on the base image.

```python
fastai_env.docker.base_image = "fastdotai/fastai2:latest"
fastai_env.python.user_managed_dependencies = True
```

#### Use a private container registry (optional)

To use an image from a private container registry that isn't in your workspace, use `docker.base_image_registry` to specify the address of the repository and a username and password:

```python
# Set the container registry information
fastai_env.docker.base_image_registry.address = "myregistry.azurecr.io"
fastai_env.docker.base_image_registry.username = "username"
fastai_env.docker.base_image_registry.password = "password"
```

#### Use a custom Dockerfile (optional)

It's also possible to use a custom Dockerfile. Use this approach if you need to install non-Python packages as dependencies. Remember to set the base image to `None`.

```python 
# Specify Docker steps as a string
dockerfile = r"""
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04:20210615.v1
RUN echo "Hello from custom container!"
"""

# Set the base image to None, because the image is defined by Dockerfile
fastai_env.docker.base_image = None
fastai_env.docker.base_dockerfile = dockerfile

# Alternatively, load the string from a file
fastai_env.docker.base_image = None
fastai_env.docker.base_dockerfile = "./Dockerfile"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Machine Learning only supports Docker images that provide the following software:
> * Ubuntu 18.04 or greater
> * Conda 4.7.# or greater
> * Python 3.7+
> * A POSIX compliant shell available at /bin/sh is required in any container image used for training

For more information about creating and managing Azure Machine Learning environments, see [Create and use software environments](../how-to-use-environments.md). 

### Create or attach a compute target

You need to create a [compute target](concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md#compute-targets) for training your model. In this tutorial, you create `AmlCompute` as your training compute resource.

Creation of `AmlCompute` takes a few minutes. If the `AmlCompute` resource is already in your workspace, this code skips the creation process.

As with other Azure services, there are limits on certain resources (for example, `AmlCompute`) associated with the Azure Machine Learning service. For more information, see [Default limits and how to request a higher quota](../how-to-manage-quotas.md).

```python
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute
from azureml.core.compute_target import ComputeTargetException

# Choose a name for your cluster
cluster_name = "gpu-cluster"

try:
    compute_target = ComputeTarget(workspace=ws, name=cluster_name)
    print('Found existing compute target.')
except ComputeTargetException:
    print('Creating a new compute target...')
    compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size='STANDARD_NC6',
                                                           max_nodes=4)

    # Create the cluster
    compute_target = ComputeTarget.create(ws, cluster_name, compute_config)

    compute_target.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)

# Use get_status() to get a detailed status for the current AmlCompute
print(compute_target.get_status().serialize())
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use CPU SKUs for any image build on compute. 

## Configure your training job

For this tutorial, use the training script *train.py* on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/v1-archive/v1/python-sdk/workflows/train/fastai/pets/src/train.py). In practice, you can take any custom training script and run it, as is, with Azure Machine Learning.

Create a `ScriptRunConfig` resource to configure your job for running on the desired [compute target](how-to-set-up-training-targets.md).

```python
from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig

src = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='fastai-example',
                      script='train.py',
                      compute_target=compute_target,
                      environment=fastai_env)
```

## Submit your training job

When you submit a training run by using a `ScriptRunConfig` object, the `submit` method returns an object of type `ScriptRun`. The returned `ScriptRun` object gives you programmatic access to information about the training run. 

```python
from azureml.core import Experiment

run = Experiment(ws,'Tutorial-fastai').submit(src)
run.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
```

> [!WARNING]
> Azure Machine Learning runs training scripts by copying the entire source directory. If you have sensitive data that you don't want to upload, use an [.ignore file](../concept-train-machine-learning-model.md#understand-what-happens-when-you-submit-a-training-job) or don't include it in the source directory. Instead, access your data by using a [datastore](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data).
