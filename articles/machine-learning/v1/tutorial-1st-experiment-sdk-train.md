# Tutorial: Train your first machine learning model (SDK v1, part 2 of 3)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v1](../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [v1 deprecation](../includes/sdk-v1-deprecation.md)]


This tutorial shows you how to train a machine learning model in Azure Machine Learning. This tutorial is *part 2 of a two-part tutorial series*.

 In [Part 1: Run "Hello world!"](tutorial-1st-experiment-hello-world.md) of the series, you learned how to use a control script to run a job in the cloud. 

In this tutorial, you take the next step by submitting a script that trains a machine learning model. This example helps you understand how Azure Machine Learning eases consistent behavior between local debugging and remote runs.

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a training script.
> * Use Conda to define an Azure Machine Learning environment.
> * Create a control script.
> * Understand Azure Machine Learning classes (`Environment`, `Run`, `Metrics`).
> * Submit and run your training script.
> * View your code output in the cloud.
> * Log metrics to Azure Machine Learning.
> * View your metrics in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [part 1](tutorial-1st-experiment-hello-world.md) of the series.

## Create training scripts

First you define the neural network architecture in a *model.py* file. All your training code goes into the `src` subdirectory, including *model.py*.

The training code is taken from [this introductory example](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) from PyTorch. The Azure Machine Learning concepts apply to any machine learning code, not just PyTorch.

1. Create a *model.py* file in the **src** subfolder. Copy this code into the file:

    ```python
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F
    
    
    class Net(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(Net, self).__init__()
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
            self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
            self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)
    
        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
            x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
            x = self.fc3(x)
            return x
    ```
1. On the toolbar, select **Save** to save the file. Close the tab if you wish.

1. Next, define the training script, also in the **src** subfolder. This script downloads the CIFAR10 dataset by using PyTorch `torchvision.dataset` APIs, sets up the network defined in *model.py*, and trains it for two epochs by using standard SGD and cross-entropy loss.

    Create a *train.py* script in the **src** subfolder:

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.optim as optim
    import torchvision
    import torchvision.transforms as transforms
    
    from model import Net
    
    # download CIFAR 10 data
    trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(
        root="../data",
        train=True,
        download=True,
        transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(),
    )
    trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        trainset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True, num_workers=2
    )
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    
        # define convolutional network
        net = Net()
    
        # set up pytorch loss /  optimizer
        criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
    
        # train the network
        for epoch in range(2):
    
            running_loss = 0.0
            for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
                # unpack the data
                inputs, labels = data
    
                # zero the parameter gradients
                optimizer.zero_grad()
    
                # forward + backward + optimize
                outputs = net(inputs)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
    
                # print statistics
                running_loss += loss.item()
                if i % 2000 == 1999:
                    loss = running_loss / 2000
                    print(f"epoch={epoch + 1}, batch={i + 1:5}: loss {loss:.2f}")
                    running_loss = 0.0
    
        print("Finished Training")
    ```

1. You now have the following folder structure:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-train/directory-structure.png" alt-text="Directory structure shows train.py in src subdirectory":::


## Test locally

Select **Save and run script in terminal** to run the *train.py* script directly on the compute instance.

After the script completes, select **Refresh** above the file folders. You see the new data folder called **get-started/data** Expand this folder to view the downloaded data.

## Create a Python environment

Azure Machine Learning provides the concept of an [environment](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.environment.environment) to represent a reproducible, versioned Python environment for running experiments. It's easy to create an environment from a local Conda or pip environment.

First you create a file with the package dependencies.

1. Create a new file in the **get-started** folder called `pytorch-env.yml`:
    
    ```yml
    name: pytorch-env
    channels:
        - defaults
        - pytorch
    dependencies:
        - python=3.7
        - pytorch
        - torchvision
    ```
1. On the toolbar, select **Save** to save the file. Close the tab if you wish.

## Create the control script

The difference between the following control script and the one that you used to submit "Hello world!" is that you add a couple of extra lines to set the environment.

Create a new Python file in the **get-started** folder called `run-pytorch.py`:

```python
# run-pytorch.py
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.core import Experiment
from azureml.core import Environment
from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ws = Workspace.from_config()
    experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='day1-experiment-train')
    config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='./src',
                             script='train.py',
                             compute_target='cpu-cluster')

    # set up pytorch environment
    env = Environment.from_conda_specification(
        name='pytorch-env',
        file_path='pytorch-env.yml'
    )
    config.run_config.environment = env

    run = experiment.submit(config)

    aml_url = run.get_portal_url()
    print(aml_url)
```

> [!TIP]
> If you used a different name when you created your compute cluster, make sure to adjust the name in the code `compute_target='cpu-cluster'` as well.

### Understand the code changes

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `env = ...`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      References the dependency file you created above.
   :::column-end:::

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `config.run_config.environment = env`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Adds the environment to [ScriptRunConfig](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.scriptrunconfig).
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Submit the run to Azure Machine Learning

1. Select **Save and run script in terminal** to run the *run-pytorch.py* script.

1. You see a link in the terminal window that opens. Select the link to view the job.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may see some warnings starting with *Failure while loading azureml_run_type_providers...*. You can ignore these warnings. Use the link at the bottom of these warnings to view your output.

### View the output

1. In the page that opens, you see the job status. The first time you run this script, Azure Machine Learning builds a new Docker image from your PyTorch environment. The whole job might take around 10 minutes to complete. This image will be reused in future jobs to make them run much quicker.
1. You can see view Docker build logs in the Azure Machine Learning studio. to view the build logs:
    1. Select the **Outputs + logs** tab.
    1. Select **azureml-logs** folder.
    1. Select **20_image_build_log.txt**.
1. When the status of the job is **Completed**, select **Output + logs**.
1. Select **user_logs**, then **std_log.txt** to view the output of your job.

```txt
Downloading https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz to ../data/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

epoch=2, batch=10000: loss 1.49
epoch=2, batch=12000: loss 1.46
Finished Training
```

If you see an error `Your total snapshot size exceeds the limit`, the **data** folder is located in the `source_directory` value used in `ScriptRunConfig`.

Select the **...** at the end of the folder, then select **Move** to move **data** to the **get-started** folder. 


## Log training metrics

Now that you have a model training in Azure Machine Learning, start tracking some performance metrics.

The current training script prints metrics to the terminal. Azure Machine Learning provides a mechanism for logging metrics with more functionality. By adding a few lines of code, you gain the ability to visualize metrics in the studio and to compare metrics between multiple jobs.

### Modify *train.py* to include logging

1. Modify your *train.py* script to include two more lines of code:
    
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.optim as optim
    import torchvision
    import torchvision.transforms as transforms
    from model import Net
    from azureml.core import Run
    
    
    # ADDITIONAL CODE: get run from the current context
    run = Run.get_context()
    
    # download CIFAR 10 data
    trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(
        root='./data',
        train=True,
        download=True,
        transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()
    )
    trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        trainset,
        batch_size=4,
        shuffle=True,
        num_workers=2
    )
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # define convolutional network
        net = Net()
        # set up pytorch loss /  optimizer
        criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
        # train the network
        for epoch in range(2):
            running_loss = 0.0
            for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
                # unpack the data
                inputs, labels = data
                # zero the parameter gradients
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                # forward + backward + optimize
                outputs = net(inputs)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
                # print statistics
                running_loss += loss.item()
                if i % 2000 == 1999:
                    loss = running_loss / 2000
                    # ADDITIONAL CODE: log loss metric to AML
                    run.log('loss', loss)
                    print(f'epoch={epoch + 1}, batch={i + 1:5}: loss {loss:.2f}')
                    running_loss = 0.0
        print('Finished Training')
    ```

2. **Save** this file, then close the tab if you wish.

#### Understand the additional two lines of code

In *train.py*, you access the run object from _within_ the training script itself by using the `Run.get_context()` method and use it to log metrics:

```python
# ADDITIONAL CODE: get run from the current context
run = Run.get_context()

...
# ADDITIONAL CODE: log loss metric to AML
run.log('loss', loss)
```

Metrics in Azure Machine Learning are:

- Organized by experiment and run, so it's easy to keep track of and
compare metrics.
- Equipped with a UI so you can visualize training performance in the studio.
- Designed to scale, so you keep these benefits even as you run hundreds of experiments.

### Update the Conda environment file

The `train.py` script just took a new dependency on `azureml.core`. Update `pytorch-env.yml` to reflect this change:

```yml
name: pytorch-env
channels:
    - defaults
    - pytorch
dependencies:
    - python=3.7
    - pytorch
    - torchvision
    - pip
    - pip:
        - azureml-sdk
```

Make sure you save this file before you submit the run.

### Submit the run to Azure Machine Learning

Select the tab for the *run-pytorch.py* script, then select **Save and run script in terminal** to rerun the *run-pytorch.py* script. Make sure you save your changes to `pytorch-env.yml` first.

This time when you visit the studio, go to the **Metrics** tab where you can now see live updates on the model training loss! It may take a 1 to 2  minutes before the training begins.

## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue now to another tutorial, or to start your own training jobs, skip to [Related resources](#related-resources).

### Stop compute instance

If you're not going to use it now, stop the compute instance:

1. In the studio, on the left, select **Compute**.
1. In the top tabs, select **Compute instances**
1. Select the compute instance in the list.
1. On the top toolbar, select **Stop**.


### Delete all resources

[!INCLUDE [aml-delete-resource-group](../includes/aml-delete-resource-group.md)]

You can also keep the resource group but delete a single workspace. Display the workspace properties and select **Delete**.

## Related resources

In this session, you upgraded from a basic "Hello world!" script to a more realistic training script that required a specific Python environment to run. You saw how to use curated Azure Machine Learning environments. Finally, you saw how in a few lines of code you can log metrics to Azure Machine Learning.

There are other ways to create Azure Machine Learning environments, including [from a pip requirements.txt](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.environment.environment#from-pip-requirements-name--file-path-) file or [from an existing local Conda environment](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.environment.environment#from-existing-conda-environment-name--conda-environment-name-).
