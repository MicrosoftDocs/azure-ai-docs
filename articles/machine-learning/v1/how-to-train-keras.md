# Train Keras models at scale with Azure Machine Learning (SDK v1)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v1](../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [v1 deprecation](../includes/sdk-v1-deprecation.md)]

In this article, learn how to run your Keras training scripts with Azure Machine Learning.

The example code in this article shows you how to train and register a Keras classification model built using the TensorFlow backend with Azure Machine Learning. It uses the popular [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to classify handwritten digits using a deep neural network (DNN) built using the [Keras Python library](https://keras.io) running on top of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview).

Keras is a high-level neural network API capable of running top of other popular DNN frameworks to simplify development. With Azure Machine Learning, you can rapidly scale out training jobs using elastic cloud compute resources. You can also track your training runs, version models, deploy models, and much more.

Whether you're developing a Keras model from the ground-up or you're bringing an existing model into the cloud, Azure Machine Learning can help you build production-ready models.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the Keras API **tf.keras** built into TensorFlow and not the standalone Keras package, refer instead to [Train TensorFlow models](how-to-train-tensorflow.md).

## Prerequisites

Run this code on either of these environments:

- Azure Machine Learning compute instance - no downloads or installation necessary

     - Complete the [Quickstart: Get started with Azure Machine Learning](../quickstart-create-resources.md) to create a dedicated notebook server pre-loaded with the SDK and the sample repository.
    - In the samples folder on the notebook server, find a completed and expanded notebook by navigating to this directory: **how-to-use-azureml > ml-frameworks > keras > train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-keras** folder.

 - Your own Jupyter Notebook server

    - [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install) (>= 1.15.0).
    - [Create a workspace configuration file](how-to-configure-environment.md).
    - [Download the sample script files](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/ml-frameworks/keras/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-keras) `keras_mnist.py` and `utils.py`

    You can also find a completed [Jupyter Notebook version](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/ml-frameworks/keras/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-keras/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-keras.ipynb) of this guide on the GitHub samples page. The notebook includes expanded sections covering intelligent hyperparameter tuning, model deployment, and notebook widgets.

## Set up the experiment

This section sets up the training experiment by loading the required Python packages, initializing a workspace, creating the FileDataset for the input training data, creating the compute target, and defining the training environment.

### Import packages

First, import the necessary Python libraries.

```Python
import os
import azureml
from azureml.core import Experiment
from azureml.core import Environment
from azureml.core import Workspace, Run
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute
from azureml.core.compute_target import ComputeTargetException
```

### Initialize a workspace

The [Azure Machine Learning workspace](../concept-workspace.md) is the top-level resource for the service. It provides you with a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create. In the Python SDK, you can access the workspace artifacts by creating a [`workspace`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace.workspace) object.

Create a workspace object from the `config.json` file created in the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

```Python
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

### Create a file dataset

A `FileDataset` object references one or multiple files in your workspace datastore or public urls. The files can be of any format, and the class provides you with the ability to download or mount the files to your compute. By creating a `FileDataset`, you create a reference to the data source location. If you applied any transformations to the data set, they will be stored in the data set as well. The data remains in its existing location, so no extra storage cost is incurred. See the [how-to](how-to-create-register-datasets.md) guide on the `Dataset` package for more information.

```python
from azureml.core.dataset import Dataset

web_paths = [
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz'
            ]
dataset = Dataset.File.from_files(path=web_paths)
```

You can use the `register()` method to register the data set to your workspace so they can be shared with others, reused across various experiments, and referred to by name in your training script.

```python
dataset = dataset.register(workspace=ws,
                           name='mnist-dataset',
                           description='training and test dataset',
                           create_new_version=True)
```

### Create a compute target

Create a compute target for your training job to run on. In this example, create a GPU-enabled Azure Machine Learning compute cluster.

[!INCLUDE [gpu quota](../includes/machine-learning-gpu-quota.md)]

```Python
cluster_name = "gpu-cluster"

try:
    compute_target = ComputeTarget(workspace=ws, name=cluster_name)
    print('Found existing compute target')
except ComputeTargetException:
    print('Creating a new compute target...')
    compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size='STANDARD_NC6',
                                                           max_nodes=4)

    compute_target = ComputeTarget.create(ws, cluster_name, compute_config)

    compute_target.wait_for_completion(show_output=True, min_node_count=None, timeout_in_minutes=20)
```

For more information on compute targets, see the [what is a compute target](../concept-compute-target.md) article.

### Define your environment

Define the Azure Machine Learning [Environment](../concept-environments.md) that encapsulates your training script's dependencies.

First, define your conda dependencies in a YAML file; in this example the file is named `conda_dependencies.yml`.

```yaml
channels:
- conda-forge
dependencies:
- python=3.7
- pip:
  - azureml-defaults
  - tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0
  - keras<=2.3.1
  - matplotlib
```

Create an Azure Machine Learning environment from this conda environment specification. The environment will be packaged into a Docker container at runtime.

By default if no base image is specified, Azure Machine Learning will use a CPU image `azureml.core.environment.DEFAULT_CPU_IMAGE` as the base image. Since this example runs training on a GPU cluster, you will need to specify a GPU base image that has the necessary GPU drivers and dependencies. Azure Machine Learning maintains a set of base images published on Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) that you can use, see the [Azure/AzureML-Containers](https://github.com/Azure/AzureML-Containers) GitHub repo for more information.

```python
keras_env = Environment.from_conda_specification(name='keras-env', file_path='conda_dependencies.yml')

# Specify a GPU base image
keras_env.docker.enabled = True
keras_env.docker.base_image = 'mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-cuda10.0-cudnn7-ubuntu18.04'
```

For more information on creating and using environments, see [Create and use software environments in Azure Machine Learning](how-to-use-environments.md).

## Configure and submit your training run

### Create a ScriptRunConfig
First get the data from the workspace datastore using the `Dataset` class.

```python
dataset = Dataset.get_by_name(ws, 'mnist-dataset')

# list the files referenced by mnist-dataset
dataset.to_path()
```

Create a ScriptRunConfig object to specify the configuration details of your training job, including your training script, environment to use, and the compute target to run on.

Any arguments to your training script will be passed via command line if specified in the `arguments` parameter. The DatasetConsumptionConfig for our FileDataset is passed as an argument to the training script, for the `--data-folder` argument. Azure Machine Learning will resolve this DatasetConsumptionConfig to the mount-point of the backing datastore, which can then be accessed from the training script.

```python
from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig

args = ['--data-folder', dataset.as_mount(),
        '--batch-size', 50,
        '--first-layer-neurons', 300,
        '--second-layer-neurons', 100,
        '--learning-rate', 0.001]

src = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory=script_folder,
                      script='keras_mnist.py',
                      arguments=args,
                      compute_target=compute_target,
                      environment=keras_env)
```

For more information on configuring jobs with ScriptRunConfig, see [Configure and submit training runs](how-to-set-up-training-targets.md).

> [!WARNING]
> If you were previously using the TensorFlow estimator to configure your Keras training jobs, please note that Estimators have been deprecated as of the 1.19.0 SDK release. With Azure Machine Learning SDK >= 1.15.0, ScriptRunConfig is the recommended way to configure training jobs, including those using deep learning frameworks. For common migration questions, see the [Estimator to ScriptRunConfig migration guide](how-to-migrate-from-estimators-to-scriptrunconfig.md).

### Submit your run

The [Run object](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.run%28class%29) provides the interface to the run history while the job is running and after it has completed.

```Python
run = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='Tutorial-Keras-Minst').submit(src)
run.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
```

### What happens during run execution
As the run is executed, it goes through the following stages:

- **Preparing**: A docker image is created according to the environment defined. The image is uploaded to the workspace's container registry and cached for later runs. Logs are also streamed to the run history and can be viewed to monitor progress. If a curated environment is specified instead, the cached image backing that curated environment will be used.

- **Scaling**: The cluster attempts to scale up if the Batch AI cluster requires more nodes to execute the run than are currently available.

- **Running**: All scripts in the script folder are uploaded to the compute target, data stores are mounted or copied, and the `script` is executed. Outputs from stdout and the **./logs** folder are streamed to the run history and can be used to monitor the run.

- **Post-Processing**: The **./outputs** folder of the run is copied over to the run history.

## Register the model

Once you've trained the model, you can register it to your workspace. Model registration lets you store and version your models in your workspace to simplify [model management and deployment](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md).

```Python
model = run.register_model(model_name='keras-mnist', model_path='outputs/model')
```

> [!TIP]
> The deployment how-to
contains a section on registering models, but you can skip directly to [creating a compute target](how-to-deploy-and-where.md#choose-a-compute-target) for deployment, since you already have a registered model.

You can also download a local copy of the model. This can be useful for doing additional model validation work locally. In the training script, `keras_mnist.py`, a TensorFlow saver object persists the model to a local folder (local to the compute target). You can use the Run object to download a copy from the run history.

```Python
# Create a model folder in the current directory
os.makedirs('./model', exist_ok=True)

for f in run.get_file_names():
    if f.startswith('outputs/model'):
        output_file_path = os.path.join('./model', f.split('/')[-1])
        print('Downloading from {} to {} ...'.format(f, output_file_path))
        run.download_file(name=f, output_file_path=output_file_path)
```
