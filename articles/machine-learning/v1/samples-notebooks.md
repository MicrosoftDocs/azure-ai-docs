# Explore Azure Machine Learning with Jupyter Notebooks (v1)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v1](../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [v1 deprecation](../includes/sdk-v1-deprecation.md)]

The [Azure Machine Learning Notebooks repository](https://github.com/azure/machinelearningnotebooks) includes Azure Machine Learning Python SDK (v1) samples. These Jupyter notebooks are designed to help you explore the SDK and serve as models for your own machine learning projects.  In this repository, you'll find tutorial notebooks in the **tutorials** folder and feature-specific notebooks in the **how-to-use-azureml** folder.

This article shows you how to access the repositories from the following environments:

- Azure Machine Learning compute instance
- Bring your own notebook server
- Data Science Virtual Machine


## Option 1: Access on Azure Machine Learning compute instance (recommended)

The easiest way to get started with the samples is to complete [Create resources you need to get started](../quickstart-create-resources.md). Once completed, you'll have a dedicated notebook server pre-loaded with the SDK and the Azure Machine Learning Notebooks repository. No downloads or installation necessary.  

To view example notebooks:
    1. Sign in to [studio](https://ml.azure.com) and select your workspace if necessary.
    1. Select **Notebooks**.
    1. Select the **Samples** tab. Use the **SDK v1** folder for examples using Python SDK v1.

## Option 2: Access on your own notebook server

If you'd like to bring your own notebook server for local development, follow these steps on your computer.

[!INCLUDE [aml-your-server](../includes/aml-your-server.md)]

These instructions install the base SDK packages necessary for the quickstart and tutorial notebooks. Other sample notebooks may require you to install extra components. For more information, see [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install).

## Option 3: Access on a DSVM

The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is a customized VM image built specifically for doing data science. If you [create a DSVM](how-to-configure-environment.md), the SDK and notebook server are installed and configured for you. However, you'll still need to create a workspace and clone the sample repository.

1. [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md).

1. Add a workspace configuration file using either of these methods:

    * In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), select your workspace settings in the upper right, then select **Download config file**. 

    ![Screenshot of download config.json.](../media/aml-dsvm-server/download-config.png)

    * Create a new workspace using code in the [configuration.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/configuration.ipynb) notebook.

1. From the directory where you added the configuration file, clone [the Machine Learning Notebooks repository](https://aka.ms/aml-notebooks).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks.git --depth 1
    ```

1. Start the notebook server from the directory, which now contains the clone and the config file.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
