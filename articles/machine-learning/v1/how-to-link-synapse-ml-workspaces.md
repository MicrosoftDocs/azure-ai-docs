# Link Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Machine Learning workspaces and attach Apache Spark pools(deprecated)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v1](../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [v1 deprecation](../includes/sdk-v1-deprecation.md)]

> [!WARNING]
> The Azure Synapse Analytics integration with Azure Machine Learning, available in Python SDK v1, is deprecated. Users can still use Synapse workspace, registered with Azure Machine Learning, as a linked service. However, a new Synapse workspace can no longer be registered with Azure Machine Learning as a linked service. We recommend use of serverless Spark compute and attached Synapse Spark pools, available in CLI v2 and Python SDK v2. For more information, visit [https://aka.ms/aml-spark](https://aka.ms/aml-spark).

In this article, you learn how to create a linked service that links your [Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-what-is) workspace and [Azure Machine Learning workspace](../concept-workspace.md).

With an Azure Machine Learning workspace, linked with an Azure Synapse workspace, you can attach an Apache Spark pool, powered by Azure Synapse Analytics, as a dedicated compute resource. You can use this resource for data wrangling at scale, or you can conduct model training - all from the same Python notebook.

You can link your ML workspace and Synapse workspace with the [Python SDK](#link-workspaces-with-the-python-sdk) or the [Azure Machine Learning studio](#link-workspaces-via-studio). You can also link workspaces, and attach a Synapse Spark pool, with a single [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/machine-learning-linkedservice-create/azuredeploy.json).

## Prerequisites

* [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](../quickstart-create-resources.md)

* Install the [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro)

* [Create a Synapse workspace in Azure portal](/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-workspace)

* [Create an Apache Spark pool using Azure portal, web tools, or Synapse Studio](/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool-studio)

* Access to the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/)

## Link workspaces with the Python SDK

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To successfully link to the Synapse workspace, you must be granted the **Owner** role of the Synapse workspace. Check your access in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
>
> If you're only a **Contributor** to the Synapse workspace, and you don't have an **Owner** for that Synapse workspace, you can only use existing linked services. For more information, visit [Retrieve and use an existing linked service](#get-an-existing-linked-service).

This code employs the [`LinkedService`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.linked_service.linkedservice) and [`SynapseWorkspaceLinkedServiceConfiguration`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.linked_service.synapseworkspacelinkedserviceconfiguration) classes, to

* Link your machine learning workspace `ws` with your Azure Synapse workspace
* Register your Synapse workspace with Azure Machine Learning as a linked service

``` python
import datetime  
from azureml.core import Workspace, LinkedService, SynapseWorkspaceLinkedServiceConfiguration

# Azure Machine Learning workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()

#link configuration 
synapse_link_config = SynapseWorkspaceLinkedServiceConfiguration(
    subscription_id=ws.subscription_id,
    resource_group= 'your resource group',
    name='mySynapseWorkspaceName')

# Link workspaces and register Synapse workspace in Azure Machine Learning
linked_service = LinkedService.register(workspace = ws,              
                                            name = 'synapselink1',    
                                            linked_service_config = synapse_link_config)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Managed identity `system_assigned_identity_principal_id` is created for each linked service. You must grant this managed identity the **Synapse Apache Spark Administrator** role of the Synapse workspace before you start your Synapse session. For more information, visit [How to manage Azure Synapse RBAC assignments in Synapse Studio](/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-manage-synapse-rbac-role-assignments).
>
> To find the `system_assigned_identity_principal_id` of a specific linked service, use `LinkedService.get('<your-mlworkspace-name>', '<linked-service-name>')`.

### Manage linked services

View all the linked services associated with your machine learning workspace:

```python
LinkedService.list(ws)
```

To unlink your workspaces, use the `unregister()` method:

``` python
linked_service.unregister()
```

## Link workspaces via studio

Link your machine learning workspace and Synapse workspace via the Azure Machine Learning studio:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/)
1. Select **Linked Services** in the **Manage** section of the left pane
1. Select **Add integration**
1. On the **Link workspace** form, populate the fields

    |Field| Description    
    |---|---
    |Name| Provide a name for your linked service. References to this specific linked service use this name
    |Subscription name | Select the name of your subscription associated with your machine learning workspace
    |Synapse workspace | Select the Synapse workspace to which you want to link
    
1. Select **Next** to open the **Select Spark pools (optional)** form. On this form, you select which Synapse Spark pool to attach to your workspace

1. Select **Next** to open the **Review** form, and check your selections
1. Select **Create** to complete the linked service creation process

## Get an existing linked service

Before you can attach a dedicated compute for data wrangling, you must have a machine learning workspace linked to an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. We refer to this workspace as a linked service. Retrieval and use of an existing linked service requires **User or Contributor** permissions to the **Azure Synapse Analytics workspace**.

This example retrieves an existing linked service - `synapselink1` - from the workspace `ws`, with the [`get()`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.linkedservice#azureml-core-linkservice-get) method:

```python
from azureml.core import LinkedService

linked_service = LinkedService.get(ws, 'synapselink1')
```

## Attach Synapse Spark pool as a compute

Once you retrieve the linked service, attach a Synapse Apache Spark pool as a dedicated compute resource for your data wrangling tasks. You can attach Apache Spark pools with

* Azure Machine Learning studio
* [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/machine-learning-linkedservice-create/azuredeploy.json)
* The Azure Machine Learning Python SDK

### Attach a pool via the studio

1. Sign in to the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/)
1. Select **Linked Services** in the **Manage** section of the left pane
1. Select your Synapse workspace
1. Select **Attached Spark pools** on the top left
1. Select **Attach**
1. Select your Apache Spark pool from the list and provide a name
    1. This list identifies the available Synapse Spark pools that can be attached to your compute
    1. To create a new Synapse Spark pool, see [Quickstart: Create a new serverless Apache Spark pool using the Azure portal](/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool-portal)
1. Select **Attach selected**

### Attach a pool with the Python SDK

You can also employ the **Python SDK** to attach an Apache Spark pool, as shown in this code example:

```python
from azureml.core.compute import SynapseCompute, ComputeTarget

attach_config = SynapseCompute.attach_configuration(linked_service, #Linked synapse workspace alias
                                                    type='SynapseSpark', #Type of assets to attach
                                                    pool_name=synapse_spark_pool_name) #Name of Synapse spark pool 

synapse_compute = ComputeTarget.attach(workspace= ws,                
                                       name= synapse_compute_name, 
                                       attach_configuration= attach_config
                                      )

synapse_compute.wait_for_completion()
```

Verify the Apache Spark pool is attached.

```python
ws.compute_targets['Synapse Spark pool alias']
```

This code

1. Configures the [`SynapseCompute`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.synapsecompute) with

   1. The [`LinkedService`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.linkedservice), `linked_service` that you either created or retrieved in the previous step
   1. The type of compute target you want to attach - in this case, `SynapseSpark`
   1. The name of the Apache Spark pool. The name must match an existing Apache Spark pool that exists in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace
   
1. Creates a machine learning [`ComputeTarget`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.computetarget) by passing in
   1. The machine learning workspace you want to use, `ws`
   1. The name you'd like to use to refer to the compute within the Azure Machine Learning workspace
   1. The attach_configuration you specified when you configured your Synapse Compute
       1. The call to ComputeTarget.attach() is asynchronous, so the sample execution is blocked until the call completes
