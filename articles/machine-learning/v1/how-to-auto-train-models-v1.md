# Train regression model with Automated ML and Python (SDK v1)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v1](../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [v1 deprecation](../includes/sdk-v1-deprecation.md)]

In this article, you learn how to train a regression model with the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK by using Azure Machine Learning Automated ML. The regression model predicts passenger fares for taxi cabs operating in New York City (NYC). You write code with the Python SDK to configure a workspace with prepared data, train the model locally with custom parameters, and explore the results.

The process accepts training data and configuration settings. It automatically iterates through combinations of different feature normalization/standardization methods, models, and hyperparameter settings to arrive at the best model. The following diagram illustrates the process flow for the regression model training:

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. You can create a [free or paid account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) of Azure Machine Learning.

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace or compute instance. To prepare these resources, see [Quickstart: Get started with Azure Machine Learning](../quickstart-create-resources.md).

- Get the prepared sample data for the tutorial exercises by loading a notebook into your workspace:

   1. Go to your workspace in the Azure Machine Learning studio, select **Notebooks**, and then select the **Samples** tab.

   1. In the list of notebooks, expand the **Samples** > **SDK v1** > **tutorials** > **regression-automl-nyc-taxi-data** node.
   
   1. Select the _regression-automated-ml.ipynb_ notebook.

   1. To run each notebook cell as part of this tutorial, select **Clone this file**.

   **Alternate approach**: If you prefer, you can run the tutorial exercises in a [local environment](how-to-configure-environment.md). The tutorial is available in the [Azure Machine Learning Notebooks repository](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/tutorials) on GitHub. For this approach, follow these steps to get the required packages:
   
   1. [Install the full `automl` client](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/v1-archive/v1/python-sdk/tutorials/automl-with-azureml/README.md#setup-using-a-local-conda-environment).
      
   1. Run the `pip install azureml-opendatasets azureml-widgets` command on your local machine to get the required packages.

## Download and prepare data

The Open Datasets package contains a class that represents each data source (such as `NycTlcGreen`) to easily filter date parameters before downloading.

The following code imports the necessary packages: 

```python
from azureml.opendatasets import NycTlcGreen
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
```

The first step is to create a dataframe for the taxi data. When you work in a non-Spark environment, the Open Datasets package allows downloading only one month of data at a time with certain classes. This approach helps to avoid the `MemoryError` issue that can occur with large datasets.

To download the taxi data, iteratively fetch one month at a time. Before you append the next set of data to the `green_taxi_df` dataframe, randomly sample 2,000 records from each month, and then preview the data. This approach helps to avoid bloating the dataframe.

The following code creates the dataframe, fetches the data, and loads it into the dataframe:

```python
green_taxi_df = pd.DataFrame([])
start = datetime.strptime("1/1/2015","%m/%d/%Y")
end = datetime.strptime("1/31/2015","%m/%d/%Y")

for sample_month in range(12):
   temp_df_green = NycTlcGreen(start + relativedelta(months=sample_month), end + relativedelta(months=sample_month)) \
      .to_pandas_dataframe()
   green_taxi_df = green_taxi_df.append(temp_df_green.sample(2000))

green_taxi_df.head(10)
```

The following table shows the many columns of values in the sample taxi data:

| vendorID | lpepPickupDatetime | lpepDropoffDatetime | passengerCount | tripDistance | puLocationId | doLocationId | pickupLongitude | pickupLatitude | dropoffLongitude |...| paymentType | fareAmount | extra | mtaTax | improvementSurcharge | tipAmount | tollsAmount | ehailFee | totalAmount | tripType |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

It's helpful to remove some columns that you don't need for training or other feature building. For example, you might remove the **lpepPickupDatetime** column because Automated ML automatically handles time-based features.

The following code removes 14 columns from the sample data:

```python
columns_to_remove = ["lpepDropoffDatetime", "puLocationId", "doLocationId", "extra", "mtaTax",
                "improvementSurcharge", "tollsAmount", "ehailFee", "tripType", "rateCodeID",
                "storeAndFwdFlag", "paymentType", "fareAmount", "tipAmount"
               ]
for col in columns_to_remove:
   green_taxi_df.pop(col)

green_taxi_df.head(5)
```

### Cleanse data

The next step is to cleanse the data.

The following code runs the `describe()` function on the new dataframe to produce summary statistics for each field:

```python
green_taxi_df.describe()
```

The following table shows summary statistics for the remaining fields in the sample data:
	
| | vendorID | passengerCount | tripDistance | pickupLongitude | pickupLatitude | dropoffLongitude | dropoffLatitude | totalAmount |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **count**	| 24000.00 | 24000.00 | 24000.00 | 24000.00   | 24000.00  | 24000.00   | 24000.00  | 24000.00  |
| **mean**	| 1.777625 | 1.373625 | 2.893981 | -73.827403 | 40.689730 | -73.819670 | 40.684436 | 14.892744 | 
| **std**	| 0.415850 | 1.046180 | 3.072343 | 2.821767   | 1.556082  | 2.901199   | 1.599776  | 12.339749 | 
| **min**	| 1.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     | -74.357101 | 0.00      | -74.342766 | 0.00      | -120.80   | 
| **25%**	| 2.00     | 1.00     | 1.05     | -73.959175 | 40.699127 | -73.966476 | 40.699459 | 8.00      | 
| **50%**	| 2.00     | 1.00     | 1.93     | -73.945049 | 40.746754 | -73.944221 | 40.747536 | 11.30     | 
| **75%**	| 2.00     | 1.00     | 3.70     | -73.917089 | 40.803060 | -73.909061 | 40.791526 | 17.80     | 
| **max**	| 2.00     | 8.00     | 154.28   | 0.00       | 41.109089 | 0.00       | 40.982826 | 425.00    | 

The summary statistics reveal several fields that are outliers, which are values that reduce model accuracy. To address this issue, filter the latitude/longitude (lat/long) fields so the values are within the bounds of the Manhattan area. This approach filters out longer taxi trips or trips that are outliers in respect to their relationship with other features.

Next, filter the `tripDistance` field for values that are greater than zero but less than 31 miles (the haversine distance between the two lat/long pairs). This technique eliminates long outlier trips that have inconsistent trip cost.

Lastly, the `totalAmount` field has negative values for the taxi fares, which don't make sense in the context of the model. The `passengerCount` field also contains bad data where the minimum value is zero.

The following code filters out these value anomalies by using query functions. The code then removes the last few columns that aren't necessary for training:

```python
final_df = green_taxi_df.query("pickupLatitude>=40.53 and pickupLatitude<=40.88")
final_df = final_df.query("pickupLongitude>=-74.09 and pickupLongitude<=-73.72")
final_df = final_df.query("tripDistance>=0.25 and tripDistance<31")
final_df = final_df.query("passengerCount>0 and totalAmount>0")

columns_to_remove_for_training = ["pickupLongitude", "pickupLatitude", "dropoffLongitude", "dropoffLatitude"]
for col in columns_to_remove_for_training:
   final_df.pop(col)
```

The last step in this sequence is to call the `describe()` function again on the data to ensure cleansing worked as expected. You now have a prepared and cleansed set of taxi, holiday, and weather data to use for machine learning model training:

```python
final_df.describe()
```

## Configure workspace

Create a workspace object from the existing workspace. A [Workspace](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace.workspace) is a class that accepts your Azure subscription and resource information. It also creates a cloud resource to monitor and track your model runs.

The following code calls the `Workspace.from_config()` function to read the _config.json_ file and load the authentication details into an object named `ws`. 

```python
from azureml.core.workspace import Workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

The `ws` object is used throughout the rest of the code in this tutorial.

## Split data into train and test sets

Split the data into training and test sets by using the `train_test_split` function in the _scikit-learn_ library. This function segregates the data into the x (**features**) data set for model training and the y (**values to predict**) data set for testing.

The `test_size` parameter determines the percentage of data to allocate to testing. The `random_state` parameter sets a seed to the random generator, so that your train-test splits are deterministic.

The following code calls the `train_test_split` function to load the x and y datasets:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

x_train, x_test = train_test_split(final_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=223)
```

The purpose of this step is to prepare data points to test the finished model that aren't used to train the model. These points are used to measure true accuracy. A well-trained model is one that can make accurate predictions from unseen data. You now have data prepared for autotraining a machine learning model.

## Automatically train model

To automatically train a model, take the following steps:

1. Define settings for the experiment run. Attach your training data to the configuration, and modify settings that control the training process.

1. Submit the experiment for model tuning. After you submit the experiment, the process iterates through different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings, adhering to your defined constraints. It chooses the best-fit model by optimizing an accuracy metric.

### Define training settings

Define the experiment parameter and model settings for training. View the full list of [settings](how-to-configure-auto-train.md). Submitting the experiment with these default settings takes approximately 5-20 minutes. To decrease the run time, reduce the `experiment_timeout_hours` parameter.

| Property | Value in this tutorial | Description |
|----|----|---|
| `iteration_timeout_minutes` | 10                   | Time limit in minutes for each iteration. Increase this value for larger datasets that need more time for each iteration. |
| `experiment_timeout_hours`  | 0.3                  | Maximum amount of time in hours that all iterations combined can take before the experiment terminates. |
| `enable_early_stopping`     | True                 | Flag to enable early termination if the score isn't improving in the short term. |
| `primary_metric`            | spearman_correlation | Metric that you want to optimize. The best-fit model is chosen based on this metric. |
| `featurization`             | auto                 | The _auto_ value allows the experiment to preprocess the input data, including handling missing data, converting text to numeric, and so on. |
| `verbosity`                 | logging.INFO         | Controls the level of logging. |
| `n_cross_validations`       | 5                    | Number of cross-validation splits to perform when validation data isn't specified. |

The following code submits the experiment:

```python
import logging

automl_settings = {
   "iteration_timeout_minutes": 10,
   "experiment_timeout_hours": 0.3,
   "enable_early_stopping": True,
   "primary_metric": 'spearman_correlation',
   "featurization": 'auto',
   "verbosity": logging.INFO,
   "n_cross_validations": 5
}
```

The following code lets you use your defined training settings as a `**kwargs` parameter to an `AutoMLConfig` object. Additionally, you specify your training data and the type of model, which is `regression` in this case.

```python
from azureml.train.automl import AutoMLConfig

automl_config = AutoMLConfig(task='regression',
                      debug_log='automated_ml_errors.log',
                      training_data=x_train,
                      label_column_name="totalAmount",
                      **automl_settings)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Automated ML pre-processing steps (feature normalization, handling missing data, converting text to numeric, and so on) become part of the underlying model. When you use the model for predictions, the same pre-processing steps applied during training are applied to your input data automatically.

### Train automatic regression model

Create an experiment object in your workspace. An experiment acts as a container for your individual jobs. Pass the defined `automl_config` object to the experiment, and set the output to _True_ to view progress during the job.

After you start the experiment, the displayed output updates live as the experiment runs. For each iteration, you see the model type, run duration, and training accuracy. The field `BEST` tracks the best running training score based on your metric type:

```python
from azureml.core.experiment import Experiment
experiment = Experiment(ws, "Tutorial-NYCTaxi")
local_run = experiment.submit(automl_config, show_output=True)
```

Here's the output:

## Explore results

Explore the results of automatic training with a [Jupyter widget](/python/api/azureml-widgets/azureml.widgets). The widget allows you to see a graph and table of all individual job iterations, along with training accuracy metrics and metadata. Additionally, you can filter on different accuracy metrics than your primary metric with the dropdown selector.

The following code produces a graph to explore the results:

```python
from azureml.widgets import RunDetails
RunDetails(local_run).show()
```

The run details for the Jupyter widget:

### Retrieve best model

The following code lets you select the best model from your iterations. The `get_output` function returns the best run and the fitted model for the last fit invocation. By using the overloads on the `get_output` function, you can retrieve the best run and fitted model for any logged metric or a particular iteration.

```python
best_run, fitted_model = local_run.get_output()
print(best_run)
print(fitted_model)
```

### Test best model accuracy

Use the best model to run predictions on the test data set to predict taxi fares. The `predict` function uses the best model and predicts the values of y, **trip cost**, from the `x_test` data set. 

The following code prints the first 10 predicted cost values from the `y_predict` data set:

```python
y_test = x_test.pop("totalAmount")

y_predict = fitted_model.predict(x_test)
print(y_predict[:10])
```

Calculate the `root mean squared error` of the results. Convert the `y_test` dataframe to a list and compare with the predicted values. The `mean_squared_error` function takes two arrays of values and calculates the average squared error between them. Taking the square root of the result gives an error in the same units as the y variable, **cost**. It indicates roughly how far the taxi fare predictions are from the actual fares.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from math import sqrt

y_actual = y_test.values.flatten().tolist()
rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_actual, y_predict))
rmse
```

Run the following code to calculate mean absolute percent error (MAPE) by using the full `y_actual` and `y_predict` data sets. This metric calculates an absolute difference between each predicted and actual value and sums all the differences. Then it expresses that sum as a percent of the total of the actual values.

```python
sum_actuals = sum_errors = 0

for actual_val, predict_val in zip(y_actual, y_predict):
   abs_error = actual_val - predict_val
   if abs_error < 0:
      abs_error = abs_error * -1

   sum_errors = sum_errors + abs_error
   sum_actuals = sum_actuals + actual_val

mean_abs_percent_error = sum_errors / sum_actuals
print("Model MAPE:")
print(mean_abs_percent_error)
print()
print("Model Accuracy:")
print(1 - mean_abs_percent_error)
```

Here's the output:

```output
Model MAPE:
0.14353867606052823

Model Accuracy:
0.8564613239394718
```

From the two prediction accuracy metrics, you see that the model is fairly good at predicting taxi fares from the data set's features, typically within +- $4.00, and approximately 15% error.

The traditional machine learning model development process is highly resource-intensive. It requires significant domain knowledge and time investment to run and compare the results of dozens of models. Using automated machine learning is a great way to rapidly test many different models for your scenario.

## Clean up resources

If you don't plan to work on other Azure Machine Learning tutorials, complete the following steps to remove the resources you no longer need.

### Stop compute

If you used a compute, you can stop the virtual machine when you aren't using it and reduce your costs:

1. Go to your workspace in the Azure Machine Learning studio, and select **Compute**.

1. In the list, select the compute you want to stop, and then select **Stop**.

When you're ready to use the compute again, you can restart the virtual machine.

### Delete other resources

If you don't plan to use the resources you created in this tutorial, you can delete them and avoid incurring further charges.

Follow these steps to remove the resource group and all resources:

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Resource groups**.

1. In the list, select the resource group you created in this tutorial, and then select **Delete resource group**.

1. At the confirmation prompt, enter the resource group name, and then select **Delete**.

If you want to keep the resource group, and delete a single workspace only, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to the resource group that contains the workspace you want to remove.

1. Select the workspace, select **Properties**, and then select **Delete**.
