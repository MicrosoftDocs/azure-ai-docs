### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.37.0
+ **Breaking changes**
  + **azureml-core**
    + Starting in version 1.37.0, Azure Machine Learning SDK uses MSAL as the underlying authentication library. MSAL uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) v2.0 authentication flow to provide more functionality and increases security for token cache. For more information, see [Overview of the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview).
    + Update AML SDK dependencies to the latest version of Azure Resource Management Client Library for Python (azure-mgmt-resource>=15.0.0,<20.0.0) & adopt track2 SDK.
    + Starting in version 1.37.0, azure-ml-cli extension should be compatible with the latest version of Azure CLI >=2.30.0.
    + When using Azure CLI in a pipeline, like as Azure DevOps, ensure all tasks/stages are using versions of Azure CLI above v2.30.0 for MSAL-based Azure CLI. Azure CLI 2.30.0 is not backward compatible with prior versions and throws an error when using incompatible versions. To use Azure CLI credentials with Azure Machine Learning SDK, Azure CLI should be installed as pip package.

  + **azureml-core**
    + Added functionality to filter Tabular Datasets by column values and File Datasets by metadata.
    + Previously, it was possibly for users to create provisioning configurations for ComputeTarget's that didn't satisfy the password strength requirements for the `admin_user_password` field (that is, that they must contain at least 3 of the following: One lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character from the following set: ``\`~!@#$%^&*()=+_[]{}|;:./'",<>?``). If the user created a configuration with a weak password and ran a job using that configuration, the job would fail at runtime. Now, the call to `AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration` throws a `ComputeTargetException` with an accompanying error message explaining the password strength requirements.
    + Additionally, it was also possible in some cases to specify a configuration with a negative number of maximum nodes. It's no longer possible to do this. Now, `AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration` throws a `ComputeTargetException` if the `max_nodes` argument is a negative integer.
    + With setting show_output to True when deploy models, inference configuration and deployment configuration is displayed.
    + With setting show_output to True when wait for the completion of model deployment, the progress of deployment operation is displayed.
    + Allow customer specified Azure Machine Learning auth config directory through environment variable: AZUREML_AUTH_CONFIG_DIR
    + Previously, it was possible to create a provisioning configuration with the minimum node count less than the maximum node count. The job would run but fail at runtime. This bug has now been fixed. If you now try to create a provisioning configuration with `min_nodes < max_nodes` the SDK raises a `ComputeTargetException`.
  + **azureml-interpret**
    + fix explanation dashboard not showing aggregate feature importances for sparse engineered explanations
    + optimized memory usage of ExplanationClient in azureml-interpret package
  + **azureml-train-automl-client**
    +  Fixed show_output=False to return control to the user when running using spark.

    + [Experimental feature] Add support to attach synapse spark pool into AML as a compute
    + [Experimental feature] Add support for identity based data access. Users can register datastore or datasets without providing credentials. In such case, users' Azure AD token or managed identity of compute target is used for authentication. To learn more, see [Connect to storage by using identity-based data access](./how-to-identity-based-data-access.md).
  + **azureml-pipeline-steps**
    + [Experimental feature] Add support for [SynapseSparkStep](/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.synapsesparkstep)
  + **azureml-synapse**
    + [Experimental feature] Add support of spark magic to run interactive session in synapse spark pool.
+ **Bug fixes and improvements**
  + **azureml-automl-runtime**
    + In this update, we added holt winters exponential smoothing to forecasting toolbox of AutoML SDK. Given a time series, the best model is selected by [AICc (Corrected Akaike's Information Criterion)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/selecting-predictors.html#selecting-predictors) and returned.
    + AutoML now generates two log files instead of one. Log statements go to one or the other depending on which process the log statement was generated in.
    + Remove unnecessary in-sample prediction during model training with cross-validations. This may decrease model training time in some cases, especially for time-series forecasting models.
  + **azureml-contrib-fairness**
    + Add a JSON schema for the dashboardDictionary uploads.
  + **azureml-contrib-interpret**
    + azureml-contrib-interpret README is updated to reflect that package will be removed in next update after being deprecated since October, use azureml-interpret package instead
  + **azureml-core**
    + Previously, it was possible to create a provisioning configuration with the minimum node count less than the maximum node count. This has now been fixed. If you now try to create a provisioning configuration with `min_nodes < max_nodes` the SDK will raise a `ComputeTargetException`.
    +  Fixes bug in wait_for_completion in AmlCompute, which caused the function to return control flow before the operation was actually complete
    + Run.fail() is now deprecated, use Run.tag() to mark run as failed or use Run.cancel() to mark the run as canceled.
    + Show error message 'Environment name expected str, {} found' when provided environment name isn't a string.
  + **azureml-train-automl-client**
    + Fixed a bug that prevented AutoML experiments performed on Azure Databricks clusters from being canceled.

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.22.0
+ **Bug fixes and improvements**
  + **azureml-automl-core**
    + Fixed bug where an extra pip dependency was added to the conda yml file for vision models.
  + **azureml-automl-runtime**
    + Fixed a bug where classical forecasting models (for example, AutoArima) could receive training data wherein rows with imputed target values weren't present. This violated the data contract of these models. * Fixed various bugs with lag-by-occurrence behavior in the time-series lagging operator. Previously, the lag-by-occurrence operation didn't mark all imputed rows correctly and so wouldn't always generate the correct occurrence lag values. Also fixed some compatibility issues between the lag operator and the rolling window operator with lag-by-occurrence behavior. This previously resulted in the rolling window operator dropping some rows from the training data that it should otherwise use.
  + **azureml-core**
    + Adding support for Token Authentication by audience.
    + Add `process_count` to [PyTorchConfiguration](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.runconfig.pytorchconfiguration) to support multi-process multi-node PyTorch jobs.
  + **azureml-pipeline-steps**
    + [CommandStep](/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.commandstep) now GA and no longer experimental.
    + [ParallelRunConfig](/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.parallelrunconfig): add argument allowed_failed_count and allowed_failed_percent to check error threshold on mini batch level. Error threshold has three flavors now:
       + error_threshold - the number of allowed failed mini batch items;
       + allowed_failed_count - the number of allowed failed mini batches;
       + allowed_failed_percent- the percent of allowed failed mini batches.

       A job stops if it exceeds any of them. error_threshold is required to keep it backward compatibility. Set the value to -1 to ignore it.
    + Fixed whitespace handling in AutoMLStep name.
    + ScriptRunConfig is now supported by HyperDriveStep
  + **azureml-train-core**
    + HyperDrive runs invoked from a ScriptRun is now considered a child run.
    + Add `process_count` to [PyTorchConfiguration](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.runconfig.pytorchconfiguration) to support multi-process multi-node PyTorch jobs.
  + **azureml-widgets**
    + Add widget ParallelRunStepDetails to visualize status of a ParallelRunStep.
    + Allows hyperdrive users to see an axis on the parallel coordinates chart that shows the metric value corresponding to each set of hyperparameters for each child run.

+ **New features**
  + **azureml-automl-runtime**
    + AutoML Forecasting now supports customers forecast beyond the prespecified max-horizon without retraining the model. When the forecast destination is farther into the future than the specified maximum horizon, the forecast() function still makes point predictions out to the later date using a recursive operation mode. For the illustration of the new feature, see the "Forecasting farther than the maximum horizon" section of "forecasting-forecast-function" notebook in [folder](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning)."

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.4.0

+ **New features**
  + AmlCompute clusters now support setting up a managed identity on the cluster at the time of provisioning. Just specify whether you would like to use a system-assigned identity or a user-assigned identity, and pass an identityId for the latter. You can then set up permissions to access various resources like Storage or ACR in a way that the identity of the compute gets used to securely access the data, instead of a token-based approach that AmlCompute employs today. Check out our SDK reference for more information on the parameters.


+ **Breaking changes**
  + AmlCompute clusters supported a Preview feature around run-based creation, that we are planning on deprecating in two weeks. You can continue to create persistent compute targets as always by using the Amlcompute class, but the specific approach of specifying the identifier "amlcompute" as the compute target in run config will not be supported soon.

+ **Bug fixes and improvements**
  + **azureml-automl-runtime**
    + Enable support for unhashable type when calculating number of unique values in a column.
  + **azureml-core**
    + Improved stability when reading from Azure Blob Storage using a TabularDataset.
    + Improved documentation for the `grant_workspace_msi` parameter for `Datastore.register_azure_blob_store`.
    + Fixed bug with `datastore.upload` to support the `src_dir` argument ending with a `/` or `\`.
    + Added actionable error message when trying to upload to an Azure Blob Storage datastore that does not have an access key or SAS token.
  + **azureml-interpret**
    + Added upper bound to file size for the visualization data on uploaded explanations.
  + **azureml-train-automl-client**
    + Explicitly checking for label_column_name & weight_column_name parameters for AutoMLConfig to be of type string.
  + **azureml-contrib-pipeline-steps**
    + ParallelRunStep now supports dataset as pipeline parameter. User can construct pipeline with sample dataset and can change input dataset of the same type (file or tabular) for new pipeline run.

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.3.0

+ **Bug fixes and improvements**
  + **azureml-automl-core**
    + Added more telemetry around post-training operations.
    + Speeds up automatic ARIMA training by using conditional sum of squares (CSS) training for series of length longer than 100. The length used is stored as the constant ARIMA_TRIGGER_CSS_TRAINING_LENGTH w/in the TimeSeriesInternal class at /src/azureml-automl-core/azureml/automl/core/shared/constants.py
    + The user logging of forecasting runs was improved, now more information on what phase is currently running is shown in the log
    + Disallowed target_rolling_window_size to be set to values less than 2
  + **azureml-automl-runtime**
    + Improved the error message shown when duplicated timestamps are found.
    + Disallowed target_rolling_window_size to be set to values less than 2.
    + Fixed the lag imputation failure. The issue was caused by the insufficient number of observations needed to seasonally decompose a series. The "de-seasonalized" data is used to compute a partial autocorrelation function (PACF) to determine the lag length.
    + Enabled column purpose featurization customization for forecasting tasks by featurization config. Numerical and Categorical as column purpose for forecasting tasks is now supported.
    + Enabled drop column featurization customization for forecasting tasks by featurization config.
    + Enabled imputation customization for forecasting tasks by featurization config. Constant value imputation for target column and mean, median, most_frequent, and constant value imputation for training data are now supported.
  + **azureml-contrib-pipeline-steps**
    + Accept string compute names to be passed to ParallelRunConfig
  + **azureml-core**
    +  Added Environment.clone(new_name) API to create a copy of Environment object
    +  Environment.docker.base_dockerfile accepts filepath. If able to resolve a file, the content is read into base_dockerfile environment property
    + Automatically reset mutually exclusive values for base_image and base_dockerfile when user manually sets a value in Environment.docker
    + Added user_managed flag in RSection that indicates whether the environment is managed by user or by Azure Machine Learning.
    + Dataset: Fixed dataset download failure if data path containing unicode characters.
    + Dataset: Improved dataset mount caching mechanism to respect the minimum disk space requirement in Azure Machine Learning Compute, which avoids making the node unusable and causing the job to be canceled.
    + Dataset: We add an index for the time series column when you access a time series dataset as a pandas dataframe, which is used to speed up access to time series-based data access.  Previously, the index was given the same name as the timestamp column, confusing users about which is the actual timestamp column and which is the index. We now don't give any specific name to the index since it should not be used as a column.
    + Dataset: Fixed dataset authentication issue in sovereign cloud.
    + Dataset: Fixed `Dataset.to_spark_dataframe` failure for datasets created from Azure PostgreSQL datastores.
  + **azureml-interpret**

  + **azureml-train-automl-runtime**
    + Added more telemetry around post-training operations.
    + added sparse AutoML end to end support
  + **azureml-opendatasets**
    + Added another telemetry for service monitor.
    + Enable front door for blob to increase stability

Reading data this way is faster and more optimized for parallel execution on multiple CPU cores. However, it may result in silently producing more records with misaligned field values. This should be set to `True` when the delimited files are known to contain quoted line breaks.
    + Added the ability to register ADLS Gen2 in the Azure Machine Learning CLI
    + Renamed parameter 'fine_grain_timestamp' to 'timestamp' and parameter 'coarse_grain_timestamp' to 'partition_timestamp' for the with_timestamp_columns() method in TabularDataset to better reflect the usage of the parameters.
    + Increased max experiment name length to 255.
  + **azureml-interpret**

### Web experience

The collaborative workspace landing page at [https://ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com) has been enhanced and rebranded as the Azure Machine Learning studio.

From the studio, you can train, test, deploy, and manage Azure Machine Learning assets such as datasets, pipelines, models, endpoints, and more.

Access the following web-based authoring tools from the studio:

| Web-based tool | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Notebook VM(preview) | Fully managed cloud-based workstation |
| [Automated machine learning](../tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md) (preview) | No code experience for automating machine learning model development |
| [Designer](concept-designer.md) | Drag-and-drop machine learning modeling tool formerly known as the visual interface |


### Azure Machine Learning designer enhancements

+ Formerly known as the visual interface
+    11 new [modules](../component-reference/component-reference.md) including recommenders, classifiers, and training utilities including feature engineering, cross validation, and data transformation.

### R SDK

Data scientists and AI developers use the [Azure Machine Learning SDK for R](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-sdk-for-r) to build and run machine learning workflows with Azure Machine Learning.

The Azure Machine Learning SDK for R uses the `reticulate` package to bind to the Python SDK. By binding directly to Python, the SDK for R allows you access to core objects and methods implemented in the Python SDK from any R environment you choose.

Main capabilities of the SDK include:

+    Manage cloud resources for monitoring, logging, and organizing your machine learning experiments.
+    Train models using cloud resources, including GPU-accelerated model training.
+    Deploy your models as webservices on Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

See the [package website](https://azure.github.io/azureml-sdk-for-r) for complete documentation.

### Azure Machine Learning integration with Event Grid

Azure Machine Learning is now a resource provider for Event Grid, you can configure machine learning events through the Azure portal or Azure CLI. Users can create events for run completion, model registration, model deployment, and data drift detected. These events can be routed to event handlers supported by Event Grid for consumption. See machine learning event [schema](/azure/event-grid/event-schema-machine-learning) and [tutorial](../how-to-use-event-grid.md) articles for more details.

### New web experience (preview) for Azure Machine Learning workspaces
The new web experience enables data scientists and data engineers to complete their end-to-end machine learning lifecycle from prepping and visualizing data to training and deploying models in a single location.

![Azure Machine Learning workspace UI (preview)](../media/azure-machine-learning-release-notes/new-ui-for-workspaces.jpg)

**Key features:**

Using this new Azure Machine Learning interface, you can now:
+ Manage your notebooks or link out to Jupyter
+ [Run automated ML experiments](../tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md)
+ [Create datasets from local files, datastores, & web files](how-to-create-register-datasets.md)
+ Explore & prepare datasets for model creation
+ Monitor data drift for your models
+ View recent resources from a dashboard

At the time, of this release, the following browsers are supported: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge Preview.

**Known issues:**

1. Refresh your browser if you see "Something went wrong! Error loading chunk files" when deployment is in progress.

1. Can't delete or rename file in Notebooks and Files. During Public Preview, you can use Jupyter UI or Terminal in Notebook VM to perform update file operations. Because it is a mounted network file system all changes, you make on Notebook VM are immediately reflected in the Notebook Workspace.

1. To SSH into the Notebook VM:
   1. Find the SSH keys that were created during VM setup. Or, find the keys in the Azure Machine Learning workspace > open Compute tab > locate Notebook VM in the list > open its properties: copy the keys from the dialog.
   1. Import those public and private SSH keys to your local machine.
   1. Use them to SSH into the Notebook VM.

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.0.60

+ **New features**
  + Introduced FileDataset, which references single or multiple files in your datastores or public urls. The files can be of any format. FileDataset provides you with the ability to download or mount the files to your compute.
  + Added Pipeline Yaml Support for PythonScript Step, Adla Step, Databricks Step, DataTransferStep, and AzureBatch Step

+ **Bug fixes and improvements**
  + **azureml-automl-core**
    + AutoArima is now a suggestable pipeline for preview only.
    + Improved error reporting for forecasting.
    + Improved the logging by using custom exceptions instead of generic in the forecasting tasks.
    + Removed the check on max_concurrent_iterations to be less than total number of iterations.
    + AutoML models now return AutoMLExceptions
    + This release improves the execution performance of automated machine learning local runs.
  + **azureml-core**
    + Introduce Dataset.get_all(workspace), which returns a dictionary of `TabularDataset` and `FileDataset` objects keyed by their registration name.

    ```python
    workspace = Workspace.from_config()
    all_datasets = Dataset.get_all(workspace)
    mydata = all_datasets['my-data']
    ```

    + Introduce `parition_format` as argument to `Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files` and `Dataset.Tabular.from_parquet.files`. The partition information of each data path is extracted into columns based on the specified format. '{column_name}' creates string column, and '{column_name:yyyy/MM/dd/HH/mm/ss}' creates datetime column, where 'yyyy', 'MM', 'dd', 'HH', 'mm' and 'ss' are used to extract year, month, day, hour, minute, and second for the datetime type. The partition_format should start from the position of first partition key until the end of file path. For example, given the path '../USA/2019/01/01/data.csv' where the partition is by country/region and time, partition_format='/{Country}/{PartitionDate:yyyy/MM/dd}/data.csv' creates string column 'Country' with value 'USA' and datetime column 'PartitionDate' with value '2019-01-01'.
        ```python
        workspace = Workspace.from_config()
        all_datasets = Dataset.get_all(workspace)
        mydata = all_datasets['my-data']
        ```

    + Introduce `partition_format` as argument to `Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files` and `Dataset.Tabular.from_parquet.files`. The partition information of each data path is extracted into columns based on the specified format. '{column_name}' creates string column, and '{column_name:yyyy/MM/dd/HH/mm/ss}' creates datetime column, where 'yyyy', 'MM', 'dd', 'HH', 'mm' and 'ss' are used to extract year, month, day, hour, minute, and second for the datetime type. The partition_format should start from the position of first partition key until the end of file path.

    + `to_csv_files` and `to_parquet_files` methods have been added to `TabularDataset`. These methods enable conversion between a `TabularDataset` and a `FileDataset` by converting the data to files of the specified format.
    + Automatically log into the base image registry when saving a Dockerfile generated by Model.package().
    + 'gpu_support' is no longer necessary; AML now automatically detects and uses the nvidia docker extension when it is available. It will be removed in a future release.
    + Added support to create, update, and use PipelineDrafts.
    + This release improves the execution performance of automated machine learning local runs.
    + Users can query metrics from run history by name.
    + Improved the logging by using custom exceptions instead of generic in the forecasting tasks.
  + **azureml-explain-model**
    + Added feature_maps parameter to the new MimicWrapper, allowing users to get raw feature explanations.

    + Add `get_token()` method to `Webservice` objects.
    + Added CLI support to manage machine learning datasets.
    + `Datastore.register_azure_blob_container` now optionally takes a `blob_cache_timeout` value (in seconds) which configures blobfuse's mount parameters to enable cache expiration for this datastore. The default is no timeout, such as when a blob is read, it stays in the local cache until the job is finished. Most jobs  prefer this setting, but some jobs need to read more data from a large dataset than will fit on their nodes. For these jobs, tuning this parameter helps them succeed. Take care when tuning this parameter: setting the value too low can result in poor performance, as the data used in an epoch may expire before being used again. All reads are done from blob storage/network rather than the local cache, which negatively impacts training times.
    + Model description can now properly be updated after registration
    + Model and Image deletion now provides more information about upstream objects that depend on them, which causes the delete to fail

## 2019-04-26

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.0.33 released.

+ Azure Machine Learning Hardware Accelerated Models on [FPGAs](how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service.md) is generally available.
  + You can now [use the azureml-accel-models package](how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service.md) to:
    + Train the weights of a supported deep neural network (ResNet 50, ResNet 152, DenseNet-121, VGG-16, and SSD-VGG)
    + Use transfer learning with the supported DNN
    + Register the model with Model Management Service and containerize the model
    + Deploy the model to an Azure VM with an FPGA in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster
  + Deploy the container to an [Azure Stack Edge](/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-overview) server device
  + Score your data with the gRPC endpoint with this [sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aml-hardware-accelerated-models)

### Automated Machine Learning

+ Feature sweeping to enable dynamically adding :::no-loc text="featurizers"::: for performance optimization. New :::no-loc text="featurizers":::: work embeddings, weight of evidence, target encodings, text target encoding, cluster distance
+ Smart CV to handle train/valid splits inside automated ML
+ Few memory optimization changes and runtime performance improvement
+ Performance improvement in model explanation
+ ONNX model conversion for local run
+ Added Subsampling support
+ Intelligent Stopping when no exit criteria defined
+ Stacked ensembles

+ Time Series Forecasting
  + New predict forecast function
  + You can now use rolling-origin cross validation on time series data
  + New functionality added to configure time series lags
  + New functionality added to support rolling window aggregate features
  + New Holiday detection and featurizer when country/region code is defined in experiment settings

+ Azure Databricks
  + Enabled time series forecasting and model explainabilty/interpretability capability
  + You can now cancel and resume (continue) automated ML experiments
  + Added support for multicore processing

### MLOps
+ **Local deployment & debugging for scoring containers**<br/> You can now deploy an ML model locally and iterate quickly on your scoring file and  dependencies to ensure they behave as expected.

+ **Introduced InferenceConfig & Model.deploy()**<br/> Model deployment now supports specifying a source folder with an entry script, the same as a RunConfig.  Additionally, model deployment has been simplified to a single command.

+ **Git reference tracking**<br/> Customers have been requesting basic Git integration capabilities for some time as it helps maintain a complete audit trail. We have implemented tracking across major entities in Azure Machine Learning for Git-related metadata (repo, commit, clean state). This information will be collected automatically by the SDK and CLI.

+ **Model profiling & validation service**<br/> Customers frequently complain of the difficulty to properly size the compute associated with their inference service. With our model profiling service, the customer can provide sample inputs and we profile across 16 different CPU / memory configurations to determine optimal sizing for deployment.

+ **Bring your own base image for inference**<br/> Another common complaint was the difficulty in moving from experimentation to inference RE sharing dependencies. With our new base image sharing capability, you can now reuse your experimentation base images, dependencies and all, for inference. This should speed up deployments and reduce the gap from the inner to the outer loop.

+ **Improved Swagger schema generation experience**<br/> Our previous swagger generation method was error prone and impossible to automate. We have a new in-line way of generating swagger schemas from any Python function via decorators. We have open-sourced this code and our schema generation protocol is not coupled to the Azure Machine Learning platform.

+ **Azure Machine Learning CLI is generally available (GA)**<br/> Models can now be deployed with a single CLI command. We got common customer feedback that no one deploys an ML model from a Jupyter notebook. The [**CLI reference documentation**](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md) has been updated.

   + With this release, you can set up a user account on your managed compute cluster (amlcompute), while creating it. This can be done by passing these properties in the provisioning configuration. You can find more details in the [SDK reference documentation](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.amlcompute.amlcompute#provisioning-configuration-vm-size-----vm-priority--dedicated---min-nodes-0--max-nodes-none--idle-seconds-before-scaledown-none--admin-username-none--admin-user-password-none--admin-user-ssh-key-none--vnet-resourcegroup-name-none--vnet-name-none--subnet-name-none--tags-none--description-none--remote-login-port-public-access--notspecified--).

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.0.17

+ **New features**
  + Azure Machine Learning now provides first class support for popular DNN framework Chainer. Using [`Chainer`](/python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.dnn.chainer) class users can easily train and deploy Chainer models.
    + Learn how to [run hyperparameter tuning with Chainer using HyperDrive](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/b881f78e4658b4e102a72b78dbd2129c24506980/how-to-use-azureml/ml-frameworks/chainer/deployment/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-chainer/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-chainer.ipynb)
  + Azure Machine Learning Pipelines added ability to trigger a Pipeline run based on datastore modifications. The pipeline [schedule notebook](https://aka.ms/pl-schedule) is updated to showcase this feature.

+ **Bug fixes and improvements**
  + We have added support in Azure Machine Learning pipelines for setting the source_directory_data_store property to a desired datastore (such as a blob storage) on [RunConfigurations](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.runconfig.runconfiguration) that are supplied to the [PythonScriptStep](/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.python_script_step.pythonscriptstep). By default Steps use Azure File store as the backing datastore, which may run into throttling issues when a large number of steps are executed concurrently.

### Azure portal

+ **New features**
  + New drag and drop table editor experience for reports. Users can drag a column from the well to the table area where a preview of the table will be displayed. The columns can be rearranged.
  + New Logs file viewer
  + Links to experiment runs, compute, models, images, and deployments from the activities tab
