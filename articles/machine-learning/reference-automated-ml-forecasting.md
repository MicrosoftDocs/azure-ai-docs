The early stopping window starts only after first 20 iterations. | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `max_concurrent_trials` | integer | The maximum number of trials (children jobs) that would be executed in parallel. It's highly recommended to set the number of concurrent runs to the number of nodes in the cluster (aml compute defined in `compute`). | | `1` |
| `max_trials` | integer | Represents the maximum number of trials an Automated ML job can try to run a training algorithm with different combination of hyperparameters. Its default value is set to 1000. If `enable_early_termination` is defined, then the number of trials used to run training algorithms can be smaller.| | `1000` |

This timeout includes setup, featurization, training runs, ensembling and model explainability (if provided) of all trials. <br> Note that it doesn't include the ensembling and model explainability runs at the end of the process if the job fails to get completed within provided `timeout_minutes` since these features are available once all the trials (children jobs) are done. <br> Its default value is set to 360 minutes (6 hours). To specify a timeout less than or equal to 1 hour (60 minutes), the user should make sure dataset's size isn't greater than 10,000,000 (rows times column) or an error results. | | `360` |
| `trial_timeout_minutes ` | integer | The maximum amount of time in minutes that each trial (child job) in the submitted Automated ML job can take run. After the specified amount of time, the child job will get terminated. | |`30`|

| `time_column_name` | string | **Required** <br>The name of the column in the dataset that corresponds to the time axis of each time series. The input dataset for training, validation or test must contain this column if the task is `forecasting`. If not provided or set to `None`, Automated ML forecasting job throws an error and terminate the experiment. | | |
| `forecast_horizon` | string or integer | The maximum forecast horizon in units of time-series frequency. These units are based on the inferred time interval of your training data, (Ex: monthly, weekly) that the forecaster uses to predict.

| `frequency` | string | The frequency at which the forecast generation is desired, for example daily, weekly, yearly, etc. <br>If it isn't specified or set to None, then its default value is inferred from the dataset time index. The user can set its value greater than dataset's inferred frequency, but not less than it. For example, if dataset's frequency is daily, it can take values like daily, weekly, monthly, but not hourly as hourly is less than daily(24 hours).<br> Refer to [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#dateoffset-objects) for more information.|  | `None` |
| `time_series_id_column_names` | string or list(strings) | The names of columns in the data to be used to group data into multiple time series. If time_series_id_column_names is not defined or set to None, the Automated ML uses auto-detection logic to detect the columns.|  | `None` |
| `feature_lags` | string | Represents if user wants to generate lags automatically for the provided numeric features. The default is set to `auto`, meaning that Automated ML uses autocorrelation-based heuristics to automatically select lag orders and generate corresponding lag features for all numeric features.

These characters should be represented in ISO 3166 two-letter country/region codes, for example 'US' or 'GB'.

For example, if it is set to 3 for daily data, the origin time for each fold is three days apart. If it set to None or not specified, then it's set to `auto` by default. If it is of integer type, minimum value it can take is 1 else it raises an error. | `auto`, [int] | `auto` |
| `seasonality` | string or integer | The time series seasonality as an integer multiple of the series frequency. If seasonality is not specified, its value is set to `'auto'`, meaning it is inferred automatically by Automated ML. If this parameter is not set to `None`, the Automated ML assumes time series as non-seasonal, which is equivalent to setting it as integer value 1. | `'auto'`, [int] | `auto` | 
| `short_series_handling_config` | string | Represents how Automated ML should handle short time series if specified. It takes following values: <br><ul><li>`'auto'` : short series is padded if there are no long series, otherwise short series is dropped.</li><li>`'pad'`: all the short series is padded with zeros.</li><li>`'drop'`: all the short series is dropped.</li><li> `None`: the short series is not modified.</li><ul>| `'auto'`, `'pad'`, `'drop'`, `None` | `auto` |
| `target_aggregate_function` | string | Represents the aggregate function to be used to aggregate the target column in time series and generate the forecasts at specified frequency (defined in `freq`).

| `target_lags` | string or integer or list(integer) | The number of past/historical periods to use to lag from the target values based on the dataset frequency. By default, this parameter is turned off. The `'auto'` setting allows system to use automatic heuristic based lag. <br>This lag property should be used when the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable do not correlate by default. For more information, see [Lagged features for time series forecasting in Automated ML](./concept-automl-forecasting-lags.md).| `'auto'`, [int] | `None` |
| `target_rolling_window_size` | string or integer | The number of past observations to use for creating a rolling window average of the target column.

Specify this parameter when you only want to consider a certain amount of history when training the model. | `'auto'`, integer, `None` | `None` |
| `use_stl` | string | The components to generate by applying STL decomposition on time series.If not provided or set to None, no time series component is generated.<br>use_stl can take two values: <br>`'season'` : to generate season component. <br>`'season_trend'` : to generate both season Automated ML and trend components. | `'season'`, `'seasontrend'` | `None` |
