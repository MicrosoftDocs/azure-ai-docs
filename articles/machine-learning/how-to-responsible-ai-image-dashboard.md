# Use the responsible AI image dashboard (preview)

[Responsible AI (RAI) dashboards](how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard.md) include visualizations and functionality to help you analyze your machine learning model and make data-driven business decisions. The steps to view and configure RAI dashboards are similar across scenarios, but some features are unique to image scenarios. This article describes how to access and configure RAI image dashboard components and functionality.

Responsible AI image dashboards are linked to your registered computer vision models in Azure Machine Learning. The [Responsible AI Vision Insights component](how-to-responsible-ai-vision-insights.md) supports image classification and object detection scenarios.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Responsible AI image dashboard is currently in public preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and isn't recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- A registered machine learning model that has a responsible AI image dashboard created with a running compute resource connected.

  You can create a Responsible AI image dashboard by using:

  - [The Azure Machine Learning studio UI](how-to-responsible-ai-insights-ui.md)
  - [YAML and Python via a pipeline job](how-to-responsible-ai-insights-sdk-cli.md)

  Some features of the RAI image dashboard require dynamic, on-the-fly, and real-time computation. For complete functionality of the image scenarios, you need to connect a running compute resource to your dashboard.

  - For object detection, setting an Intersection over Union (IOU) threshold is disabled by default, and is enabled only if a compute resource is attached.
  - When you submit a Distributed Parallel Version 2 (DPv2) job, attaching a compute resource enables precomputing of all model explanations instead of loading explanations on-demand.

  For more information, see [Enable full functionality of the Responsible AI dashboard](how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard.md#enable-full-functionality-of-the-responsible-ai-dashboard).

- To open the Responsible AI image dashboard in Machine Learning studio, select your registered model in the **Models** list, select **Responsible AI** at the top of the model page, and then select the name of your Responsible AI image dashboard from the list.

## Cohorts

In the RAI image dashboard, you can select or create data *cohorts*, which are subsets of data created by manually adding filters or saving selected data. You can view, create, edit, duplicate, and delete cohorts.

The default dashboard view shows the **Global cohort**, which is all of the data. At the top of the dashboard, you can select **Switch cohort** to select a different cohort or **New cohort** to create a new cohort. You can also select the **Settings** icon to open a side panel that lists the names and details of all cohorts, and lets you switch or create new cohorts.

## RAI image dashboard components

The following sections describe the Responsible AI image dashboard components. Available components and functionality differ between image classification and object detection scenarios.

# [Image classification](#tab/classification)

For image classification and multilabel classification models, the Responsible AI image dashboard includes **Error analysis**, **Vision data explorer**, **Model overview**, and **Data analysis** components.

### Error analysis

**Error analysis** tools are available for image classification and multiclassification tasks. These tools accelerate detection of fairness errors and identify under/overrepresentation in your dataset.

Instead of passing in tabular data, you can run error analysis on specified image metadata features by including the metadata as added columns in your `mltable` dataset. To learn more about error analysis, see [Assess errors in machine learning models](concept-error-analysis.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/error-analysis.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an error analysis tree that shows the mean pixel value." lightbox="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/error-analysis.png":::

# [Object detection](#tab/detection)

For object detection, the Responsible AI image dashboard includes **Vision data explorer**, **Model overview**, and **Data analysis** components. The **Error analysis** dashboard component isn't available for object detection tasks. To learn more about error analysis, see [Assess errors in machine learning models](concept-error-analysis.md).

# [Object detection](#tab/detection)

For object detection, incorrect predictions can refer to:

- Incorrectly labeling at least one object.
- Incorrectly detecting an object class when a ground truth object doesn't exist.
- Failing to detect an object class when a ground truth object exists.

Each image card displays the image and how many object predictions were **Correct** or **Wrong** for that image.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/image-explorer-object.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image explorer for object detection." lightbox="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/image-explorer-object.png":::

Selecting an image card opens a flyout to view components that support the analysis of model predictions.

### Model overview

The model overview component provides a comprehensive set of performance metrics for evaluating your computer vision model, along with key performance disparity metrics across dataset cohorts. You can choose between **Dataset cohorts** or **Feature cohorts** views by selecting either tab at the top of the component.

#### Dataset cohorts view

The **Dataset cohorts** view displays the selected metrics across the global cohort and all user-defined cohorts in the dashboard.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/dataset-cohorts-top.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Dataset cohorts view." lightbox="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/dataset-cohorts-top.png":::

Select **Metric(s)** from the dropdown list, or select **Help me choose metrics** to open a sidebar screen that explains, recommends, and lets you select metrics to display. You can adjust which metrics to view by using the multiselect dropdown list to select and deselect performance metrics.

You can also choose to **Show heatmap** for the displayed data.

>[!NOTE]
>Performance metrics display **N/A** at their initial state and while metrics computations are loading.

# [Image classification](#tab/classification)

Recommended metrics for image classification and image multilabel classification include **Accuracy score**, **Macro Precision score**, **Macro Recall score**, and **Macro F1 score**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/dataset-cohorts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of model overview on the dataset cohorts pane." lightbox="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/dataset-cohorts.png":::

# [Object detection](#tab/detection)

Recommended metrics for object detection include **Mean Average Precision score**, **Average Precision score**, and **Average Recall score**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/dataset-cohorts-object.png" alt-text="Screenshot of vision data explorer showing successful instances of object detection." lightbox="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-vision-insights/dataset-cohorts-object.png":::

For object detection, in addition to selecting the **Metric(s)**, configure the following settings:

- **Aggregate method**: Select which aggregation method to apply, which affects the calculation of mean average precision.
- **Select class(es)**: Select which class label to use to calculate class-level metrics like average precision and average recall.
- **IoU Threshold**: Set an IOU threshold value for the Intersection over Union between the ground truth and prediction bounding box. The IOU threshold value defines error and affects calculation of model performance metrics.
  For example, setting an IOU of greater than 70% means that a prediction with greater than 70% overlap with ground truth is `True`. This feature is disabled by default, and can be enabled by attaching a running compute instance.

## Model interpretability

For AutoML image classification models, four kinds of explainability methods are supported:

- [Guided backprop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806)
- [Guided gradCAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391v4)
- [Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365)
- [XRAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02825)

The explanations are generated only for the predicted class. For multilabel classification, a threshold on confidence score is required to select the classes to generate explanations for. See the [parameter list](how-to-responsible-ai-vision-insights.md#responsible-ai-vision-insights-component-parameter-automl-specific) for the parameter name.

These four methods are specific to AutoML image classification only, and don't work with other task types such as object detection and instance segmentation. Non-AutoML image classification models can use SHAP vision for model interpretability. Both AutoML and non-AutoML object detection models can use [D-RISE](https://github.com/microsoft/vision-explanation-methods) to generate visual explanations for model predictions.

To learn more about the four explainability methods, see [Generate explanations for predictions](how-to-auto-train-image-models.md#generate-explanations-for-predictions). For more information about vision model interpretability techniques and how to interpret visual explanations of model behavior, see [Model interpretability](how-to-machine-learning-interpretability.md).
