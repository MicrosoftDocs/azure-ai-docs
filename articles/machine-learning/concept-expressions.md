# Expressions in Azure Machine Learning SDK and CLI v2

With Azure Machine Learning SDK and CLI v2, you can use _expressions_ when a value may not be known when you're authoring a job or component. When you submit a job or call a component, the expression is evaluated and the value is substituted.

The format for an expression is `${{ <expression> }}`. Some expressions are evaluated on the _client_, when submitting the job or component. Other expressions are evaluated on the _server_ (the compute where the job or component is running.)

## Client expressions

> [!NOTE]
> The "client" that evaluates the expression is where the job is submitted or component is ran. For example, your local machine or a compute instance.

| Expression | Description | Scope |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `${{inputs.<input_name>}}` | References to an input data asset or model. | Works for all jobs. |
| `${{outputs.<output_name>}}` | References to an output data asset or model. | Works for all jobs. |
| `${{search_space.<hyperparameter>}}` | References the hyperparameters to use in a sweep job. The hyperparameter values for each trial are selected based on the `search_space`. | Sweep jobs only. |
| `${{parent.inputs.<input_name>}}` | Binds the inputs of a child job (pipeline step) in a pipeline to the inputs of the top-level parent pipeline job. | Pipeline jobs only. |
| `${{parent.outputs.<output_name>}}` | Binds the outputs of a child job (pipeline step) in a pipeline to the outputs of the top-level parent pipeline job. | Pipeline jobs only. |
| `${{parent.jobs.<step-name>.inputs.<input-name>}}` | Binds to the inputs of another step in the pipeline. | Pipeline jobs only. |
| `${{parent.jobs.<step-name>.outputs.<output-name>}}` | Binds to the outputs of another step in the pipeline. | Pipeline jobs only. |
