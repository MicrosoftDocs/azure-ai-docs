# Deploy Azure Machine Learning extension on AKS or Arc Kubernetes cluster

To enable your AKS or Arc Kubernetes cluster to run training jobs or inference workloads, you must first deploy the Azure Machine Learning extension on an AKS or Arc Kubernetes cluster. The Azure Machine Learning extension is built on the [cluster extension for AKS](/azure/aks/cluster-extensions) and [cluster extension or Arc Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/conceptual-extensions), and its lifecycle can be managed easily with Azure CLI [k8s-extension](/cli/azure/k8s-extension).

In this article, you can learn:

> * Review Azure Machine Learning extension components
> * Manage Azure Machine Learning extension

## Prerequisites

* An AKS cluster running in Azure. If you haven't previously used cluster extensions, you need to [register the KubernetesConfiguration service provider](/azure/aks/dapr#register-the-kubernetesconfiguration-resource-provider).
* Or an Arc Kubernetes cluster is up and running. Follow instructions in [connect existing Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster).
  * If the cluster is an Azure RedHat OpenShift (ARO) Service cluster or OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster, you must satisfy other prerequisite steps as documented in the [Reference for configuring Kubernetes cluster](./reference-kubernetes.md#prerequisites-for-aro-or-ocp-clusters) article.
* For production purposes, the Kubernetes cluster must have a minimum of **4 vCPU cores and 14-GB memory**. For more information on resource detail and cluster size recommendations, see [Recommended resource planning](./reference-kubernetes.md).
* Cluster running behind an **outbound proxy server** or **firewall** needs extra [network configurations](./how-to-access-azureml-behind-firewall.md#scenario-use-kubernetes-compute).
* Install or upgrade Azure CLI to version 2.24.0 or higher.
* Install or upgrade Azure CLI extension `k8s-extension` to version 1.2.3 or higher.
  

## Limitations

- [Using a service principal with AKS](/azure/aks/kubernetes-service-principal) is **not supported** by Azure Machine Learning. The AKS cluster must use a **managed identity** instead. Both **system-assigned managed identity** and **user-assigned managed identity** are supported. For more information, see [Use a managed identity in Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/use-managed-identity).
    -  When your AKS cluster used service principal is converted to use Managed Identity, before installing the extension, all node pools need to be deleted and recreated, rather than updated directly.
- [Disabling local accounts](/azure/aks/manage-local-accounts-managed-azure-ad#disable-local-accounts) for AKS is **not supported**  by Azure Machine Learning. When the AKS Cluster is deployed, local accounts are enabled by default.
- If your AKS cluster has an [Authorized IP range enabled to access the API server](/azure/aks/api-server-authorized-ip-ranges), enable the Azure Machine Learning control plane IP ranges for the AKS cluster. The Azure Machine Learning control plane is deployed across paired regions. Without access to the API server, the machine learning pods can't be deployed. Use the [IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=56519) for both the [paired regions](/azure/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure) when enabling the IP ranges in an AKS cluster.
- Azure Machine Learning doesn't support attaching an AKS cluster cross subscription. If you have an AKS cluster in a different subscription, you must first [connect it to Azure-Arc](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster) and specify in the same subscription as your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- Azure Machine Learning doesn't guarantee support for all preview stage features in AKS. For example, [Microsoft Entra pod identity](/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity) isn't supported.
- If you've followed the steps from [Azure Machine Learning AKS v1 document](./v1/how-to-create-attach-kubernetes.md?view=azureml-api-1&preserve-view=true) to create or attach your AKS as inference cluster, use the following link to [clean up the legacy azureml-fe related resources](./v1/how-to-create-attach-kubernetes.md?view=azureml-api-1&preserve-view=true#delete-azureml-fe-related-resources) before you continue the next step.


## Review Azure Machine Learning extension configuration settings

You can use Azure Machine Learning CLI command `k8s-extension create` to deploy Azure Machine Learning extension. CLI `k8s-extension create` allows you to specify a set of configuration settings in `key=value` format using `--config` or `--config-protected` parameter. Following is the list of available configuration settings to be specified during Azure Machine Learning extension deployment.

|Configuration Setting Key Name  |Description  |Training |Inference |Training and Inference
   |--|--|--|--|--|
   |`enableTraining` |`True` or `False`, default `False`. **Must** be set to `True` for Azure Machine Learning extension deployment with Machine Learning model training and batch scoring support.  |  **&check;**| N/A |  **&check;** |
   | `enableInference` |`True` or `False`, default `False`.  **Must** be set to `True` for Azure Machine Learning extension deployment with Machine Learning inference support. |N/A| **&check;** |  **&check;** |
   | `allowInsecureConnections` |`True` or `False`, default `False`. **Can** be set to `True` to use inference HTTP endpoints for development or test purposes. |N/A| Optional |  Optional |
   | `inferenceRouterServiceType` |`loadBalancer`, `nodePort` or `clusterIP`.  **Required** if `enableInference=True`. | N/A| **&check;** |   **&check;** |
   | `internalLoadBalancerProvider` | This config is only applicable for Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) cluster now. Set to `azure` to allow the inference router using internal load balancer.  | N/A| Optional |  Optional |
   |`sslSecret`| The name of the Kubernetes secret in the `azureml` namespace. This config is used to store `cert.pem` (PEM-encoded TLS/SSL cert) and `key.pem` (PEM-encoded TLS/SSL key), which are required for inference HTTPS endpoint support when ``allowInsecureConnections`` is set to `False`. For a sample YAML definition of `sslSecret`, see [Configure sslSecret](./how-to-secure-kubernetes-online-endpoint.md). Use this config or a combination of `sslCertPemFile` and `sslKeyPemFile` protected config settings. |N/A| Optional |  Optional |
   |`sslCname` |An TLS/SSL CNAME is used by inference HTTPS endpoint. **Required** if `allowInsecureConnections=False`  |  N/A | Optional | Optional|
   | `inferenceRouterHA` |`True` or `False`, default `True`. By default, Azure Machine Learning extension deploys three inference router replicas for high availability, which requires at least three worker nodes in a cluster. Set to `False` if your cluster has fewer than three worker nodes, in this case only one inference router service is deployed. | N/A| Optional |  Optional |
   |`nodeSelector` | By default, the deployed kubernetes resources and your machine learning workloads are randomly deployed to one or more nodes of the cluster, and DaemonSet resources are deployed to ALL nodes. If you want to restrict the extension deployment and your training/inference workloads to specific nodes with label `key1=value1` and `key2=value2`, use `nodeSelector.key1=value1`, `nodeSelector.key2=value2` correspondingly. | Optional| Optional |  Optional |
   |`installNvidiaDevicePlugin`  | `True` or `False`, default `False`. [NVIDIA Device Plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin#nvidia-device-plugin-for-kubernetes) is required for ML workloads on NVIDIA GPU hardware. By default, Azure Machine Learning extension deployment won't install NVIDIA Device Plugin regardless Kubernetes cluster has GPU hardware or not. User can specify this setting to `True`, to install it, but make sure to fulfill [Prerequisites](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin#prerequisites). | Optional |Optional |Optional |
   |`installPromOp`|`True` or `False`, default `True`. Azure Machine Learning extension needs prometheus operator to manage prometheus. Set to `False` to reuse the existing prometheus operator. For more information about reusing the existing  prometheus operator, see [reusing the prometheus operator](./how-to-troubleshoot-kubernetes-extension.md#prometheus-operator)| Optional| Optional |  Optional |
   |`installVolcano`| `True` or `False`, default `True`. Azure Machine Learning extension needs volcano scheduler to schedule the job. Set to `False` to reuse existing volcano scheduler. For more information about reusing the existing volcano scheduler, see [reusing volcano scheduler](./how-to-troubleshoot-kubernetes-extension.md#volcano-scheduler)   | Optional| N/A |  Optional |
   |`installDcgmExporter`  |`True` or `False`, default `False`. Dcgm-exporter can expose GPU metrics for Azure Machine Learning workloads, which can be monitored in Azure portal. Set `installDcgmExporter`  to `True` to install dcgm-exporter. But if you want to utilize your own dcgm-exporter, see [DCGM exporter](./how-to-troubleshoot-kubernetes-extension.md#dcgm-exporter) |Optional |Optional |Optional |


   |Configuration Protected Setting Key Name  |Description  |Training |Inference |Training and Inference
   |--|--|--|--|--|
   | `sslCertPemFile`, `sslKeyPemFile` |Path to TLS/SSL certificate and key file (PEM-encoded), required for Azure Machine Learning extension deployment with inference HTTPS endpoint support, when  ``allowInsecureConnections`` is set to False. **Note** PEM file with pass phrase protected isn't supported | N/A| Optional |  Optional |

As you can see from the configuration settings table, the combinations of different configuration settings allow you to deploy Azure Machine Learning extension for different ML workload scenarios:

  * For training job and batch inference workload, specify `enableTraining=True`
  * For inference workload only, specify `enableInference=True`
  * For all kinds of ML workload, specify both `enableTraining=True` and `enableInference=True`

If you plan to deploy Azure Machine Learning extension for real-time inference workload and want to specify `enableInference=True`, pay attention to following configuration settings related to real-time inference workload:

  * `azureml-fe` router service is required for real-time inference support and you need to specify `inferenceRouterServiceType` config setting for `azureml-fe`. `azureml-fe` can be deployed with one of following `inferenceRouterServiceType`:
      * Type `LoadBalancer`. Exposes `azureml-fe` externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. To specify this value, ensure that your cluster supports load balancer provisioning. Note most on-premises Kubernetes clusters might not support external load balancer.
      * Type `NodePort`. Exposes `azureml-fe` on each Node's IP at a static port. You'll be able to contact `azureml-fe`, from outside of cluster, by requesting `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. Using `NodePort` also allows you to set up your own load balancing solution and TLS/SSL termination for `azureml-fe`.
      * Type `ClusterIP`. Exposes `azureml-fe` on a cluster-internal IP, and it makes `azureml-fe` only reachable from within the cluster. For `azureml-fe` to serve inference requests coming outside of cluster, it requires you to set up your own load balancing solution and TLS/SSL termination for `azureml-fe`. 
   * To ensure high availability of `azureml-fe` routing service, Azure Machine Learning extension deployment by default creates three replicas of `azureml-fe` for clusters having three nodes or more. If your cluster has **less than 3 nodes**, set `inferenceRouterHA=False`.
   * You also want to consider using **HTTPS** to restrict access to model endpoints and secure the data that clients submit. For this purpose, you would need to specify either `sslSecret` config setting or combination of `sslKeyPemFile` and `sslCertPemFile` config-protected settings. 
   * By default, Azure Machine Learning extension deployment expects config settings for **HTTPS** support. For development or testing purposes, **HTTP** support is conveniently provided through config setting `allowInsecureConnections=True`.

## Azure Machine Learning extension deployment - CLI examples and Azure portal

### [Azure CLI](#tab/deploy-extension-with-cli)
To deploy Azure Machine Learning extension with CLI, use `az k8s-extension create` command passing in values for the mandatory parameters.

We list four typical extension deployment scenarios for reference. To deploy extension for your production usage, carefully read the complete list of [configuration settings](#review-azure-machine-learning-extension-configuration-settings).

- **Use AKS cluster in Azure for a quick proof of concept to run all kinds of ML workload, i.e., to run training jobs or to deploy models as online/batch endpoints**

   For Azure Machine Learning extension deployment on AKS cluster, make sure to specify `managedClusters` value for `--cluster-type` parameter. Run the following Azure CLI command to deploy Azure Machine Learning extension:
   ```azurecli
   az k8s-extension create --name <extension-name> --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --config enableTraining=True enableInference=True inferenceRouterServiceType=LoadBalancer allowInsecureConnections=True InferenceRouterHA=False --cluster-type managedClusters --cluster-name <your-AKS-cluster-name> --resource-group <your-RG-name> --scope cluster
   ```

- **Use Arc Kubernetes cluster outside of Azure for a quick proof of concept, to run training jobs only**

   For Azure Machine Learning extension deployment on [Arc Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview) cluster, you would need to specify `connectedClusters` value for `--cluster-type` parameter. Run the following Azure CLI command to deploy Azure Machine Learning extension:
   ```azurecli
   az k8s-extension create --name <extension-name> --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --config enableTraining=True --cluster-type connectedClusters --cluster-name <your-connected-cluster-name> --resource-group <your-RG-name> --scope cluster
   ```

- **Enable an AKS cluster in Azure for production training and inference workload**
   For Azure Machine Learning extension deployment on AKS, make sure to specify `managedClusters` value for `--cluster-type` parameter. Assuming your cluster has more than three nodes, and you use an Azure public load balancer and HTTPS for inference workload support. Run the following Azure CLI command to deploy Azure Machine Learning extension:
   ```azurecli
   az k8s-extension create --name <extension-name> --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --config enableTraining=True enableInference=True inferenceRouterServiceType=LoadBalancer sslCname=<ssl cname> --config-protected sslCertPemFile=<file-path-to-cert-PEM> sslKeyPemFile=<file-path-to-cert-KEY> --cluster-type managedClusters --cluster-name <your-AKS-cluster-name> --resource-group <your-RG-name> --scope cluster
   ```
- **Enable an [Arc Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview) cluster anywhere for production training and inference workload using NVIDIA GPUs**

   For Azure Machine Learning extension deployment on [Arc Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview) cluster, make sure to specify `connectedClusters` value for `--cluster-type` parameter. Assuming your cluster has more than three nodes, you use a NodePort service type and HTTPS for inference workload support, run following Azure CLI command to deploy Azure Machine Learning extension:
   ```azurecli
   az k8s-extension create --name <extension-name> --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --config enableTraining=True enableInference=True inferenceRouterServiceType=NodePort sslCname=<ssl cname> installNvidiaDevicePlugin=True installDcgmExporter=True --config-protected sslCertPemFile=<file-path-to-cert-PEM> sslKeyPemFile=<file-path-to-cert-KEY> --cluster-type connectedClusters --cluster-name <your-connected-cluster-name> --resource-group <your-RG-name> --scope cluster
   ```

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

The UI experience to deploy extension is only available for **[Arc Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview)**. If you have an AKS cluster without Azure Arc connection, you need to use CLI to deploy Azure Machine Learning extension.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), navigate to **Kubernetes - Azure Arc** and select your cluster.
1. Select **Extensions** (under **Settings**), and then select **+ Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-attach-kubernetes-to-workspace/deploy-extension-from-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding new extension to the Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster from Azure portal.":::

1. From the list of available extensions, select **Azure Machine Learning extension** to deploy the latest version of the extension.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-attach-kubernetes-to-workspace/deploy-extension-from-ui-extension-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Azure Machine Learning extension from Azure portal.":::

1. Follow the prompts to deploy the extension. You can customize the installation by configuring the installation in the tab of **Basics**, **Configurations** and **Advanced**.  For a detailed list of Azure Machine Learning extension configuration settings, see [Azure Machine Learning extension configuration settings](#review-azure-machine-learning-extension-configuration-settings).

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-attach-kubernetes-to-workspace/deploy-extension-from-ui-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configuring Azure Machine Learning extension settings from Azure portal.":::
1. On the **Review + create** tab, select **Create**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-attach-kubernetes-to-workspace/deploy-extension-from-ui-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deploying new extension to the Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster from Azure portal.":::

1. After the deployment completes, you're able to see the Azure Machine Learning extension in **Extension** page.  If the extension installation succeeds, you can see **Installed** for the **Install status**.

### Verify Azure Machine Learning extension deployment

1. Run the following CLI command to check Azure Machine Learning extension details:

   ```azurecli
   az k8s-extension show --name <extension-name> --cluster-type connectedClusters --cluster-name <your-connected-cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group>
   ```

1. In the response, look for "name" and "provisioningState": "Succeeded". Note it might show "provisioningState": "Pending" for the first few minutes.

1. If the provisioningState shows Succeeded, run the following command on your machine with the kubeconfig file pointed to your cluster to check that all pods under "azureml" namespace are in 'Running' state:

   ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n azureml
   ```

## Review Azure Machine Learning extension component

Upon Azure Machine Learning extension deployment completes, you can use `kubectl get deployments -n azureml` to see list of resources created in the cluster. It usually consists a subset of following resources per configuration settings specified.
