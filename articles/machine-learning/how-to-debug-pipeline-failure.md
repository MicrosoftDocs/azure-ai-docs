# Use Azure Machine Learning studio to debug pipeline failures

After you submit a pipeline job, you can select a link to the job in your workspace in Azure Machine Learning studio. The link opens the pipeline job detail page, where you can check results and debug failed pipeline jobs. This article explains how to use the pipeline job detail page and pipeline comparison (preview) to debug machine learning pipeline failures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Items marked (preview) in this article are currently in public preview. The preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Use outline to quickly find a node

On the pipeline job detail page, the **Outline** pane at left shows the overall structure of your pipeline job. Hover on any row and select the **Locate in canvas** icon to highlight that node on the canvas and open an information pane for the node on the right.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/outline-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing outline and locate in the canvas." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/outline.png":::

In the **Outline** pane, you can select the **Filter** icon to quickly filter the view to **Completed nodes only**, **Component only**, or **Data only**. You can also filter the list by entering node names or component names in the Search box, or by selecting **Add filter** and choosing from a list of filters.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/quick-filter-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing quick filter and search in the Outline pane." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/quick-filter.png":::

The left pane shows the matched nodes with more information including status, duration, and run time and date. You can sort the filtered nodes.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/sort-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sorting search results in the Outline pane." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/sort.png":::

## Check component logs and outputs

If your pipeline fails or gets stuck on a node, first view the logs.

![Animated screenshot showing how to check node logs.](media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/node-logs.gif)

1. Select the node to open the information pane at right.

1. Select the **Outputs + logs** tab to view all the outputs and logs from this node.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/log-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the user_logs in the node information pane." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/log-detail.png":::
   
   - The *user_logs* folder contains information about user code generated logs. This folder is open by default, and the *std_log.txt* log is selected. Your code's logs, such as print statements, appear in the *std_log.txt*.

   - The *system_logs* folder contains logs generated by Azure Machine Learning. To learn more, see [View and download diagnostic logs](how-to-log-view-metrics.md#view-and-download-diagnostic-logs).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't see those folders, the compute run time update might not be released to the compute cluster yet. You can look at *70_driver_log.txt* in the *azureml-logs* folder first.

## Compare pipeline jobs (preview)

You can compare different pipeline jobs to debug failure or other unexpected issues (preview). Pipeline comparison identifies the differences, such as topology, component properties, and job properties, between pipeline jobs.

You can compare successful and failed pipeline jobs to find differences that might make one pipeline job fail. You can debug a failed pipeline job by comparing it to a completed job, or debug a failed node in a pipeline by comparing it to a similar completed node.

To enable this feature in Azure Machine Learning studio, select the megaphone icon at top right to manage preview features. In the **Managed preview feature** panel, make sure **Compare pipeline jobs to debug failures or unexpected issues** is set to **Enabled**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/enable-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the preview feature toggled on." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/enable-preview.png":::

### Compare a failed pipeline job to a successful job

During iterative model development, you might clone and modify a successful baseline pipeline by changing a parameter, dataset, compute resource, or other setting. If the new pipeline fails, you can use pipeline comparison to help figure out the failure by identifying the changes from the parent pipeline.

For example, if your new pipeline failed due to an out-of-memory issue, you can use pipeline comparison to see what changes from the parent pipeline might cause memory issues.

#### Compare the pipeline with its parent

1. On the failed pipeline job page, select **Show lineage**.
1. Select the link in the **Cloned from** popup to open the parent pipeline job page in a new browser tab.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/draft-show-lineage.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the cloned from link, with the previous step, the lineage button highlighted." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/draft-show-lineage.png":::

1. On both pages, select **Add to compare** on the top menu bar to add both jobs to the **Compare** list.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/comparison-list-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the comparison list with a parent and child pipeline added." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/comparison-list.png":::

Once you add both pipelines to the comparison list, you can select **Compare details** or **Compare graph**.

#### Compare graph

**Compare graph** shows the graph topology changes between pipelines **A** and **B**. On the canvas, nodes specific to pipeline A are marked **A** and highlighted in red, and nodes specific to pipeline B are marked **B** and highlighted in green. A description of changes appears at the tops of nodes that have differences.

You can select any node to open a **Component information** pane, where you can see **Dataset properties** or **Component properties** like **parameters**, **runSettings**, and **outputSettings**. You can choose to **Show only differences** and to **Show differences inline**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/parameter-changed.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the parameter changed and the component information tab." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/parameter-changed.png":::

In this view, you can select **Show compare details** at upper right to open the pipeline **Comparison overview**, which shows the same information as the **Details comparison** page.

#### Compare details

To see overall pipeline and job metadata, properties, and differences, select **Compare details** in the compare list. The **Details comparison** page shows **Pipeline properties** and **Job properties** for both pipeline jobs.

- Pipeline properties include pipeline parameters, compute settings, and output settings.
- Run properties include run status, submit time and duration, and other run settings.


You can choose to **Show only differences** and **See differences inline**, or select **Compare graph** at upper right to open the graph topology comparison.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/compare-graph.png" alt-text="Screenshot of detail comparison with compare graph highlighted." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/compare-graph.png":::

The following screenshot shows an example of using the detail comparison where the **defaultCompute** setting might be the reason for failure.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/compute-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the comparison overview of the default compute." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/compute.png":::

### Compare a failed pipeline node to a similar completed node

If you only updated node properties, you can debug the node by comparing it with the same node in other jobs.

1. Right select a failed node and select **View jobs** to get a list of jobs.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/view-jobs-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a failed node with view jobs highlighted." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/view-jobs.png":::

1. Choose a completed job as a comparison target and open it.
1. On both job pages, select **Add to compare** on the top menu bar to add both jobs to the **Compare** list.
1. Once the two jobs are in the comparison list, select **Compare details** to show the differences.

## Share debug results

To share debug results with your teammates or other stakeholders, select **Share** on the top menu bar. You can choose to **Copy shareable link to graph** or **Copy pipeline job ID** to share with others.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/share-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the share button and the link you should copy." lightbox= "./media/how-to-debug-pipeline-failure/share.png":::
