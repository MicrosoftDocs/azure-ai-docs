To use Azure Machine Learning, you need a workspace. If you don't have one, complete [Create resources you need to get started](../quickstart-create-resources.md) to create a workspace and learn more about using it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your Azure Machine Learning workspace is configured with a managed virtual network, you might need to add outbound rules to allow access to the public Python package repositories. For more information, see [Scenario: Access public machine learning packages](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-managed-network#scenario-access-public-machine-learning-packages).
