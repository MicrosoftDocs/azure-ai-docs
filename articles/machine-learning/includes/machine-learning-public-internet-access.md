Azure Machine Learning requires both inbound and outbound access to the public internet. The following tables provide an overview of the required access and what purpose it serves. For service tags that end in `.region`, replace `region` with the Azure region that contains your workspace. For example, `Storage.westus`:

> [!TIP]
> The required tab lists the required inbound and outbound configuration. The situational tab lists optional inbound and outbound configurations required by specific configurations you might want to enable.

# [Required](#tab/required)

| Direction | Protocol &<br>ports | Service tag | Purpose |
| ----- |-----| ----- | ----- |
| Outbound | TCP: 80, 443 | `AzureActiveDirectory` | Authentication using Microsoft Entra ID. |
| Outbound | TCP: 443, 18881<br>UDP: 5831 | `AzureMachineLearning` | Using Azure Machine Learning services.<br>Python intellisense in notebooks uses port 18881.<br>Creating, updating, and deleting an Azure Machine Learning compute instance uses port 5831. |
| Outbound | ANY: 443 | `BatchNodeManagement.region` | Communication with Azure Batch back-end for Azure Machine Learning compute instances/clusters. |
| Outbound | TCP: 443 | `AzureResourceManager` | Creation of Azure resources with Azure Machine Learning, Azure CLI, and Azure Machine Learning SDK. |
| Outbound | TCP: 443 | `Storage.region` | Access data stored in the Azure Storage Account for compute cluster and compute instance. For information on preventing data exfiltration over this outbound, see [Data exfiltration protection](../how-to-prevent-data-loss-exfiltration.md). |
| Outbound | TCP: 443 | `AzureFrontDoor.FrontEnd`</br>* Not needed in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet. | Global entry point for [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com). Store images and environments for AutoML. For information on preventing data exfiltration over this outbound, see [Data exfiltration protection](../how-to-prevent-data-loss-exfiltration.md). |
| Outbound | TCP: 443 | `MicrosoftContainerRegistry.region`</br>**Note** that this  tag has a dependency on the `AzureFrontDoor.FirstParty` tag | Access docker images provided by Microsoft. Setup of the Azure Machine Learning router for Azure Kubernetes Service. |

# [Situational](#tab/situational)

| Direction | Protocol & <br>ports | Service tag | Purpose |
| ----- |-----| ----- | ----- |
| Inbound | TCP: 44224 | `AzureMachineLearning` | Create, update, and delete of Azure Machine Learning compute instance/cluster. **Required if instance/cluster configured with a Public IP option.**|
| Outbound | TCP: 8787 | `AzureMachineLearning` | Using Azure Machine Learning services.<br> **Port 8787 is required if you use RStudio.** |
| Outbound | TCP: 445 | `Storage.region` | Access data stored in the Azure Storage Account for compute cluster and compute instance. For information on preventing data exfiltration over this outbound, see [Data exfiltration protection](../how-to-prevent-data-loss-exfiltration.md).<br>**445 is only required if you have a firewall between your virtual network for Azure ML and a private endpoint for your storage accounts.**|
| Outbound | TCP: 443 | `AzureMonitor` | Used to log monitoring and metrics to App Insights and Azure Monitor. Only needed if you haven't [secured Azure Monitor](../how-to-secure-workspace-vnet.md#secure-azure-monitor-and-application-insights) for the workspace. </br>* This outbound is also used to log information for support incidents. |
| Outbound | TCP: 443 | `Keyvault.region` | Access the key vault for the Azure Batch service. Only needed if you enabled the [hbi_workspace](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace%28class%29#create-name--auth-none--subscription-id-none--resource-group-none--location-none--create-resource-group-true--sku--basic---friendly-name-none--storage-account-none--key-vault-none--app-insights-none--container-registry-none--cmk-keyvault-none--resource-cmk-uri-none--hbi-workspace-false--default-cpu-compute-target-none--default-gpu-compute-target-none--exist-ok-false--show-output-true-) flag when creating the workspace. |

> [!TIP]
> If you need the IP addresses instead of service tags, use one of the following options:
> * Download a list from [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519).
> * Use the Azure CLI [az network list-service-tags](/cli/azure/network#az-network-list-service-tags) command.
> * Use the Azure PowerShell [Get-AzNetworkServiceTag](/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworkservicetag) command.
> 
> The IP addresses may change periodically.

You may also need to allow __outbound__ traffic to Visual Studio Code and non-Microsoft sites for the installation of packages required by your machine learning project. The following table lists commonly used repositories for machine learning:

| Host name | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| `anaconda.com`</br>`*.anaconda.com` | Used to install default packages. |
| `*.anaconda.org` | Used to get repo data. |
| `pypi.org` | Used to list dependencies from the default index, if any, and the index isn't overwritten by user settings. If the index is overwritten, you must also allow `*.pythonhosted.org`. |
| `cloud.r-project.org` | Used when installing CRAN packages for R development. |
| `*.pytorch.org` | Used by some examples based on PyTorch. |
| `*.tensorflow.org` | Used by some examples based on TensorFlow. |
| `code.visualstudio.com` | Required to download and install Visual Studio Code desktop. This isn't required for Visual Studio Code Web. |
| `update.code.visualstudio.com`</br>`*.vo.msecnd.net` | Used to retrieve Visual Studio Code server bits that are installed on the compute instance through a setup script. |
| `marketplace.visualstudio.com`</br>`vscode.blob.core.windows.net`</br>`*.gallerycdn.vsassets.io` | Required to download and install Visual Studio Code extensions. These hosts enable the remote connection to Compute Instances provided by the Azure ML extension for Visual Studio Code. For more information, see [Connect to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance in Visual Studio Code](../how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote.md). |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-tools-for-ai/master/azureml_remote_websocket_server/*` | Used to retrieve websocket server bits, which are installed on the compute instance. The websocket server is used to transmit requests from Visual Studio Code client (desktop application) to Visual Studio Code server running on the compute instance.|

> [!NOTE]
> When using the [Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-ai) the remote compute instance will require an access to public repositories to install the packages required by the extension. If the compute instance requires a proxy to access these public repositories or the Internet, you will need to set and export the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables in the `~/.bashrc` file of the compute instance. This process can be automated at provisioning time by using a [custom script](../how-to-customize-compute-instance.md).

When using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Azure Machine Learning, allow the following traffic to the AKS VNet:

* General inbound/outbound requirements for AKS as described in the [Restrict egress traffic in Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/limit-egress-traffic) article.
* **Outbound** to mcr.microsoft.com.
* When deploying a model to an AKS cluster, use the guidance in the [Deploy ML models to Azure Kubernetes Service](../v1/how-to-deploy-azure-kubernetes-service.md#connectivity) article.
