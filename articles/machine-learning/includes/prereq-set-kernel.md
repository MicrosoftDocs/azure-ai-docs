## Set your kernel and open in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. On the top bar above your opened notebook, create a compute instance if you don't already have one.

1. If the compute instance is stopped, select **Start compute** and wait until it's running.

1. Wait until the compute instance is running. Then make sure that the kernel, found on the top right, is `Python 3.10 - SDK v2`. If not, use the dropdown list to select this kernel.

    If you don't see this kernel, verify that your compute instance is running. If it is, select the **Refresh** button on the top right of the notebook.

1. If you see a banner that says you need to be authenticated, select **Authenticate**.

1. You can run the notebook here, or open it in VS Code for a full integrated development environment (IDE) with the power of Azure Machine Learning resources. Select **Open in VS Code**, then select either the web or desktop option.  When launched this way, VS Code is attached to your compute instance, the kernel, and the workspace file system.
