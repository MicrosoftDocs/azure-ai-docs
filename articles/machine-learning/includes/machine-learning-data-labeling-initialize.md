After the labeling project is initialized, some aspects of the  project are immutable. You can't change the task type or dataset. You *can* modify labels and the URL for the task description. Carefully review the settings before you create the project. After you submit the project, you return to the **Data Labeling** overview page, which shows the project as **Initializing**.

> [!NOTE]
> The overview page might not automatically refresh. After a pause, manually refresh the page to see the project's status as **Created**.
