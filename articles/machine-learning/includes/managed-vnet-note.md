> [!TIP]
> You can use Azure Machine Learning **managed virtual networks** instead of the steps in this article. With a managed virtual network, Azure Machine Learning handles the job of network isolation for your workspace and managed computes. You can also add private endpoints for resources needed by the workspace, such as Azure Storage Account. For more information, see [Workspace managed network isolation](../how-to-managed-network.md).
