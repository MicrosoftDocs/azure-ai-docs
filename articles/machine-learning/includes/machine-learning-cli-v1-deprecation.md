> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the Azure CLI commands in this article use the `azure-cli-ml`, or v1, extension for Azure Machine Learning. Support for CLI v1 ended on September 30, 2025. Microsoft will no longer provide technical support or updates for this service. Your existing workflows using CLI v1 will continue to operate after the end-of-support date. However, they could be exposed to security risks or breaking changes in the event of architectural changes in the product.
>
> We recommend that you transition to the `ml`, or v2, extension as soon as possible. For more information on the v2 extension, see [Azure Machine Learning CLI extension and Python SDK v2](../concept-v2.md).
