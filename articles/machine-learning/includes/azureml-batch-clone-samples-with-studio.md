The example in this article is based on code samples contained in the [azureml-examples](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples) repository. To run the commands locally without having to copy/paste YAML and other files, first clone the repo and then change directories to the folder:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples --depth 1
cd azureml-examples/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-models/mnist-classifier
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```azurecli
!git clone https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples --depth 1
!cd azureml-examples/sdk/python/endpoints/batch/deploy-models/mnist-classifier
```

To follow along with this example in a Jupyter Notebook, in the cloned repository, open the notebook: [mnist-batch.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/endpoints/batch/deploy-models/mnist-classifier/mnist-batch.ipynb).

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

1. On the left pane, select the option __Notebooks__.
1. Select __Samples__.
1. Navigate to the folder _SDK v2/sdk/python/endpoints/batch/deploy-models/mnist-classifier_.
1. Select the notebook __mnist-batch.ipynb__.
1. Select __Clone this notebook__.
