The **default managed identity** is the system-assigned managed identity or the first user-assigned managed identity.

During a run there are two applications of an identity:

1. The system uses an identity to set up the user's storage mounts, container registry, and datastores.

    * In this case, the system will use the default-managed identity.

1. The user applies an identity to access resources from within the code for a submitted run

    * In this case, provide the *client_id* corresponding to the managed identity you want to use to retrieve a credential.
    * Alternatively, get the user-assigned identity's client ID through the *DEFAULT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID* environment variable.

    For example, to retrieve a token for a datastore with the default-managed identity:

    ```python
    client_id = os.environ.get('DEFAULT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID')
    credential = ManagedIdentityCredential(client_id=client_id)
    token = credential.get_token('https://storage.azure.com/')
    ```
