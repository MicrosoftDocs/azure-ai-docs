### Check installed packages

Follow these steps to address issues with installed packages.

1. Gather information about installed packages and versions for your Python environment.

1. Confirm that the `azureml-inference-server-http` Python package version specified in the environment file matches the Azure Machine Learning inference HTTP server version displayed in the [startup log](../how-to-inference-server-http.md#view-startup-logs).

   In some cases, the pip dependency resolver installs unexpected package versions. You might need to run `pip` to correct installed packages and versions.

1. If you specify the Flask or its dependencies in your environment, remove these items.

   - Dependent packages include `flask`, `jinja2`, `itsdangerous`, `werkzeug`, `markupsafe`, and `click`.
   - `flask` is listed as a dependency in the server package. The best approach is to allow the inference server to install the `flask` package.
   - When the inference server is configured to support new versions of Flask, the server automatically receives the package updates as they become available.

### Check server version

The `azureml-inference-server-http` server package is published to PyPI. The [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/azureml-inference-server-http/) lists the changelog and all previous versions.

If you're using an earlier package version, update your configuration to the latest version. The following table summarizes stable versions, common issues, and recommended adjustments:

| Package version | Description | Issue | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0.4.x** | Bundled in training images dated `20220601` or earlier and `azureml-defaults` package versions `.1.34` through `1.43`. Latest stable version is **0.4.13**. | For server versions earlier than **0.4.11**, you might encounter Flask dependency issues, such as `"can't import name Markup from jinja2"`. | Upgrade to version **0.4.13** or **0.8.x**, the latest version, if possible. |
| **0.6.x** | Preinstalled in inferencing images dated `20220516` and earlier. Latest stable version is **0.6.1**. | N/A | N/A |
| **0.7.x** | Supports Flask 2. Latest stable version is **0.7.7**. | N/A | N/A |
| **0.8.x** | Log format changed. Python 3.6 support ended. | N/A | N/A |

<!-- Reviewer: Confirm if other versions or common issues + resolutions should be listed. The last major update to this topic was about 2 years ago. -->

### Check package dependencies

The most relevant dependent packages for the `azureml-inference-server-http` server package include:

- `flask`
- `opencensus-ext-azure`
- `inference-schema`
  
If you specified the `azureml-defaults` package in your Python environment, the `azureml-inference-server-http` package is a dependent package. The dependency is installed automatically.

> [!TIP]
> If you use Python SDK v1 and don't explicitly specify the `azureml-defaults` package in your Python environment, the SDK might automatically add the package. However, the packager version is locked relative to the SDK version. For example, if the SDK version is `1.38.0`, then the `azureml-defaults==1.38.0` entry is added to the environment's pip requirements.

### TypeError during server startup

You might encounter the following `TypeError` during server startup:

```bash
TypeError: register() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given

  File "/var/azureml-server/aml_blueprint.py", line 251, in register

    super(AMLBlueprint, self).register(app, options, first_registration)

TypeError: register() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
```

This error occurs when you have Flask 2 installed in your Python environment, but your `azureml-inference-server-http` package version doesn't support Flask 2. Support for Flask 2 is available in `azureml-inference-server-http` package version **0.7.0** and later, and `azureml-defaults` package version **1.44** and later.

- If you don't use the Flask 2 package in an Azure Machine Learning Docker image, use the latest version of the `azureml-inference-server-http` or `azureml-defaults` package.
- If you use the Flask 2 package in an Azure Machine Learning Docker image, confirm that the image build version is **July 2022** or later.

  You can find the image version in the container logs. For example:

  ```console
  2022-08-22T17:05:02,147738763+00:00 | gunicorn/run | AzureML Container Runtime Information
  2022-08-22T17:05:02,161963207+00:00 | gunicorn/run | ###############################################
  2022-08-22T17:05:02,168970479+00:00 | gunicorn/run | 
  2022-08-22T17:05:02,174364834+00:00 | gunicorn/run | 
  2022-08-22T17:05:02,187280665+00:00 | gunicorn/run | AzureML image information: openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04, Materialization Build:20220708.v2
  2022-08-22T17:05:02,188930082+00:00 | gunicorn/run | 
  2022-08-22T17:05:02,190557998+00:00 | gunicorn/run | 
  ```

  The build date of the image appears after the `Materialization Build` notation. In the preceding example, the image version is `20220708` or July 8, 2022. The image in this example is compatible with Flask 2.

  If you don't see a similar message in your container log, your image is out-of-date and should be updated. If you use a Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) image, and you can't find a newer image, check if your image is deprecated in [AzureML-Containers](https://github.com/Azure/AzureML-Containers). You can find designated replacements for deprecated images.

  If you use the server with an online endpoint, you can also find the logs in the **Logs** on the **Endpoints** page in Azure Machine Learning studio.

If you deploy with SDK v1, and don't explicitly specify an image in your deployment configuration, the server applies the `openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04` package with a version that matches your local SDK toolset. However, the version installed might not be the latest available version of the image.

For SDK version 1.43, the server installs the `openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:20220616` package version by default, but this package version isn't compatible with SDK 1.43. Make sure you use the latest SDK for your deployment.

If you can't update the image, you can temporarily avoid the issue by pinning the `azureml-defaults==1.43` or `azureml-inference-server-http~=0.4.13` entries in your environment file. These entries direct the server to install the older version with `flask 1.0.x`.

### ImportError or ModuleNotFoundError during server startup

You might encounter an `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError` on specific modules, such as  `opencensus`, `jinja2`, `markupsafe`, or `click`, during server startup. The following example shows the error message:

```bash
ImportError: cannot import name 'Markup' from 'jinja2'
```

The import and module errors occur when you use version **0.4.10** or earlier versions of the server that don't pin the Flask dependency to a compatible version. To prevent the issue, install a later version of the server.
