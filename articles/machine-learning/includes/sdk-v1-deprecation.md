> This article provides information on using the Azure Machine Learning SDK v1. SDK v1 is deprecated as of March 31, 2025. Support for it will end on June 30, 2026. You can install and use SDK v1 until that date. Your existing workflows using SDK v1 will continue to operate after the end-of-support date. However, they could be exposed to security risks or breaking changes in the event of architectural changes in the product.
