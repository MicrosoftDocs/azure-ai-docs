> [!TIP]
> An Azure Application Insights instance is created when you create the workspace. You can delete the Application Insights instance after cluster creation if you want. Deleting it limits the information gathered from the workspace, and might make it more difficult to troubleshoot problems. **If you delete the Application Insights instance created by the workspace, the only way to recreate it is to delete and recreate the workspace**.
>
> For more information on using the Application Insights instance, see [Monitor and collect data from Machine Learning web service endpoints](../how-to-enable-app-insights.md).
