In this article, learn how to troubleshoot common problems you may encounter with environment image builds and learn about AzureML environment vulnerabilities.

We are actively seeking your feedback! If you navigated to this page via your Environment Definition or Build Failure Analysis logs, we'd like to know if the feature was helpful to you, or if you'd like to report a failure scenario that isn't yet covered by our analysis. You can also leave feedback on this documentation. Leave your thoughts [here](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/log-analysis-feedback). 

## Azure Machine Learning environments

Azure Machine Learning environments are an encapsulation of the environment where your machine learning training happens.
They specify the base docker image, Python packages, and software settings around your training and scoring scripts.
Environments are managed and versioned assets within your Machine Learning workspace that enable reproducible, auditable, and portable machine learning workflows across various compute targets.

### Types of environments

Environments fall under three categories: curated, user-managed, and system-managed.

Curated environments are pre-created environments managed by Azure Machine Learning and are available by default in every workspace. They contain collections of Python packages and settings to help you get started with various machine learning frameworks, and you're meant to use them as is.
These pre-created environments also allow for faster deployment time.

In user-managed environments, you're responsible for setting up your environment and installing every package that your training script needs on the compute target.
Also be sure to include any dependencies needed for model deployment.

These types of environments have two subtypes. For the first type, BYOC (bring your own container), you bring an existing Docker image to Azure Machine Learning. For the second type, Docker build context based environments, Azure Machine Learning materializes the image from the context that you provide.

When you want conda to manage the Python environment for you, use a system-managed environment.
Azure Machine Learning creates a new isolated conda environment by materializing your conda specification on top of a base Docker image. By default, Azure Machine Learning adds common features to the derived image.
Any Python packages present in the base image aren't available in the isolated conda environment.

### Create and manage environments

You can create and manage environments from clients like Azure Machine Learning Python SDK, Azure Machine Learning CLI, Azure Machine Learning studio UI, Visual Studio Code extension. 

"Anonymous" environments are automatically registered in your workspace when you submit an experiment without registering or referencing an already existing environment.
They aren't listed but you can retrieve them by version or label.

Azure Machine Learning builds environment definitions into Docker images.
It also caches the images in the Azure Container Registry associated with your Azure Machine Learning Workspace so they can be reused in subsequent training jobs and service endpoint deployments.
Multiple environments with the same definition may result in the same cached image.

Running a training script remotely requires the creation of a Docker image.

## Vulnerabilities in AzureML Environments

You can address vulnerabilities by upgrading to a newer version of a dependency (base image, Python package, etc.) or by migrating to a different dependency that satisfies security
requirements. Mitigating vulnerabilities is time consuming and costly since it can require refactoring of code and infrastructure. With the prevalence
of open source software and the use of complicated nested dependencies, it's important to manage and keep track of vulnerabilities.

There are some ways to decrease the impact of vulnerabilities:

- Reduce your number of dependencies - use the minimal set of the dependencies for each scenario.
- Compartmentalize your environment so you can scope and fix issues in one place.
- Understand flagged vulnerabilities and their relevance to your scenario.

### Scan for Vulnerabilities 

You can monitor and maintain environment hygiene with [Microsoft Defender for Container Registry](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-vulnerability-assessment-azure) to help scan images for vulnerabilities. 

To automate this process based on triggers from Microsoft Defender, see [Automate responses to Microsoft Defender for Cloud triggers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation).

### Vulnerabilities vs Reproducibility

Reproducibility is one of the foundations of software development. When you're developing production code, a repeated operation must guarantee the same
result. Mitigating vulnerabilities can disrupt reproducibility by changing dependencies.

Azure Machine Learning's primary focus is to guarantee reproducibility. Environments fall under three categories: curated,
user-managed, and system-managed.

### *Curated Environments*

Curated environments are pre-created environments that Azure Machine Learning manages and are available by default in every Azure Machine Learning workspace provisioned. New versions are released by Azure Machine Learning to address vulnerabilities. Whether you use the latest image may be a tradeoff between reproducibility and vulnerability management. 

Curated Environments contain collections of Python packages and settings to help you get started with various machine learning frameworks. You're meant to use them as is. These pre-created environments also allow for faster deployment time.

### *User-managed Environments*

In user-managed environments, you're responsible for setting up your environment and installing every package that your training script needs on the
compute target and for model deployment. These types of environments have two subtypes:

- BYOC (bring your own container): the user provides a Docker image to Azure Machine Learning
- Docker build context: Azure Machine Learning materializes the image from the user provided content

Once you install more dependencies on top of a Microsoft-provided image, or bring your own base image, vulnerability management becomes your responsibility.

### *System-managed Environments* 

You use system-managed environments when you want conda to manage the Python environment for you. Azure Machine Learning creates a new isolated conda environment by materializing your conda specification on top of a base Docker image. While Azure Machine Learning patches base images with each release, whether you use the
latest image may be a tradeoff between reproducibility and vulnerability management. So, it's your responsibility to choose the environment version used
for your jobs or model deployments while using system-managed environments.

### Vulnerabilities: Common Issues 

### *Vulnerabilities in Base Docker Images* 

System vulnerabilities in an environment are usually introduced from the base image. For example, vulnerabilities marked as "Ubuntu" or "Debian" are from the system level of the environmentâ€“the base Docker image. If the base image is from a third-party issuer, please check if the latest version has fixes for the flagged vulnerabilities. Most common sources for the base images in Azure Machine Learning are:

- Microsoft Artifact Registry (MAR) aka Microsoft Container Registry (mcr.microsoft.com). 
    - Images can be listed from MAR homepage, calling _catalog API, or [/tags/list](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04/tags/list)_
    - Source and release notes for training base images from AzureML can be found in [Azure/AzureML-Containers](https://github.com/Azure/AzureML-Containers)
- Nvidia (nvcr.io, or [nvidia's Profile](https://hub.docker.com/u/nvidia/#!))

If the latest version of your base image does not resolve your vulnerabilities, base image vulnerabilities can be addressed by installing versions recommended by a vulnerability scan:

```
apt-get install -y library_name
```

### *Vulnerabilities in Python Packages* 

Vulnerabilities can also be from installed Python packages on top of the system-managed base image. These Python-related vulnerabilities should be resolved by updating your Python dependencies. Python (pip) vulnerabilities in the image usually come from user-defined dependencies.

To search for known Python vulnerabilities and solutions please see [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories). To address Python vulnerabilities, update the package to the version that has fixes for the flagged issue:

```
pip install -u my_package=={good.version}
```

If you're using a conda environment, update the reference in the conda dependencies file.

In some cases, Python packages will be automatically installed during conda's setup of your environment on top of a base Docker image. Mitigation steps for those are the same as those for user-introduced packages. Conda installs necessary dependencies for every environment it materializes. Packages like cryptography, setuptools, wheel, etc. will be automatically installed from conda's default channels. There's a known issue with the default anaconda channel missing latest package versions, so it's recommended to prioritize the community-maintained conda-forge channel. Otherwise, please explicitly specify packages and versions, even if you don't reference them in the code you plan to execute on that environment.

### *Cache issues* 

Associated to your Azure Machine Learning workspace is an Azure Container Registry instance that's a cache for container images. Any image
materialized is pushed to the container registry and used if you trigger experimentation or deployment for the corresponding environment. Azure
Machine Learning doesn't delete images from your container registry, and it's your responsibility to evaluate which images you need to maintain over time.

## **Environment definition problems**

## *Environment name issues*
### Curated prefix not allowed
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when the name of your custom environment uses terms reserved only for curated environments. *Curated* environments are environments that Microsoft maintains. *Custom* environments are environments that you create and maintain.
 
**Potential causes:**
* Your environment name starts with *Microsoft* or *AzureML*
 
**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in registering your environment
<!--/issueDescription-->
 
**Troubleshooting steps**

 Update your environment name to exclude the reserved prefix you're currently using

### Missing conda channels
<!--issueDescription-->
**Potential causes:**
* You haven't specified conda channels in your environment definition

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in registering your environment
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

For reproducibility of your environment, specify channels from which to pull dependencies. If you don't specify conda channels, conda uses defaults that might change.

:::moniker range="azureml-api-1"

### Base conda environment not recommended
<!--issueDescription-->
**Potential causes:**
* You specified a base conda environment in your environment definition

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in registering your environment
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

Partial environment updates can lead to dependency conflicts and/or unexpected runtime errors, so the use of base conda environments isn't recommended.

### Unpinned dependencies
<!--issueDescription-->
**Potential causes:**
* You didn't specify versions for certain packages in your conda specification

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in registering your environment
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

If you don't specify a dependency version, the conda package resolver may choose a different version of the package on subsequent builds of the same environment. This breaks reproducibility of the environment and can lead to unexpected errors.

:::moniker range="azureml-api-1"

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-sdk-v1](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

Include version numbers when adding packages to your conda specification

```python
from azureml.core.environment import CondaDependencies

conda_dep = CondaDependencies()
conda_dep.add_conda_package("numpy==1.24.1")
```

:::moniker-end

If you're using a YAML for your conda specification, specify versions for your dependencies

```yaml
name: project_environment
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - pip:
      - numpy=1.24.1
channels:
  - anaconda
  - conda-forge
```

## *Pip issues*
### Pip not specified
<!--issueDescription-->
**Potential causes:**
* You didn't specify pip as a dependency in your conda specification

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in registering your environment
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

For reproducibility, you should specify and pin pip as a dependency in your conda specification.

:::moniker range="azureml-api-1"

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-sdk-v1](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

Specify pip as a dependency, along with its version

```python
env.python.conda_dependencies.add_conda_package("pip==22.3.1")
```

:::moniker-end

If you're using a YAML for your conda specification, specify pip as a dependency

```yaml

      - numpy=1.24.1
channels:
  - anaconda
  - conda-forge
```

**Resources**
* See [conda package pinning](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/how-to-pin-conda-packages)

### Pip not pinned
<!--issueDescription-->
**Potential causes:**
* You didn't specify a version for pip in your conda specification

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in registering your environment
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

If you don't specify a pip version, a different version may be used on subsequent builds of the same environment. This behavior can cause reproducibility issues and other unexpected errors if different versions of pip resolve your packages differently.

:::moniker range="azureml-api-1"

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-sdk-v1](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

Specify a pip version in your conda dependencies

```python

## *Miscellaneous environment issues*
### R section is deprecated
<!--issueDescription-->
**Potential causes:**
* You specified an R section in your environment definition

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in registering your environment
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

The Azure Machine Learning SDK for R was deprecated at the end of 2021 to make way for an improved R training and deployment experience using the Azure CLI v2

:::moniker range="azureml-api-1"

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-sdk-v1](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v1.md)]

Remove the R section from your environment definition

```python
env.r = None
```

:::moniker-end

See the [samples repository](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/train-r-models-cli-v2) to get started training R models using the Azure CLI v2

### No definition exists for environment
<!--issueDescription-->
**Potential causes:**
* You specified an environment that doesn't exist or hasn't been registered
* There was a misspelling or syntactical error in the way you specified your environment name or environment version

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in registering your environment
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

Ensure that you're specifying your environment name correctly, along with the correct version
* `path-to-resource:version-number`

You should specify the 'latest' version of your environment in a different way
* `path-to-resource@latest`

## **Image build problems**

## *ACR issues*
### ACR unreachable
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when there's a failure in accessing a workspace's associated Azure Container Registry (ACR) resource.

**Potential causes:**
* Your workspace's ACR is behind a virtual network (VNet) (private endpoint or service endpoint), and you aren't using a compute cluster to build images.
* Your workspace's ACR is behind a virtual network (VNet) (private endpoint or service endpoint), and the compute cluster used for building images has no access to the workspace's ACR.

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because Azure Machine Learning implicitly builds the environment in the first step.
* Pipeline job failures.
* Model deployment failures.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**
* Verify the compute cluster's VNet has access to the workspace's ACR.
* Ensure the compute cluster is CPU based.

> [!NOTE]
> * Only Azure Machine Learning compute clusters are supported. Compute, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or other instance types are not supported for image build compute.

**Resources**
* [Enable Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/acr-private-endpoint)
* [How To Use Environments](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/how-to-use-environments)

### Unexpected Dockerfile Format
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when your Dockerfile is formatted incorrectly.

**Potential causes:**
* Your Dockerfile contains invalid syntax
* Your Dockerfile contains characters that aren't compatible with UTF-8

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because it will implicitly build the environment in the first step.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**
* Ensure Dockerfile is formatted correctly and is encoded in UTF-8

**Resources**
* [Dockerfile format](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#format)

## *Docker pull issues*
### Failed to pull Docker image
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when a Docker image pull fails during an image build.

**Potential causes:**
* The path name to the container registry is incorrect
* A container registry behind a virtual network is using a private endpoint in an [unsupported region](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/private-link-availability)
* The image you're trying to reference doesn't exist in the container registry you specified 
* You haven't provided credentials for a private registry you're trying to pull the image from, or the provided credentials are incorrect

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because Azure Machine Learning implicitly builds the environment in the first step.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

Check that the path name to your container registry is correct
* For a registry `my-registry.io` and image `test/image` with tag `3.2`, a valid image path would be `my-registry.io/test/image:3.2`
* See [registry path documentation](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/docker-registries)

If your container registry is behind a virtual network or is using a private endpoint in an [unsupported region](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/private-link-availability)
* Configure the container registry by using the service endpoint (public access) from the portal and retry
* After you put the container registry behind a virtual network, run the [Azure Resource Manager template](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/secure-resources-using-vnet) so the workspace can communicate with the container registry instance

If the image you're trying to reference doesn't exist in the container registry you specified
* Check that you've used the correct tag and that you've set `user_managed_dependencies` to `True`. Setting [user_managed_dependencies](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/environment-python-section) to `True` disables conda and uses the user's installed packages

If you haven't provided credentials for a private registry you're trying to pull from, or the provided credentials are incorrect
* Set [workspace connections](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/resources/connections/connections.ipynb) for the container registry if needed

**Resources**
* [Workspace connections v1](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/set-connection-v1)

### I/O Error
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when a Docker image pull fails due to a network issue.  

**Potential causes:**
* Network connection issue, which could be temporary
* Firewall is blocking the connection
* ACR is unreachable and there's network isolation. For more information, see [ACR unreachable](#acr-unreachable). 

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because Azure Machine Learning implicitly builds the environment in the first step.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**  

Add the host to the firewall rules  
* See [configure inbound and outbound network traffic](how-to-access-azureml-behind-firewall.md) to learn how to use Azure Firewall for your workspace and resources behind a VNet

Assess your workspace set-up. Are you using a virtual network, or are any of the resources you're trying to access during your image build behind a virtual network?
* Ensure that you've followed the steps in this article on [securing a workspace with virtual networks](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/acr-private-endpoint)
* Azure Machine Learning requires both inbound and outbound access to the public internet. If there's a problem with your virtual network setup, there might be an issue with accessing certain repositories required during your image build  

If you aren't using a virtual network, or if you've configured it correctly
* Try rebuilding your image. If the timeout was due to a network issue, the problem might be transient, and a rebuild could fix the problem

## *Conda issues during build*
### Bad spec
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when a package listed in your conda specification is invalid or when you've executed a conda command incorrectly.

**Potential causes:**
* The syntax you used in your conda specification is incorrect
* You're executing a conda command incorrectly

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because Azure Machine Learning implicitly builds the environment in the first step.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

Conda spec errors can happen if you use the conda create command incorrectly
* Read the [documentation](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/conda-create) and ensure that you're using valid options and syntax
* There's known confusion regarding `conda env create` versus `conda create`. You can read more about conda's response and other users' known solutions [here](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/conda-env-create-known-issue)

To ensure a successful build, ensure that you're using proper syntax and valid package specification in your conda yaml
* See [package match specifications](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/conda-package-match-specifications) and [how to create a conda file manually](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/how-to-create-conda-file)

### Communications error
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when there's a failure in communicating with the entity from which you wish to download packages listed in your conda specification.

**Potential causes:**
* Failed to communicate with a conda channel or a package repository
* These failures may be due to transient network failures 

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because Azure Machine Learning implicitly builds the environment in the first step.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

Ensure that the conda channels/repositories you're using in your conda specification are correct
* Check that they exist and that you've spelled them correctly

If the conda channels/repositories are correct
* Try to rebuild the image--there's a chance that the failure is transient, and a rebuild might fix the issue
* Check to make sure that the packages listed in your conda specification exist in the channels/repositories you specified

### Compile error
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when there's a failure building a package required for the conda environment due to a compiler error.

**Potential causes:**
* You spelled a package incorrectly and therefore it wasn't recognized
* There's something wrong with the compiler

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because Azure Machine Learning implicitly builds the environment in the first step.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

If you're using a compiler
* Ensure that the compiler you're using is recognized
* If needed, add an installation step to your Dockerfile
* Verify the version of your compiler and check that all commands or options you're using are compatible with the compiler version
* If necessary, upgrade your compiler version

Ensure that you've spelled all listed packages correctly and that you've pinned versions correctly

<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when conda package resolution takes too long to complete.

**Potential causes:**
* There's a large number of packages listed in your conda specification and unnecessary packages are included
* You haven't pinned your dependencies (you included tensorflow instead of tensorflow=2.8)
* You've listed packages for which there's no solution (you included package X=1.3 and Y=2.8, but X's version is incompatible with Y's version)

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because Azure Machine Learning implicitly builds the environment in the first step.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**
* Remove any packages from your conda specification that are unnecessary
* Pin your packages--environment resolution is faster
