# Algorithm & component reference for Azure Machine Learning designer (v2)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of the Azure Machine Learning SDK you are using:"]

Azure Machine Learning designer components (Designer) allow users to create machine learning projects using a drag and drop interface. Follow this link to reach the Designer studio. Follow this link to [learn more about Designer](../concept-designer.md).


This reference content provides background on each of the custom components (v2) available in Azure Machine Learning designer.

You can navigate to Custom components in Azure Machine Learning studio as shown in the following image.

Each component represents a set of code that can run independently and perform a machine learning task, given the required inputs. A component might contain a particular algorithm, or perform a task that is important in machine learning, such as missing value replacement, or statistical analysis.

For help with choosing algorithms, see 
* [How to select algorithms](../v1/how-to-select-algorithms.md)

> [!TIP]
> In any pipeline in the designer, you can get information about a specific component. Select the **Learn more** link in the component card when hovering on the component in the component list, or in the right pane of the component.
