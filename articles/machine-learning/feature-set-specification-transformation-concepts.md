# Feature transformation and best practices

This article describes feature set specifications, the different kinds of transformations that can be used with them, and related best practices.

A feature set is a collection of features generated by source data transformations. A feature set specification is a self-contained definition for feature set development and local testing. After development and local testing of a feature set, you can register that feature set as a feature set asset with the feature store. You then have versioning and materialization available as managed capabilities.

## Define a feature set

`FeatureSetSpec` defines a feature set. This sample shows a feature set specification file:

```yaml
$schema: http://azureml/sdk-2-0/FeatureSetSpec.json

source:
  type: parquet
  path: abfs://file_system@account_name.dfs.core.windows.net/datasources/transactions-source/*.parquet
  timestamp_column: # name of the column representing the timestamp.
    name: timestamp
  source_delay:
    days: 0
    hours: 3
    minutes: 0
feature_transformation:
  transformation_code:
    path: ./transformation_code
    transformer_class: transaction_transform.TransactionFeatureTransformer
features:
  - name: transaction_7d_count
    type: long
  - name: transaction_amount_7d_sum
    type: double
  - name: transaction_amount_7d_avg
    type: double
  - name: transaction_3d_count
    type: long
  - name: transaction_amount_3d_sum
    type: double
  - name: transaction_amount_3d_avg
    type: double
index_columns:
  - name: accountID
    type: string
source_lookback:
  days: 7
  hours: 0
  minutes: 0
temporal_join_lookback:
  days: 1
  hours: 0
  minutes: 0
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `featurestore` core SDK autogenerates the feature set specification `YAML`. [This tutorial](./tutorial-get-started-with-feature-store.md) has an example.

In the `FeatureSetSpec` definition, these properties have relevance to feature transformation:

- `source`: defines the source data and relevant metadata - for example, the timestamp column in the data. Currently, only time-series source data and features are supported. The `source.timestamp_column` property is mandatory
- `feature_transformation.transformation_code`: defines the code folder location of the feature transformer
- `features`: defines the feature schema generated by the feature transformer
- `index_columns`: defines the index column(s) schema that the feature transformer generates
- `source_lookback`: this property is used when the feature handles aggregation on time-series (for example, window aggregation) data. The value of this property indicates the required time range of source data in the past, for a feature value at time T. The [Best Practice](#set-proper-source_lookback) section has details.

### How are features calculated?

After you define a `FeatureSetSpec`, invoke `featureSetSpec.to_spark_dataframe(feature_window_start_ts, feature_window_end_ts)` to calculate features on a given feature window.

The calculation happens in these steps:

- Read data from the source data. The `source` defines the source data. Filter the data by the time range `[feature_window_start_ts - source_lookback, feature_window_end_ts)`. The time range includes the start of the window, and excludes the end of the window
- Apply the feature transformer, defined by `feature_transformation.transformation_code`, on the data, and get the calculated features
- Filter the feature values to return only those feature records within the feature window `[feature_window_start_ts, feature_window_end_ts)`

In this code sample, the feature store API calculates the features:

```python
# define the source data time window according to feature window
source_window_start_ts = feature_window_start_ts - source_lookback
source_window_end_ts = feature_window_end_ts

# read source table into a dataframe
df1 = spark.read.parquet(source.path).filter(df1["timestamp"] >= source_window_start_ts && df1["timestamp"] < source_window_end_ts)

# apply the feature transformer
df2 = FeatureTransformer._transform(df1)

## filter the feature(set) to include only feature records within the feature window
feature_set_df = df2.filter(df2["timestamp"] >= feature_window_start_ts && df2["timestamp"] < feature_window_end_ts)
```

### Output schema of the feature transformer function

The transform function outputs a dataframe, which includes these values in its schema:

- Index columns that match the `FeatureSetSpec` definition, both in name and type
- The timestamp column (name) that matches the timestamp definition in the `source`. The `source` is found in `FeatureSetSpec`
- Define all other column name/type values as `features` in `FeatureSetSpec`

## Implement feature transformer for common types of transformations

### Row-level transformation

In a row-level transformation, a feature value calculation on a specific row only uses column values of that row. Start with this source data:

| `user_id` | `timestamp` | `total_spend` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2022-12-19 06:00:00 | 12.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-10 03:00:00 | 56.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-25 13:00:00 | 112.00 |

Define a new feature set named `user_total_spend_profile`:

```python
from pyspark.sql import Dataframe
from pyspark.ml import Transformer

class UserTotalSpendProfileTransformer(Transformer):

    def _transform(df: Dataframe) -> Dataframe:
        df.withColumn("is_high_spend_user", col("total_spend") > 100.0) \
           .withColumn("is_low_spend_user", col("total_spend") < 20.0)
```

The feature set has three features, with data types as shown:

- `total_spend`: double
- `is_high_spend_user`: bool
- `is_low_spend_user`: bool

This shows the calculated feature values:

| `user_id` | `timestamp` | `total_spend`| `is_high_spend_user` | `is_low_spend_user`|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2022-12-19 06:00:00 | 12.00 | false| true |
| 2 | 2022-12-10 03:00:00 | 56.00 | false| false |
| 1 | 2022-12-25 13:00:00 | 112.00 | true | false |

### Sliding window aggregation

Sliding window aggregation can help handle feature values that present statistics (for example, sum, average, etc.) that accumulate over time. The SparkSQL `Window` function defines a sliding window around each row in the data, which is useful in these cases.

For each row, the `Window` object can look into both the future and the past. In the context of machine learning features, you should define the `Window` object to look only in the past, for each row. Visit the [Best Practice](#prevent-data-leakage-in-feature-transformation) section for more information.

Start with this source data:

| `user_id` | `timestamp` | `spend` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2022-12-10 06:00:00 | 12.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-10 03:00:00 | 56.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 01:00:00 | 10.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-11 20:00:00 | 10.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-12 02:00:00 | 100.00 |

Define a new feature set named `user_rolling_spend`. This feature set includes rolling 1-day and 3-day total spending, by user:

```python
from pyspark.sql import Dataframe
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.ml import Transformer

class UserRollingSpend(Transformer):

    def _transform(df: Dataframe) -> Dataframe:
        days = lambda i: i * 86400
        w_1d = (Window.partitionBy("user_id").orderBy(F.col("timestamp").cast('long'))\
                .rangeBetween(-days(1), 0))
        w_3d = (Window.partitionBy("user_id").orderBy(F.col("timestamp").cast('long')).\
                rangeBetween(-days(3), 0))
        res = df.withColumn("spend_1d_sum", F.sum("spend").over(w_1d)) \
            .withColumn("spend_3d_sum", F.sum("spend").over(w_3d)) \
            .select("user_id", "timestamp", "spend_1d_sum", "spend_3d_sum")
        return res
    
```

The `user_rolling_spend` feature set has two features:

- `spend_1d_sum`: double
- `spend_3d_sum`: double

This shows its calculated feature values:

| `user_id` | `timestamp` | `spend_1d_sum` | `spend_3d_sum` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2022-12-10 06:00:00 | 12.00 | 12.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-10 03:00:00 | 56.00 | 56.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 01:00:00 | 22.00 | 22.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-11 20:00:00 | 10.00 | 66.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-12 02:00:00 | 110.00 | 166.00 |

The feature value calculations use columns on the current row, combined with preceding row columns within the range.

### Tumbling window aggregation

A tumbling window can aggregate data on time-series data. Group the data into fixed-size, nonoverlapping and continuous time windows, and then aggregate it. For example, users can define features based on daily or hourly aggregation. Use the `pyspark.sql.functions.window` function to define a tumbling window, for consistent results. The output feature `timestamp` should align with the end of each tumbling window.

Start with this source data:

| `user_id` | `timestamp` | `spend` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2022-12-10 06:00:00 | 12.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-10 16:00:00 | 10.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-10 03:00:00 | 56.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 01:00:00 | 10.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-12 04:00:00 | 23.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-12 12:00:00 | 10.00 |

Define a new feature set named `user_daily_spend`:

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.ml import Transformer
from pyspark.sql.dataframe import DataFrame

class TransactionFeatureTransformer(Transformer):
    def _transform(self, df: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
        df1 = df.groupBy("user_id", F.window("timestamp", windowDuration="1 day",slideDuration="1 day"))\
                .agg(F.sum("spend").alias("daily_spend"))
        df2 = df1.select("user_id", df1.window.end.cast("timestamp").alias("end"),"daily_spend")
        df3 = df2.withColumn('timestamp', F.expr("end - INTERVAL 1 milliseconds")) \
              .select("user_id", "timestamp","daily_spend")
        return df3
```

The `user_daily_spend` feature set has this feature:

- `daily_spend`: double

This shows its calculated feature values:

| `user_id` | `timestamp` | `daily_spend` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2022-12-10 23:59:59 | 22.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-10 23:59:59 | 56.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 23:59:59 | 10.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-12 23:59:59 | 33.00 |

### Stagger window aggregation

Stagger window aggregation is a minor variant of the tumbling window aggregation. Stagger window aggregation groups the data into fixed-size windows. However, the windows can overlap each other. For this, use `pyspark.sql.functions.window`, with a `slideDuration` smaller than `windowDuration`.

Start with this example data:

| `user_id` | `timestamp` | `spend` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2022-12-10 03:00:00 | 12.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-10 09:00:00 | 10.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 05:00:00 | 8.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-12 14:00:00 | 56.00 |

Define a new feature set named `user_sliding_24hr_spend`:

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.ml import Transformer
from pyspark.sql.dataframe import DataFrame

class TrsactionFeatureTransformer(Transformer):
    def _transform(self, df: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
        df1 = df.groupBy("user_id", F.window("timestamp", windowDuration="1 day",slideDuration="6 hours"))\
                .agg(F.sum("spend").alias("sliding_24hr_spend"))
        df2 = df1.select("user_id", df1.window.end.cast("timestamp").alias("end"),"sliding_24hr_spend")
        df3 = df2.withColumn('timestamp', F.expr("end - INTERVAL 1 milliseconds")) \
              .select("user_id", "timestamp","sliding_24hr_spend")
        return df3
```

The `user_sliding_24hr_spend` feature set has one feature:

- `sliding_24hr_spend`: double

This shows its calculated feature values:

| `user_id` | `timestamp` | `sliding_24hr_spend` |
|---|---------------------|---|
| 1 | 2022-12-10 05:59:59 | 12.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-10 11:59:59 | 22.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-10 17:59:59 | 22.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-10 23:59:59 | 22.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 05:59:59 | 18.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 11:59:59 | 8.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 17:59:59 | 8.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-11 23:59:59 | 8.00 |
| 1 | 2022-12-12 05:59:59 | 18.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-12 17:59:59 | 56.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-12 23:59:59 | 56.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-13 05:59:59 | 56.00 |
| 2 | 2022-12-13 11:59:59 | 56.00 |

## Define feature transformations - best practices

### Prevent data leakage in feature transformation

If the timestamp value for each calculated feature value is `ts_0`, calculate the feature values based on `source` data with timestamp values on or before `ts_0` only. This avoids feature calculation based on data from after the feature event time, otherwise known as *data leakage*.

Data leakage usually happens with sliding/tumbling/stagger window aggregation. These best practices can help avoid leakage:

- Sliding window aggregation: define the window to look only back in time, from each row
- Tumbling/stagger window aggregation: define the feature timestamp based on the end of each window

This data sample shows good and bad example data:

| Aggregation | Good example | Bad example with data leakage |
|---|---|---|
|Sliding window | Window.partitionBy("user_id")<br>.orderBy(F.col("timestamp").cast('long'))<br>.`rangeBetween(-days(4), 0)` | Window.partitionBy("user_id")<br>.orderBy(F.col("timestamp").cast('long'))<br>.`rangeBetween(-days(2), days(2))` |
|Tumbling/stagger window | df1 = df.groupBy("user_id", F.window("timestamp", windowDuration="1 day",slideDuration="1 day"))<br>.agg(F.sum("spend").alias("daily_spend"))<br><br>df2 = df1.select("user_id", df1.window.`end`.cast("timestamp").alias("timestamp"),"daily_spend") | df1 = df.groupBy("user_id", F.window("timestamp", windowDuration="1 day",slideDuration="1 day"))<br>.agg(F.sum("spend").alias("daily_spend"))<br><br>df2 = df1.select("user_id", df1.window.`start`.cast("timestamp").alias("timestamp"),"daily_spend")  |

Data leakage in the feature transformation definition can lead to these problems:

- Errors in the calculated/materialized feature values
- Inconsistencies in `get_offline_feature`, when using the materialized feature value instead of values calculated on the fly

### Set proper `source_lookback`

For time-series (sliding/tumbling/stagger window aggregation) data aggregations, set the `source_lookback` property correctly. This diagram shows the relationship between the source data window and the feature window in the feature (set) calculation:

:::image type="content" source="./media/feature-set-specification-transformation-concepts/illustration-source-lookback.png" lightbox="./media/feature-set-specification-transformation-concepts/illustration-source-lookback.png" alt-text="Illustration showing the concept of source_lookback.":::

Define `source_lookback` as a time delta value, which presents the range of source data needed for a feature value of a given timestamp. This example shows the recommended `source_lookback` values for the common transformation types:

| Transformation type | `source_lookback` |
|---|---|
| Row-level transformation | 0 (default) |
| Sliding window | size of the largest window range in the transformer.<br> e.g.<br> `source_lookback` = 3 days when the feature set defines three day rolling features <br> `source_lookback` = 7 days when the feature set defines both three day and seven day rolling features |
| Tumbling/stagger window | value of `windowDuration` in `window` definition. e.g. source_lookback = 1day when using `window("timestamp", windowDuration="1 day",slideDuration="6 hours)` |

Incorrect `source_lookback` settings can lead to incorrect calculated/materialized feature values.
