# Schedule data import jobs (preview)

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

In this article, you'll learn how to programmatically schedule data imports, using the schedule UI to do it. You can create a schedule based on elapsed time. Time-based schedules can handle routine tasks - for example, regular data imports to keep them up-to-date. After learning how to create schedules, you'll learn how to retrieve, update and deactivate them via CLI, SDK, and studio UI resources.

## Prerequisites

- You need an Azure subscription to use Azure Machine Learning. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) today.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

- Install the Azure CLI and the `ml` extension. Follow the installation steps in [Install, set up, and use the CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md).

- Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace if you don't have one. For workspace creation, see [Install, set up, and use the CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md).

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

- Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace if you don't have one.
- The [Azure Machine Learning SDK v2 for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-ml-readme).

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace. See [Create workspace resources](quickstart-create-resources.md).
- Understanding of Azure Machine Learning pipelines. See [what are machine learning pipelines](concept-ml-pipelines.md), and how to create pipeline job in [CLI v2](how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli.md) or [SDK v2](how-to-create-component-pipeline-python.md).

## Schedule data import

To import data on a recurring basis, you must create a schedule. A `Schedule` associates a data import action with a trigger. The trigger can either be `cron`, which uses a cron expression to describe the delay between runs, or a `recurrence`, which specifies the frequency to trigger a job. In each case, you must first build an import data definition. An existing data import, or a data import that is defined inline, works for this. For more information, visit [Create a data import in CLI, SDK and UI](how-to-import-data-assets.md).

## Create a schedule

### Create a time-based schedule with recurrence pattern

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

[!INCLUDE [CLI v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

#### YAML: Schedule for data import with recurrence pattern
```yml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/schedule.schema.json
name: simple_recurrence_import_schedule
display_name: Simple recurrence import schedule
description: a simple hourly recurrence import schedule

trigger:
  type: recurrence
  frequency: day #can be minute, hour, day, week, month
  interval: 1 #every day
  schedule:
    hours: [4,5,10,11,12]
    minutes: [0,30]
  start_time: "2022-07-10T10:00:00" # optional - default will be schedule creation time
  time_zone: "Pacific Standard Time" # optional - default will be UTC

ml_client.schedules.begin_create_or_update(import_schedule).result()

```
`RecurrenceTrigger` contains following properties:

- **(Required)** For a better coding experience, use `RecurrenceTrigger` for the recurrence schedule.

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

When your data import has satisfactory performance and outputs, you can set up a schedule to automatically trigger that import.

   1. Navigate to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com)

   1. Under **Assets** in the left navigation, select **Data**. At the **Data import** tab, select the imported data asset to which you want to attach a schedule. The **Import jobs history** page should appear, as shown in this screenshot:

   1. The *Basic settings* of the schedule creation wizard have the properties shown in this screenshot:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-data-import/create-schedule-basic-settings.png" lightbox="./media/how-to-schedule-data-import/create-schedule-basic-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of schedule creation wizard showing the basic settings.":::

  - **Name**: the unique identifier of the schedule within the workspace.
  - **Description**: the schedule description.
  - **Trigger**: the recurrence pattern of the schedule, which includes these properties:
    - **Time zone**: the trigger time calculation is based on this time zone; (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time by default.
    - **Recurrence** or **Cron expression**: select recurrence to specify the recurring pattern. Under **Recurrence**, you can specify the recurrence frequency - by minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months.
    - **Start**: the schedule first becomes active on this date. By default, the creation date of this schedule.
    - **End**: the schedule will become inactive after this date. By default, it's NONE, which means that the schedule remains active until you manually disable it.
    - **Tags**: the selected schedule tags.

    After you configure the basic settings, you can select **Review + Create**, and the schedule will automatically submit the data import based on the recurrence pattern you specified. You can also select **Next**, and navigate through the wizard to select or update the data import parameters.

---
> [!NOTE]
> These properties apply to CLI and SDK:

- **(Required)** `frequency` specifies the unit of time that describes how often the schedule fires. Can have values
  - `minute`
  - `hour`
  - `day`
  - `week`
  - `month`

- **(Required)** `interval` specifies how often the schedule fires based on the frequency, which is the number of time units to wait until the schedule fires again.

- (Optional) `schedule` defines the recurrence pattern, containing `hours`, `minutes`, and `weekdays`.
    - When `frequency` equals `day`, a pattern can specify `hours` and `minutes`.
    - When `frequency` equals `week` and `month`, a pattern can specify `hours`, `minutes` and `weekdays`.
    - `hours` should be an integer or a list, ranging between 0 and 23.
    - `minutes` should be an integer or a list, ranging between 0 and 59.
    - `weekdays` a string or list ranging from `monday` to `sunday`.
    - If `schedule` is omitted, the job(s) triggers fire according to the logic of `start_time`, `frequency` and `interval`.

- (Optional) `start_time` describes the start date and time, with a timezone. If `start_time` is omitted, start_time equals the job creation time. For a start time in the past, the first job runs at the next calculated run time.

- (Optional) `end_time` describes the end date and time with a timezone. If `end_time` is omitted, the schedule continues to trigger jobs until the schedule is manually disabled.

- (Optional) `time_zone` specifies the time zone of the recurrence. If omitted, the default timezone is UTC. For more information about timezone values, visit [appendix for timezone values](reference-yaml-schedule.md#appendix).

- **(Required)** `expression` uses a standard crontab expression to express a recurring schedule. A single expression is composed of five space-delimited fields:

    `MINUTES HOURS DAYS MONTHS DAYS-OF-WEEK`

    - A single wildcard (`*`), which covers all values for the field. A `*`, in days, means all days of a month (which varies with month and year).
    - The `expression: "15 16 * * 1"` in the sample above means the 16:15PM on every Monday.
    - This table lists the valid values for each field:

        | Field          |   Range  | Comment                                                   |
        |----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
        | `MINUTES`      |    0-59  | -                                                         |
        | `HOURS`        |    0-23  | -                                                         |
        | `DAYS`         |    -  |    Not supported. The value is ignored and treated as `*`.    |
        | `MONTHS`       |    -  | Not supported. The value is ignored and treated as `*`.        |
        | `DAYS-OF-WEEK` |    0-6   | Zero (0) means Sunday. Names of days also accepted. |

    - For more information about crontab expressions, visit the [Crontab Expression wiki resource on GitHub](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab/wiki/Crontab-Expression).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > `DAYS` and `MONTH` are not supported. If you pass one of these values, it will be ignored and treated as `*`.

- (Optional) `start_time` specifies the start date and time with the timezone of the schedule. For example, `start_time: "2022-05-10T10:15:00-04:00"` means the schedule starts from 10:15:00AM on 2022-05-10 in the UTC-4 timezone. If `start_time` is omitted, the `start_time` equals the schedule creation time. For a start time in the past, the first job runs at the next calculated run time.

- (Optional) `end_time` describes the end date, and time with a timezone. If `end_time` is omitted, the schedule continues to trigger jobs until the schedule is manually disabled.

- (Optional) `time_zone`specifies the time zone of the expression. If `time_zone` is omitted, the timezone is UTC by default.  For more information about timezone values, visit [appendix for timezone values](reference-yaml-schedule.md#appendix).

Limitations:

- Currently, Azure Machine Learning v2 scheduling doesn't support event-based triggers.
- Use the Azure Machine Learning SDK/CLI v2 to specify a complex recurrence pattern that contains multiple trigger timestamps. The UI only displays the complex pattern and doesn't support editing.
- If you set the recurrence as the 31st day of every month, the schedule won't trigger jobs in months with less than 31 days.

## RBAC (Role-based-access-control) support

Schedules are generally used for production. To prevent problems, workspace admins may want to restrict schedule creation and management permissions within a workspace.

There are currently three action rules related to schedules, and you can configure them in the Azure portal. For more information, visit [how to manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace.](how-to-assign-roles.md#create-custom-role).
