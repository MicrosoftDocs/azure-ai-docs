# Tutorial: Forecast demand with no-code automated machine learning in the Azure Machine Learning studio

Learn how to create a [time-series forecasting model](concept-automated-ml.md#time-series-forecasting) without writing a single line of code using automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning studio. This model predicts rental demand for a bike sharing service.  

You don't write any code in this tutorial. Instead, you use the studio interface to perform training. You learn how to do the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and load a dataset.
> * Configure and run an automated ML experiment.
> * Specify forecasting settings.
> * Explore the experiment results.
> * Deploy the best model.

Also try automated machine learning for other model types:

* For a no-code example of a classification model, see [Tutorial: Create a classification model with automated ML in Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md).
* For a code-first example of an object detection model, see [Tutorial: Train an object detection model with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).

    1. Select **Next** to continue to the **Review** page. Review the summary of your configuration settings for the job.


## Run experiment

To run your experiment, select **Submit training job**. The **Job details** screen opens with the **Job status** at the top next to the job number. This status updates as the experiment progresses. Notifications also appear in the top right corner of the studio to inform you of the status of your experiment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Preparation takes **10-15 minutes** to prepare the experiment job.
> Once running, it takes **2-3 minutes more for each iteration**.<br><br>
> In production, you'd likely walk away for a bit as this process takes time. While you wait, we suggest you start exploring the tested algorithms on the **Models** tab as they complete. 

##  Explore models

Navigate to the **Models + child jobs** tab to see the algorithms (models) tested. By default, the models are ordered by metric score as they complete. For this tutorial, the model that scores the highest based on the chosen **Normalized root mean squared error** metric appears at the top of the list.

While you wait for all of the experiment models to finish, select the **Algorithm name** of a completed model to explore its performance details. 

The following example navigates to select a model from the list of models that the job created. Then, you select the **Overview** and **Metrics** tabs to view the selected model's properties, metrics, and performance charts.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-automated-ml-forecast/explore-models.gif" alt-text="Screenshot of navigating through model exploration interface showing Overview and Metrics tabs for viewing model properties and performance charts.":::

## Deploy the model

Automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning studio allows you to deploy the best model as a web service in a few steps. Deployment is the integration of the model so it can predict on new data and identify potential areas of opportunity. 

For this experiment, deployment to a web service means that the bike share company now has an iterative and scalable web solution for forecasting bike share rental demand. 

Once the job is complete, navigate back to the parent job page by selecting **Job 1** at the top of your screen.

In the **Best model summary** section, the best model in the context of this experiment is selected based on the **Normalized root mean squared error** metric. 

We deploy this model, but be advised that deployment takes about 20 minutes to complete. The deployment process entails several steps including registering the model, generating resources, and configuring them for the web service.

1. Select **the best model** to open the model-specific page.

1. Select the **Deploy** button in the top-left area of the screen.

1. Populate the **Deploy a model** pane as follows:

    | Field | Value |
    |----|-----|
    | Deployment name | bikeshare-deploy |
    | Deployment description | bike share demand deployment |
    | Compute type | Select Azure Compute Instance (ACI) |
    | Enable authentication | Disable |
    | Use custom deployment assets | Disable. Disabling allows for the default driver file (scoring script) and environment file to be autogenerated. | 
    
    For this example, we use the defaults provided in the **Advanced** menu. 

1. Select **Deploy**.  

    A green success message appears at the top of the **Job** screen stating that the deployment was started successfully. The progress of the deployment can be found in the **Model summary** pane under **Deploy status**.
    
Once deployment succeeds, you have an operational web service to generate predictions. 

Proceed to the [**Next steps**](#next-steps) to learn more about how to consume your new web service and test your predictions using Power BI's built-in Azure Machine Learning support.

## Clean up resources

Deployment files are larger than data and experiment files, so they cost more to store. Delete only the deployment files to minimize costs to your account, or if you want to keep your workspace and experiment files. Otherwise, delete the entire resource group if you don't plan to use any of the files.  

### Delete the deployment instance

Delete just the deployment instance from Azure Machine Learning studio if you want to keep the resource group and workspace for other tutorials and exploration. 

1. Go to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/). Navigate to your workspace and on the left under the **Assets** pane, select **Endpoints**. 

1. Select the deployment you want to delete and select **Delete**. 

1. Select **Proceed**.

### Delete the resource group
