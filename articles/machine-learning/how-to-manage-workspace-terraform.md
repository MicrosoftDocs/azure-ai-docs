# Manage Azure Machine Learning workspaces by using Terraform

In this article, you learn how to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace by using Terraform configuration files. [Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/) template-based configuration files enable you to define, create, and configure Azure resources in a repeatable and predictable manner. Terraform tracks resource state and can clean up and destroy resources.

A Terraform configuration file is a document that defines the resources needed for a deployment. The Terraform configuration can also specify deployment variables to use to provide input values when you apply the configuration.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with a free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account before you begin](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- Terraform installed and configured according to the instructions in [Quickstart: Install and configure Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure).
<!--- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed.-->

## Limitations

[!INCLUDE [register-namespace](includes/machine-learning-register-namespace.md)]

- The following limitation applies to the Application Insights instance created during workspace creation:

  [!INCLUDE [application-insight](includes/machine-learning-application-insight.md)]

## Create the workspace

Create a file named *main.tf* that has the following code.

:::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/101-machine-learning/main.tf":::

Declare the Azure provider in a file named *providers.tf* that has the following code.

:::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/101-machine-learning/providers.tf":::

### Configure the workspace

To create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, use one of the following Terraform configurations. An Azure Machine Learning workspace requires various other services as dependencies. The template specifies these [associated resources](./concept-workspace.md#associated-resources). Depending on your needs, you can choose to use a template that creates resources with either public or private network connectivity.

> [!NOTE]
> Some resources in Azure require globally unique names. Before deploying your resources, make sure to set `name` variables to unique values.

# [Public network](#tab/publicworkspace)

The following configuration creates a workspace with public network connectivity.

Define the following variables in a file called *variables.tf*.

:::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/101-machine-learning/variables.tf":::

Define the following workspace configuration in a file called *workspace.tf*:

:::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/101-machine-learning/workspace.tf":::

# [Private network](#tab/privateworkspace)

The following configuration creates a workspace in an isolated network environment by using Azure Private Link endpoints. The template includes [private Domain Name System (DNS) zones](/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone) to resolve domain names within the virtual network.

If you use private link endpoints for both Azure Container Registry and Azure Machine Learning, you can't use Container Registry tasks for building [environment](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.environment) images. Instead you must build images by using an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster.

To configure the cluster name to use, set the [image_build_compute_name](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/machine_learning_workspace) argument. You can also [allow public access](./how-to-configure-private-link.md?tabs=python#enable-public-access) to a workspace that has a private link endpoint by using the [public_network_access_enabled](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/machine_learning_workspace) argument.

Define the following variables in a file called *variables.tf*.

:::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/201-machine-learning-moderately-secure/variables.tf":::

Define the following workspace configuration in a file called *workspace.tf*:

:::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/201-machine-learning-moderately-secure/workspace.tf":::

Define the following network configuration in a file called *network.tf*:

```terraform
# Virtual network
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "default" {
  name                = "vnet-${var.name}-${var.environment}"
  address_space       = var.vnet_address_space
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.default.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "snet-training" {
  name                                           = "snet-training"
  resource_group_name                            = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
  virtual_network_name                           = azurerm_virtual_network.default.name
  address_prefixes                               = var.training_subnet_address_space
  enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies = true
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "snet-aks" {
  name                                           = "snet-aks"
  resource_group_name                            = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
  virtual_network_name                           = azurerm_virtual_network.default.name
  address_prefixes                               = var.aks_subnet_address_space
  enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies = true
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "snet-workspace" {
  name                                           = "snet-workspace"
  resource_group_name                            = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
  virtual_network_name                           = azurerm_virtual_network.default.name
  address_prefixes                               = var.ml_subnet_address_space
  enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies = true
}

## Create and apply the plan

To create the workspace, run the following code:

```terraform
terraform init

terraform plan \
        # -var <any of the variables set in variables.tf> \
          -out demo.tfplan

terraform apply "demo.tfplan"
```
