# Tutorial: How to create a secure workspace with an Azure Virtual Network

In this article, learn how to create and connect to a secure Azure Machine Learning workspace. The steps in this article use an Azure Virtual Network to create a security boundary around resources used by Azure Machine Learning. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend using the Azure Machine Learning managed virtual network instead of an Azure Virtual Network. For a version of this tutorial that uses a managed virtual network, see [Tutorial: Create a secure workspace with a managed virtual network](tutorial-create-secure-workspace.md).

In this tutorial, you accomplish the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to __secure communications between services in the virtual network__.
> * Create an Azure Storage Account (blob and file) behind the VNet. This service is used as __default storage for the workspace__.
> * Create an Azure Key Vault behind the VNet. This service is used to __store secrets used by the workspace__. For example, the security information needed to access the storage account.
> * Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR). This service is used as a repository for Docker images. __Docker images provide the compute environments needed when training a machine learning model or deploying a trained model as an endpoint__.
> * Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
> * Create a jump box. A jump box is an Azure Virtual Machine that is behind the VNet. Since the VNet restricts access from the public internet, __the jump box is used as a way to connect to resources behind the VNet__.
> * Configure Azure Machine Learning studio to work behind a VNet. The studio provides a __web interface for Azure Machine Learning__.
> * Create an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster. A compute cluster is used when __training machine learning models in the cloud__. In configurations where Azure Container Registry is behind the VNet, it is also used to build Docker images.
> * Connect to the jump box and use the Azure Machine Learning studio.

> [!TIP]
> If you're looking for a template that demonstrates how to create a secure workspace, see [Bicep template](/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/machine-learning-end-to-end-secure/), or [Terraform template](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/201-machine-learning-moderately-secure).

After completing this tutorial, you'll have the following architecture:

* An Azure Virtual Network, which contains three subnets:
    * __Training__: Contains the Azure Machine Learning workspace, dependency services, and resources used for training models.
    * __Scoring__: For the steps in this tutorial, it isn't used. However if you continue using this workspace for other tutorials, we recommend using this subnet when deploying models to [endpoints](concept-endpoints.md).
    * __AzureBastionSubnet__: Used by the Azure Bastion service to securely connect clients to Azure Virtual Machines.
* An Azure Machine Learning workspace that uses a private endpoint to communicate using the virtual network.
* An Azure Storage Account that uses private endpoints to allow storage services such as blob and file to communicate using the virtual network.
* An Azure Container Registry that uses a private endpoint communicate using the virtual network.
* Azure Bastion, which allows you to use your browser to securely communicate with the jump box VM inside the virtual network.
* An Azure Virtual Machine that you can remotely connect to and access resources secured inside the virtual network.
* An Azure Machine Learning compute instance and compute cluster.

> [!TIP]
> The Azure Batch Service listed on the diagram is a back-end service required by the compute clusters and compute instances.

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Azure Virtual Networks and IP networking. If you aren't familiar, try the [Fundamentals of computer networking](/training/modules/network-fundamentals/) module.
* While most of the steps in this article use the Azure portal or the Azure Machine Learning studio, some steps use the Azure CLI extension for Machine Learning v2.

## Create a virtual network

To create a virtual network, use the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the portal menu in the upper left corner. From the menu, select __+ Create a resource__ and then enter __Virtual Network__ in the search field. Select the __Virtual Network__ entry, and then select __Create__.


    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/create-resource-search-vnet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the resource search form with virtual network selected.":::

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/create-resource-vnet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the virtual network create form.":::

1. From the __Basics__ tab, select the Azure __subscription__ to use for this resource and then select or create a new __resource group__. Under __Instance details__, enter a friendly __name__ for your virtual network and select the __region__ to create it in.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/create-vnet-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the basic virtual network configuration form.":::

1. Select __Security__. Select to __Enable Azure Bastion__. [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) provides a secure way to access the VM jump box you create inside the virtual network in a later step. Use the following values for the remaining fields:

    * __Bastion name__: A unique name for this Bastion instance
    * __Public IP address__: Create a new public IP address.

    Leave the other fields at the default values.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/create-bastion.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Bastion config.":::

1. Select __IP Addresses__. The default settings should be similar to the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/create-vnet-ip-address-default.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the default IP Address form.":::

    Use the following steps to configure the IP address and configure a subnet for training and scoring resources:

    > [!TIP]
    > While you can use a single subnet for all Azure Machine Learning resources, the steps in this article show how to create two subnets to separate the training & scoring resources.
    >
    > The workspace and other dependency services will go into the training subnet. They can still be used by resources in other subnets, such as the scoring subnet.

    1. Look at the default __IPv4 address space__ value. In the screenshot, the value is __172.16.0.0/16__. __The value may be different for you__. While you can use a different value, the rest of the steps in this tutorial are based on the __172.16.0.0/16 value__.
    
        > [!WARNING]
        > Do not use the 172.17.0.0/16 IP address range for your VNet. This is the default subnet range used by the Docker bridge network, and will result in errors if used for your VNet. Other ranges may also conflict depending on what you want to connect to the virtual network. For example, if you plan to connect your on premises network to the VNet, and your on-premises network also uses the 172.16.0.0/16 range. Ultimately, it is up to __you__ to plan your network infrastructure.

    1. Select the __Default__ subnet and then select the __edit icon__.
    
        :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/edit-default-subnet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the edit icon of default subnet.":::

    1. Change the subnet __Name__ to __Training__. Leave the other values at the default settings, then select __Save__ to save the changes.

    1. To create a subnet for compute resources used to _score_ your models, select __+ Add subnet__ and set the name and address range:
        * __Subnet name__: Scoring
        * __Starting address__: 172.16.2.0
        * __Subnet size__: /24 (256 addresses)

        :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/vnet-add-scoring-subnet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Scoring subnet.":::

    1. Select __Add__ to add the subnet.

## Connect to the workspace

There are several ways that you can connect to the secured workspace. The steps in this article use a __jump box__, which is a virtual machine in the virtual network. You can connect to it using your web browser and Azure Bastion. The following table lists several other ways that you might connect to the secure workspace:

| Method | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| [Azure VPN gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) | Connects on-premises networks to the virtual network over a private connection. Connection is made over the public internet. |
| [ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute/) | Connects on-premises networks into the cloud over a private connection. Connection is made using a connectivity provider. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using a __VPN gateway__ or __ExpressRoute__, you will need to plan how name resolution works between your on-premises resources and those in the VNet. For more information, see [Use a custom DNS server](how-to-custom-dns.md).

### Create a jump box (VM)

Use the following steps to create an Azure Virtual Machine to use as a jump box. Azure Bastion enables you to connect to the VM desktop through your browser. From the VM desktop, you can then use the browser on the VM to connect to resources inside the virtual network, such as Azure Machine Learning studio. Or you can install development tools on the VM. 

> [!TIP]
> The following steps create a Windows 11 enterprise VM. Depending on your requirements, you may want to select a different VM image. The Windows 11 (or 10) enterprise image is useful if you need to join the VM to your organization's domain.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the portal menu in the upper left corner. From the menu, select __+ Create a resource__ and then enter __Virtual Machine__. Select the __Virtual Machine__ entry, and then select __Create__.

1. From the __Basics__ tab, select the __subscription__, __resource group__, and __Region__ you previously used for the virtual network. Provide values for the following fields:

    * __Virtual machine name__: A unique name for the VM.
    * __Username__: The username you use to sign in to the VM.
    * __Password__: The password for the username.
    * __Security type__: Standard.
    * __Image__: Windows 11 Enterprise.

        > [!TIP]
        > If Windows 11 Enterprise isn't in the list for image selection, use _See all images__. Find the __Windows 11__ entry from Microsoft, and use the __Select__ drop-down to select the enterprise image.


    You can leave other fields at the default values.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/create-virtual-machine-basic.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the virtual machine basics configuration.":::

1. Select __Networking__, and then select the __Virtual network__ you created earlier. Use the following information to set the remaining fields:

    * Select the __Training__ subnet.
    * Set the __Public IP__ to __None__.
    * Leave the other fields at the default value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/create-virtual-machine-network.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the virtual machine network configuration.":::

1. Select __Review + create__. Verify that the information is correct, and then select __Create__.


### Connect to the jump box

1. Once the virtual machine is created, select __Go to resource__.
1. From the top of the page, select __Connect__ and then __Connect via Bastion__.

    > [!TIP]
    > Azure Bastion uses port 443 for inbound communication. If you have a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, ensure that it allows traffic on port 443 to the Azure Bastion service. For more information, see [Wroking with NSGs and Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-nsg).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/virtual-machine-connect.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'connect' list, with 'Bastion' selected.":::

1. Provide your authentication information for the virtual machine, and a connection is established in your browser.

## Create a compute cluster and instance

A compute instance provides a Jupyter Notebook experience on a shared compute resource attached to your workspace.

1. From an Azure Bastion connection to the jump box, open the __Microsoft Edge__ browser on the remote desktop.
1. In the remote browser session, go to __https://ml.azure.com__. When prompted, authenticate using your Microsoft Entra account.

For more information on creating a compute cluster and compute cluster, including how to do so with Python and the CLI, see the following articles:

* [Create a compute cluster](how-to-create-attach-compute-cluster.md)
* [Create a compute instance](how-to-create-compute-instance.md)

## Configure image builds

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

When Azure Container Registry is behind the virtual network, Azure Machine Learning can't use it to directly build Docker images (used for training and deployment). Instead, configure the workspace to use the compute cluster you created earlier. Use the following steps to create a compute cluster and configure the workspace to use it to build images:

1. Navigate to [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/) to open the Azure Cloud Shell.
1. From the Cloud Shell, use the following command to install the 2.0 CLI for Azure Machine Learning:
 
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension add -n ml
    ```

1. To update the workspace to use the compute cluster to build Docker images. Replace `docs-ml-rg` with your resource group. Replace `docs-ml-ws` with your workspace. Replace `cpu-cluster` with the compute cluster name:
    
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml workspace update \
      -n docs-ml-ws \
      -g docs-ml-rg \
      -i cpu-cluster
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use the same compute cluster to train models and build Docker images for the workspace.

## Use the workspace

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The steps in this article put Azure Container Registry behind the VNet. In this configuration, you cannot deploy a model to Azure Container Instances inside the VNet. We do not recommend using Azure Container Instances with Azure Machine Learning in a virtual network. For more information, see [Secure the inference environment (SDK/CLI v1)](./v1/how-to-secure-inferencing-vnet.md).
>
> As an alternative to Azure Container Instances, try Azure Machine Learning managed online endpoints. For more information, see [Enable network isolation for managed online endpoints](how-to-secure-online-endpoint.md).

At this point, you can use the studio to interactively work with notebooks on the compute instance and run training jobs on the compute cluster. For a tutorial on using the compute instance and compute cluster, see [Tutorial: Azure Machine Learning in a day](tutorial-azure-ml-in-a-day.md).

## Stop compute instance and jump box

> [!WARNING]
> While it is running (started), the compute instance and jump box will continue charging your subscription. To avoid excess cost, __stop__ them when they are not in use.

The compute cluster dynamically scales between the minimum and maximum node count set when you created it. If you accepted the defaults, the minimum is 0, which effectively turns off the cluster when not in use.
### Stop the compute instance

From studio, select __Compute__, __Compute clusters__, and then select the compute instance. Finally, select __Stop__ from the top of the page.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/compute-instance-stop.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the stop button for the compute instance.":::

### Stop the jump box

Once created, select the virtual machine in the Azure portal and then use the __Stop__ button. When you're ready to use it again, use the __Start__ button to start it.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/virtual-machine-stop.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the stop button for the jump box virtual machine.":::

You can also configure the jump box to automatically shut down at a specific time. To do so, select __Auto-shutdown__, __Enable__, set a time, and then select __Save__.

## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue using the secured workspace and other resources, skip this section.

To delete all resources created in this tutorial, use the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select __Resource groups__ on the far left.
1. From the list, select the resource group that you created in this tutorial.
1. Select __Delete resource group__.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secure-workspace-vnet/delete-resources.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the delete resource group link.":::

1. Enter the resource group name, then select __Delete__.
