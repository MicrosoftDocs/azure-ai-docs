# Set up no-code Automated ML training for tabular data with the studio UI 

In this article, you set up automated machine learning training jobs by using Azure Machine Learning Automated ML in [Azure Machine Learning studio](overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md#studio). This approach lets you set up the job without writing a single line of code. Automated ML is a process where Azure Machine Learning selects the best machine learning algorithm for your specific data. The process enables you to generate machine learning models quickly. For more information, see the [Overview of the Automated ML process](concept-automated-ml.md).

This tutorial provides a high-level overview for working with Automated ML in the studio. The following articles provide detailed instructions for working with specific machine learning models: 
- **Classification**: [Tutorial: Train a classification model with Automated ML in the studio](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md)
- **Time series forecasting**: [Tutorial: Forecast demand with Automated ML in the studio](tutorial-automated-ml-forecast.md)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: [Set up Automated ML to train an NLP model (Azure CLI or Python SDK)](how-to-auto-train-nlp-models.md)
- **Computer vision**: [Set up AutoML to train computer vision models (Azure CLI or Python SDK)](how-to-auto-train-image-models.md)
- **Regression**: [Train a regression model with Automated ML (Python SDK)](./v1/how-to-auto-train-models-v1.md)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. You can create a [free or paid account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) for Azure Machine Learning.

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace or compute instance. To prepare these resources, see [Quickstart: Get started with Azure Machine Learning](quickstart-create-resources.md).

- The data asset to use for the Automated ML training job. This tutorial describes how to select an existing data asset or create a data asset from a data source, such as a local file, web url, or datastore. For more information, see [Create and manage data assets](how-to-create-data-assets.md).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > There are two requirements for the training data:
   > - The data must be in tabular form.
   > - The value to predict (the _target_ column) must be present in the data.

<a name="customize-featurization"></a>

#### Configure featurization settings

You can select the **View featurization settings** option to see actions to perform on the data in preparation for training. 

The **Featurization** page shows default featurization techniques for your data columns. You can enable/disable automatic featurization and customize the automatic featurization settings for your experiment. 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/view-featurization.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Select task type dialog box with View featurization settings called out." lightbox="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/view-featurization.png":::

1. Select the **Enable featurization** option to allow configuration.
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > When your data contains non-numeric columns, featurization is always enabled. 

1. Configure each available column, as desired. The following table summarizes the customizations currently available via the studio. 

   | Column | Customization |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Feature type** | Change the value type for the selected column. |
   | **Impute with**  | Select what value to impute missing values with in your data. |

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/updated-featurization.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows custom featurization in the Azure Machine Learning studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/updated-featurization.png":::

The featurization settings don't affect the input data needed for inferencing. If you exclude columns from training, the excluded columns are still required as input for inferencing on the model. 

#### Configure limits for the job

The **Limits** section provides configuration options for the following settings:

| Setting | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Max trials**                   | Specify the maximum number of trials to try during the Automated ML job, where each trial has a different combination of algorithm and hyperparameters. | Integer between 1 and 1,000 |
| **Max concurrent trials**        | Specify the maximum number of trial jobs that can be executed in parallel. | Integer between 1 and 1,000 |
| **Max nodes**                    | Specify the maximum number of nodes this job can use from the selected compute target. | 1 or more, depending on the compute configuration |
| **Metric score threshold**       | Enter the iteration metric threshold value. When the iteration reaches the threshold, the training job terminates. Keep in mind that meaningful models have a correlation greater than zero. Otherwise, the result is the same as guessing. | Average metric threshold, between bounds [0, 10] |
| **Experiment timeout (minutes)** | Specify the maximum time the entire experiment can run. After the experiment reaches the limit, the system cancels the Automated ML job, including all its trials (children jobs). | Number of minutes |
| **Iteration timeout (minutes)**  | Specify the maximum time each trial job can run. After the trial job reaches this limit, the system cancels the trial. | Number of minutes |
| **Enable early termination**     | Use this option to end the job when the score isn't improving in the short term. | Select the option to enable early end of job |

### Validate and test

The **Validate and test** section provides the following configuration options:

1. Specify the **Validation type** to use for your training job. If you don't explicitly specify either a `validation_data` or `n_cross_validations` parameter, Automated ML applies default techniques depending on the number of rows provided in the single dataset `training_data`.

   | Training data size | Validation technique |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Larger than 20,000 rows** | Train/validation data split is applied. The default is to take 10% of the initial training data set as the validation set. In turn, that validation set is used for metrics calculation. |
   | **Smaller than 20,000& rows** | Cross-validation approach is applied. The default number of folds depends on the number of rows. <br> - **Dataset with less than 1,000 rows**: 10 folds are used <br> - **Dataset with 1,000 to 20,000 rows**: Three folds are used |
    
1. Provide the **Test data** (preview) to evaluate the recommended model that Automated ML generates at the end of your experiment. When you provide test dataset, a test job is automatically triggered at the end of your experiment. This test job is the only job on the best model recommended by Automated ML. For more information, see [View remote test job results (preview)](#view-remote-test-job-results-preview).
    
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Providing a test dataset to evaluate generated models is a preview feature. This capability is an [experimental](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/#stable-vs-experimental) preview feature, and can change at any time.

   - Test data is considered separate from training and validation, and it shouldn't bias the results of the test job of the recommended model. For more information, see [Training, validation, and test data](concept-automated-ml.md#training-validation-and-test-data).

   - You can either provide your own test dataset or opt to use a percentage of your training dataset. Test data must be in the form of an [Azure Machine Learning table dataset](how-to-create-data-assets.md#create-data-assets).    

   - The schema of the test dataset should match the training dataset. The target column is optional, but if no target column is indicated, no test metrics are calculated.

   - The test dataset shouldn't be the same as the training dataset or the validation dataset.

   - **Forecasting** jobs don't support train/test split.

### Configure the compute

Follow these steps and configure the compute:

1. Select **Next** to continue to the **Compute** tab.

1. Use the **Select compute type** dropdown list to choose an option for the data profiling and training job. The options include [compute cluster](concept-compute-target.md#azure-machine-learning-compute-managed), [compute instance](concept-compute-instance.md) or [serverless](how-to-use-serverless-compute.md).

1. After you select the compute type, the other UI on the page changes based on your selection:
   
   - **Serverless**: The configuration settings display on the current page. Continue to the next step for descriptions of the settings to configure.
   
   - **Compute cluster** or **Compute instance**: Choose from the following options:
   
      - Use the **Select Automated ML compute** dropdown list to select an existing compute for your workspace, and then select **Next**. Continue to the [Run experiment and view results](#run-experiment-and-view-results) section.

      - Select **New** to create a new compute instance or cluster. This option opens the **Create compute** page. Continue to the next step for descriptions of the settings to configure.

1. For a serverless compute or a new compute, configure any required (**\***) settings:

   The configuration settings differ depending on your compute type. The following table summarizes the various settings you might need to configure:

   | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Compute name** | Enter a unique name that identifies your compute context. |
   | **Location** | Specify the region for the machine. |
   | **Virtual machine priority** | Low priority virtual machines are cheaper but don't guarantee the compute nodes. |
   | **Virtual machine type** | Select CPU or GPU for virtual machine type. |
   | **Virtual machine tier** | Select the priority for your experiment. |
   | **Virtual machine size** | Select the virtual machine size for your compute. |
   | **Min / Max nodes** | To profile data, you must specify one or more nodes. Enter the maximum number of nodes for your compute. The default is six nodes for an Azure Machine Learning Compute. |
   | **Idle seconds before scale down** | Specify the idle time before the cluster is automatically scaled down to the minimum node count. |
   | **Advanced settings** | These settings allow you to configure a user account and existing virtual network for your experiment. |
    
1. After you configure the required settings, select **Next** or **Create**, as appropriate.
   
   Creation of a new compute can take a few minutes. When creation completes, select **Next**.

## Run experiment and view results

Select **Finish** to run your experiment. The experiment preparing process can take up to 10 minutes. Training jobs can take an additional 2-3 minutes more for each pipeline to finish running. If you specified to generate RAI dashboard for the best recommended model, it can take up to 40 minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> The algorithms Automated ML employs have inherent randomness that can cause slight variation in a recommended model's final metrics score, like accuracy. Automated ML also performs operations on data such as train-test split, train-validation split or cross-validation, as necessary. If you run an experiment with the same configuration settings and primary metric multiple times, you likely see variation in each experiment's final metrics score due to these factors. 

### View experiment details

The **Job Detail** screen opens to the **Details** tab. This screen shows you a summary of the experiment job including a status bar at the top next to the job number. 

The **Models** tab contains a list of the models created ordered by the metric score. By default, the model that scores the highest based on the chosen metric is at the top of the list. As the training job tries more models, the exercised models are added to the list. Use this approach to get a quick comparison of the metrics for the models produced so far.

### View training job details

Drill down on any of the completed models for the training job details. You can see performance metric charts for specific models on the **Metrics** tab. For more information, see [Evaluate automated machine learning experiment results](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md). On this page, you can also find details on all the properties of the model along with associated code, child jobs, and images.

## View remote test job results (preview)

If you specified a test dataset or opted for a train/test split during your experiment setup on the **Validate and test** form, Automated ML automatically tests the recommended model by default. As a result, Automated ML calculates test metrics to determine the quality of the recommended model and its predictions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Testing your models with a test dataset to evaluate generated models is a preview feature. This capability is an [experimental](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/#stable-vs-experimental) preview feature, and can change at any time.
> 
> This feature isn't available for the following Automated ML scenarios:
> - [Computer vision tasks](how-to-auto-train-image-models.md)
> - [Many models and hiearchical time-series forecasting training (preview)](how-to-auto-train-forecast.md)
> - [Forecasting tasks where deep learning neural networks (DNN) are enabled](how-to-auto-train-forecast.md#enable-learning-for-deep-neural-networks)
> - [Automated ML jobs from local computes or Azure Databricks clusters](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#compute-to-run-experiment)

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/test-model-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Test model form.":::

## Responsible AI dashboard (preview)

To better understand your model, you can see various insights about your model by using the Responsible AI dashboard. This UI allows you to evaluate and debug your best Automated ML model. The Responsible AI dashboard evaluates model errors and fairness issues, diagnoses why the errors are happening by evaluating your train and/or test data, and observing model explanations. Together, these insights could help you build trust with your model and pass the audit processes. Responsible AI dashboards can't be generated for an existing Automated ML model. The dashboard is created only for the best recommended model when a new Automated ML job is created. Users should continue to use Model Explanations (preview) until support is provided for existing models. 

Generate a Responsible AI dashboard for a particular model by following these steps:

1. While you submit an Automated ML job, proceed to the **Task settings** section on the left menu and select the **View additional configuration settings** option.
   
1. On the **Additional configuration** page, select the **Explain best model** option:

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/best-model-selection-updated.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Automated ML job configuration page with Explain best model selected.":::

1. Switch to the **Compute** tab, and select the **Serverless** option for your compute:

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/compute-serverless.png" alt-text="Screenshot hat shows the Serverless compute selection.":::

1. After the operation completes, browse to the **Models** page of your Automated ML job, which contains a list of your trained models. Select the **View Responsible AI dashboard** link: 

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/view-responsible-ai.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the View dashboard page within an Automated ML job." lightbox="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/view-responsible-ai.png":::

   The Responsible AI dashboard appears for the selected model:

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/responsible-ai-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Responsible AI dashboard." lightbox="media/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models/responsible-ai-dashboard.png":::

   In the dashboard, you see four components activated for your Automated ML best model: 

   | Component | What does the component show? | How to read the chart?  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | [Error Analysis](concept-error-analysis.md) | Use error analysis when you need to: <br> - Gain a deep understanding of how model failures are distributed across a dataset and across several input and feature dimensions. <br> - Break down the aggregate performance metrics to automatically discover erroneous cohorts in order to inform your targeted mitigation steps. | [Error Analysis Charts](how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard.md) |
   | [Model Overview and Fairness](concept-fairness-ml.md) | Use this component to: <br> - Gain a deep understanding of your model performance across different cohorts of data. <br> - Understand your model fairness issues by looking at the disparity metrics. These metrics can evaluate and compare model behavior across subgroups identified in terms of sensitive (or nonsensitive) features. | [Model Overview and Fairness Charts](how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard.md#model-overview-and-fairness-metrics) |
   | [Model Explanations](how-to-machine-learning-interpretability.md) | Use the model explanation component to generate human-understandable descriptions of the predictions of a machine learning model by looking at: <br> - Global explanations: For example, what features affect the overall behavior of a loan allocation model? <br> - Local explanations: For example, why was a customer's loan application approved or rejected? | [Model Explainability Charts](how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard.md#feature-importances-model-explanations) |
   | [Data Analysis](concept-data-analysis.md) | Use data analysis when you need to: <br> - Explore your dataset statistics by selecting different filters to slice your data into different dimensions (also known as cohorts). <br> - Understand the distribution of your dataset across different cohorts and feature groups. <br> - Determine whether your findings related to fairness, error analysis, and causality (derived from other dashboard components) are a result of your dataset's distribution. <br> - Decide in which areas to collect more data to mitigate errors that come from representation issues, label noise, feature noise, label bias, and similar factors. | [Data Explorer Charts](how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard.md#data-analysis) |

1. You can further create cohorts (subgroups of data points that share specified characteristics) to focus your analysis of each component on different cohorts. The name of the cohort currently applied to the dashboard is always shown at the top left of your dashboard. The default view in your dashboard is your whole dataset, titled **All data** by default. For more information, see [Global controls](how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard.md#global-controls) for your dashboard.

## Edit and submit jobs (preview)

In scenarios where you want to create a new experiment based on the settings of an existing experiment, Automated ML provides the **Edit and submit** option in the studio UI. This functionality is limited to experiments initiated from the studio UI and requires the data schema for the new experiment to match that of the original experiment. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ability to copy, edit, and submit a new experiment based on an existing experiment is a preview feature. This capability is an [experimental](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/#stable-vs-experimental) preview feature, and can change at any time.

The **Edit and submit** option opens the **Create a new Automated ML job** wizard with the data, compute, and experiment settings prepopulated. You can configure the options on each tab in the wizard and edit selections as needed for your new experiment. 

## Deploy your model

After you have the best model, you can deploy the model as a web service to predict on new data.

> [!NOTE]
> To deploy a model generated via the `automl` package with the Python SDK, you must [register your model)](./how-to-deploy-online-endpoints.md) to the workspace. 
>
> After you register the model, you can locate the model in the studio by selecting **Models** on the left menu. On the model overview page, you can select the **Deploy** option and continue to Step 2 in this section.

Automated ML helps you deploy the model without writing code.

1. Initiate the deployment by using one of the following methods:

   - Deploy the best model with the metric criteria you defined:

      1. After the experiment completes, select **Job 1** and browse to the parent job page.

      1. Select the model listed in the **Best model summary** section, and then select **Deploy**. 

   - Deploy a specific model iteration from this experiment:

      - Select the desired model from the **Models** tab, and then select **Deploy**.

1. Populate the **Deploy model** pane:

   | Field | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Name** | Enter a unique name for your deployment. |
   | **Description** | Enter a description to better identify the deployment purpose. |
   | **Compute type** | Select the type of endpoint you want to deploy: [*Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)*](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) or [*Azure Container Instance (ACI)*](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview). |
   | **Compute name** | (Applies to AKS only) Select the name of the AKS cluster you wish to deploy to. |
   | **Enable authentication** | Select to allow for token-based or key-based authentication. |
   | **Use custom deployment assets** | Enable custom assets if you want to upload your own scoring script and environment file. Otherwise, Automated ML provides these assets for you by default. For more information, see [Deploy and score a machine learning model by using an online endpoint](how-to-deploy-online-endpoints.md). |

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > File names must be between 1 and 32 characters. The name must begin and end with alphanumerics, and can include dashes, underscores, dots, and alphanumerics between. Spaces aren't allowed.

   The **Advanced** menu offers default deployment features such as data collection and resource utilization settings. You can use the options in this menu to override these defaults. For more information, see [Monitor online endpoints](how-to-monitor-online-endpoints.md).

1. Select **Deploy**. Deployment can take about 20 minutes to complete.

   After deployment starts, the **Model summary** tab opens. You can monitor the deployment progress under the **Deploy status** section. 

Now you have an operational web service to generate predictions! You can test the predictions by querying the service from the [End-to-end AI samples in Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/data-science/use-ai-samples).
