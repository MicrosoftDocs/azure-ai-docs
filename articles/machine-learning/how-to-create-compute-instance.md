# Create an Azure Machine Learning compute instance

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

Learn how to create a [compute instance](concept-compute-instance.md) in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

Use a compute instance as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud. For development and testing, you can also use the instance as a [training compute target](concept-compute-target.md#training-compute-targets).   A compute instance can run multiple jobs in parallel and has a job queue. As a development environment, a compute instance can't be shared with other users in your workspace.

In this article, you learn how to create a compute instance.  See [Manage an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](how-to-manage-compute-instance.md) for steps to manage start, stop, restart, delete a compute instance.

You can also [use a setup script](how-to-customize-compute-instance.md) to create the compute instance with your own custom environment.

Compute instances can run jobs securely in a [virtual network environment](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md), without requiring enterprises to open up SSH ports. The job executes in a containerized environment and packages your model dependencies in a Docker container.

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses CLI v2 in some examples. If you are still using CLI v1, see [Create an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster CLI v1)](v1/how-to-create-manage-compute-instance.md?view=azureml-api-1&preserve-view=true).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure Machine Learning workspace. For more information, see [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md). In the storage account, the "Allow storage account key access" option must be enabled for compute instance creation to be successful.

Choose the tab for the environment you're using for other prerequisites.

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

* To use the Python SDK, [set up your development environment with a workspace](how-to-configure-environment.md).  Once your environment is set up, attach to the workspace in your Python script:

[!INCLUDE [connect ws v2](includes/machine-learning-connect-ws-v2.md)]

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

* If you're working on a compute instance, the CLI is already installed.  If working on a different computer, install the [Azure CLI extension for Machine Learning service (v2)](https://aka.ms/sdk-v2-install).

[!INCLUDE [set-up-cli](includes/set-up-cli.md)]


# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

* No extra prerequisites.

## Create

**Time estimate**: Approximately 5 minutes.

Creating a compute instance is a one time process for your workspace. You can reuse the compute as a development workstation or as a compute target for training. You can have multiple compute instances attached to your workspace.

The dedicated cores per region per VM family quota and total regional quota, which applies to compute instance creation, is unified and shared with Azure Machine Learning training compute cluster quota. Stopping the compute instance doesn't release quota to ensure you are able to restart the compute instance. A quota is a credit limit on Azure resources, not a capacity guarantee, Restarting a compute instance is still dependent on the available capacity of the region. If there is a capacity crunch in the region for the SKU, you may not be able to restart the compute instance.  It isn't possible to change the virtual machine size of compute instance once it's created.

The fastest way to create a compute instance is to follow the [Create resources you need to get started](quickstart-create-resources.md).

Or use the following examples to create a compute instance with more options:

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

[!notebook-python[](~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/resources/compute/compute.ipynb?name=ci_basic)]

For more information on the classes, methods, and parameters for creating a compute instance, see the following reference documents:

* [`AmlCompute` class](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.amlcompute)
* [`ComputeInstance` class](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.computeinstance). 
* [`ComputeInstanceSshSettings` class](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.computeinstancesshsettings)

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

---

You can also create a compute instance with an [Azure Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/machine-learning-compute-create-computeinstance).

## Configure idle shutdown

To avoid getting charged for a compute instance that is switched on but inactive, you can configure when to shut down your compute instance due to inactivity.

A compute instance is considered inactive if the below conditions are met:
* No active Jupyter Kernel sessions (which translates to no Notebooks usage via Jupyter, JupyterLab or Interactive notebooks)
* No active Jupyter terminal sessions
* No active Azure Machine Learning runs or experiments
* No VS Code connections; you must close your VS Code connection for your compute instance to be considered inactive. Sessions are autoterminated if VS Code detects no activity for 3 hours.
* No custom applications are running on the compute

A compute instance won't be considered idle if any custom application is running. To shutdown a compute with a custom application automatically, a schedule needs to be set up, or the custom application needs to be removed.  There are also some basic bounds around inactivity time periods; compute instance must be inactive for a minimum of 15 mins and a maximum of three days. We also don't track VS Code SSH connections to determine activity.

Also, if a compute instance has already been idle for a certain amount of time, if idle shutdown settings are updated to  an amount of time shorter than the current idle duration, the idle time clock is reset to 0. For example, if the compute instance has already been idle for 20 minutes, and the shutdown settings are updated to 15 minutes, the idle time clock is reset to 0.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the compute instance is also configured with a [managed identity](#assign-managed-identity), the compute instance won't shut down due to inactivity unless the managed identity has *contributor* access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. For more information on assigning permissions, see [Manage access to Azure Machine Learning workspaces](how-to-assign-roles.md).

The setting can be configured during compute instance creation or for existing compute instances via the following interfaces:

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

When creating a new compute instance, add the `idle_time_before_shutdown_minutes` parameter.

```Python
# Note that idle_time_before_shutdown has been deprecated.
ComputeInstance(name=ci_basic_name, size="STANDARD_DS3_v2", idle_time_before_shutdown_minutes="30")
```

You can't change the idle time of an existing compute instance with the Python SDK.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

When creating a new compute instance, add `idle_time_before_shutdown_minutes` to the YAML definition.

```YAML
# Note that this is just a snippet for the idle shutdown property. Refer to the "Create" Azure CLI section for more information.
# Note that idle_time_before_shutdown has been deprecated.
idle_time_before_shutdown_minutes: 30
```

You can't change the idle time of an existing compute instance with the CLI.

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

* When creating a new compute instance:

    1. Select **Next** to advance to **Scheduling** after completing required settings.
    1. Select **Enable idle shutdown** to enable or disable.

        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-compute-instance/enable-idle-shutdown-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Enable compute instance idle shutdown." lightbox="media/how-to-create-compute-instance/enable-idle-shutdown-preview.png":::

    1. Specify the shutdown period when enabled.

* For an existing compute instance:

    1. In the left navigation bar, select **Compute**
    1. In the list, select the compute instance you wish to change
    1. Select the **Edit** pencil in the **Schedules** section.

        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-compute-instance/edit-idle-time.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Edit idle time for a compute instance." lightbox="media/how-to-create-compute-instance/edit-idle-time.png":::

---

You can also change the idle time using:

* REST API

    Endpoint:
    ```
    POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SUB_ID}/resourceGroups/{RG_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{WS_NAME}/computes/{CI_NAME}/updateIdleShutdownSetting?api-version=2021-07-01
    ```

    Body:
    ```JSON
    {
        "idleTimeBeforeShutdown": "PT30M" // this must be a string in ISO 8601 format
    }
    ```


* ARM Templates: only configurable during new compute instance creation

    ```JSON
    // Note that this is just a snippet for the idle shutdown property in an ARM template
    {
        "idleTimeBeforeShutdown":"PT30M" // this must be a string in ISO 8601 format
    }
    ```

## Schedule automatic start and stop

Define multiple schedules for autoshutdown and autostart. For instance, create a schedule to start at 9 AM and stop at 6 PM from Monday-Thursday, and a second schedule to start at 9 AM and stop at 4 PM for Friday.  You can create a total of four schedules per compute instance.

Schedules can also be defined for [create on behalf of](#create-on-behalf-of) compute instances. You can create a schedule that creates the compute instance in a stopped state. Stopped compute instances are useful when you create a compute instance on behalf of another user.

Prior to a scheduled shutdown, users see a notification alerting them that the Compute Instance is about to shut down. At that point, the user can choose to dismiss the upcoming shutdown event. For example, if they are in the middle of using their Compute Instance.

## Create a schedule

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ComputeInstance, ComputeSchedules, ComputeStartStopSchedule, RecurrenceTrigger, RecurrencePattern
from azure.ai.ml.constants import TimeZone
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

ci_minimal_name = "ci-name"
ci_start_time = "2023-06-21T11:47:00" #specify your start time in the format yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss

rec_trigger = RecurrenceTrigger(start_time=ci_start_time, time_zone=TimeZone.INDIA_STANDARD_TIME, frequency="week", interval=1, schedule=RecurrencePattern(week_days=["Friday"], hours=15, minutes=[30]))
myschedule = ComputeStartStopSchedule(trigger=rec_trigger, action="start")
com_sch = ComputeSchedules(compute_start_stop=[myschedule])

my_compute = ComputeInstance(name=ci_minimal_name, schedules=com_sch)
ml_client.compute.begin_create_or_update(my_compute)
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

```azurecli
az ml compute create -f create-instance.yml
```

Where the file *create-instance.yml* is:

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/resources/compute/instance-schedule.yml":::

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

1. [Fill out the form](?tabs=azure-studio#create).
1. Select **Next** to advance to **Scheduling** after completing required settings.
1. Select **Add schedule** to add a new schedule.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-compute-instance/add-schedule-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Add schedule in advanced settings.":::

1. Select **Start compute instance** or **Stop compute instance**.
1. Select the **Time zone**.
1. Select the **Startup time** or **Shutdown time**.
1. Select the days when this schedule is active.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-attach-studio/stop-compute-schedule.png" alt-text="Screenshot: schedule a compute instance to shut down.":::

1. Select **Add schedule** again if you want to create another schedule.

Once the compute instance is created, you can view, edit, or add new schedules from the compute instance details section.


> [!NOTE]
> Timezone labels don't account for day light savings. For instance,  (UTC+01:00) Amsterdam, Berlin, Bern, Rome, Stockholm, Vienna is actually UTC+02:00 during day light savings.

### Create a schedule with a Resource Manager template

You can schedule the automatic start and stop of a compute instance by using a Resource Manager [template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/machine-learning-compute-create-computeinstance).

In the Resource Manager template, add:

```
"schedules": "[parameters('schedules')]"
```

Then use either cron or LogicApps expressions to define the schedule that starts or stops the instance in your parameter file:

```json
  "schedules": {
    "value": {
      "computeStartStop": [
        {
          "triggerType": "Cron",
          "cron": {
            "timeZone": "UTC",
            "expression": "0 18 * * *"
          },
          "action": "Stop",
          "status": "Enabled"
        },
        {
          "triggerType": "Cron",
          "cron": {
            "timeZone": "UTC",
            "expression": "0 8 * * *"
          },
          "action": "Start",
          "status": "Enabled"
        },
        {
          "triggerType": "Recurrence",
          "recurrence": {
            "frequency": "Day",
            "interval": 1,
            "timeZone": "UTC",
            "schedule": {
              "hours": [17],
              "minutes": [0]
            }
          },
          "action": "Stop",
          "status": "Enabled"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

* Action can have value of `Start` or `Stop`.
* For trigger type of `Recurrence` use the same syntax as logic app, with this [recurrence schema](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers#recurrence-trigger).
* For trigger type of `cron`, use standard cron syntax:

    ```cron
    // Crontab expression format: 
    // 
    // * * * * * 
    // - - - - - 
    // | | | | | 
    // | | | | +----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0) 
    // | | | +------- month (1 - 12) 
    // | | +--------- day of month (1 - 31) 
    // | +----------- hour (0 - 23) 
    // +------------- min (0 - 59) 
    // 
    // Star (*) in the value field above means all legal values as in 
    // braces for that column. The value column can have a * or a list 
    // of elements separated by commas. An element is either a number in 
    // the ranges shown above or two numbers in the range separated by a 
    // hyphen (meaning an inclusive range). 
    ```

### Azure Policy support to default a schedule

Use Azure Policy to enforce a shutdown schedule exists for every compute instance in a subscription or default to a schedule if nothing exists.
Following is a sample policy to default a shutdown schedule at 10 PM PST.
```json
{
    "mode": "All",
    "policyRule": {
     "if": {
      "allOf": [
       {
        "field": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/computeType",
        "equals": "ComputeInstance"
       },
       {
        "field": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/schedules",
        "exists": "false"
       }
      ]
     },
     "then": {
      "effect": "append",
      "details": [
       {
        "field": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/schedules",
        "value": {
         "computeStartStop": [
          {
           "triggerType": "Cron",
           "cron": {
            "startTime": "2021-03-10T21:21:07",
            "timeZone": "Pacific Standard Time",
            "expression": "0 22 * * *"
           },
           "action": "Stop",
           "status": "Enabled"
          }
         ]
        }
       }
      ]
     }
    }
}
```

## Create on behalf of

As an administrator, you can create a compute instance on behalf of a data scientist and assign the instance to them with:

* Studio, using the security settings in this article.

* [Azure Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/machine-learning-compute-create-computeinstance).  For details on how to find the TenantID and ObjectID needed in this template, see [Find identity object IDs for authentication configuration](/azure/healthcare-apis/azure-api-for-fhir/find-identity-object-ids).  You can also find these values in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

To further enhance security, when you create a compute instance on behalf of a data scientist and assign the instance to them, single sign-on (SSO) will be disabled during creation if the compute instance has a setup script or custom app.

The assigned to user needs to enable SSO on compute instance themselves after the compute is assigned to them by updating the SSO setting on the compute instance.
Assigned to user needs to have the following permission/action in their role *MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/enableSso/action*. 
Assigned to user does not need compute write (create) permission to enable SSO.

Here are the steps assigned to user needs to take. Please note creator of compute instance is not allowed to enable SSO on that compute instance due to security reasons.

1. Click on compute in left navigation pane in Azure Machine Learning studio.
1. Click on the name of compute instance where you need to enable SSO.
1. Edit the Single sign-on details section.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-compute-instance/pobo-sso-update.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows SSO can be updated on compute instance details page by the assigned to user.":::
   
1. Enable single sign-on toggle.
1. Save. Updating will take some time.

## Assign managed identity

You can assign a system- or user-assigned [managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to a compute instance, to authenticate against other Azure resources such as storage. Using managed identities for authentication helps improve workspace security and management. For example, you can allow users to access training data only when logged in to a compute instance. Or use a common user-assigned managed identity to permit access to a specific storage account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the compute instance is also configured for [idle shutdown](#configure-idle-shutdown), the compute instance won't shut down due to inactivity unless the managed identity has *contributor* access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. For more information on assigning permissions, see [Manage access to Azure Machine Learning workspaces](how-to-assign-roles.md).

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

Use SDK V2 to create a compute instance with assign system-assigned managed identity:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential
client_id = os.environ.get("DEFAULT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID", None)
credential = ManagedIdentityCredential(client_id=client_id)
ml_client = MLClient(credential, subscription_id, resource_group, workspace)
```

You can also use SDK V1:

```python
from azureml.core.authentication import MsiAuthentication
from azureml.core import Workspace
client_id = os.environ.get("DEFAULT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID", None)
auth = MsiAuthentication(identity_config={"client_id": client_id})
workspace = Workspace.get("chrjia-eastus", auth=auth, subscription_id=subscription_id, resource_group=resource_group, location="East US")
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use V2 CLI to create a compute instance with assign system-assigned managed identity:

```azurecli
az ml compute create --name myinstance --identity-type SystemAssigned --type ComputeInstance --resource-group my-resource-group --workspace-name my-workspace
```

You can also use V2 CLI with yaml file, for example to create a compute instance with user-assigned managed identity:

```azurecli
Azure Machine Learning compute create --file compute.yaml --resource-group my-resource-group --workspace-name my-workspace
```

The identity definition is contained in compute.yaml file:

```yaml
https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/computeInstance.schema.json
name: myinstance
type: computeinstance
identity:
  type: user_assigned
  user_assigned_identities:
    - resource_id: identity_resource_id
```


# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

You can create compute instance with managed identity from Azure Machine Learning studio:

1. Fill out the form to [create a new compute instance](?tabs=azure-studio#create).
1. Select **Security**.
1. Enable **Assign a managed identity**.
1. Select **System-assigned** or **User-assigned** under **Identity type**.
1. If you selected **User-assigned**, select subscription and name of the identity.

---

Once the managed identity is created, grant the managed identity at least Storage Blob Data Reader role on the storage account of the datastore, see [Accessing storage services](how-to-identity-based-service-authentication.md?tabs=cli#accessing-storage-services). Then, when you work on the compute instance, the managed identity is used automatically to authenticate against datastores.

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the created system managed identity will be in the format /workspace-name/computes/compute-instance-name in your Microsoft Entra ID.

You can also use the managed identity manually to authenticate against other Azure resources. The following example shows how to use it to get an Azure Resource Manager access token:

```python
import requests

def get_access_token_msi(resource):
    client_id = os.environ.get("DEFAULT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID", None)
    resp = requests.get(f"{os.environ['MSI_ENDPOINT']}?resource={resource}&clientid={client_id}&api-version=2017-09-01", headers={'Secret': os.environ["MSI_SECRET"]})
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return resp.json()["access_token"]

arm_access_token = get_access_token_msi("https://management.azure.com")
```

To use Azure CLI with the managed identity for authentication, specify the identity client ID as the username when logging in:

```azurecli
az login --identity --username $DEFAULT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID
```

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use ```azcopy``` when trying to use managed identity. ```azcopy login --identity``` will not work.

## Enable SSH access

SSH access is disabled by default.  SSH access can't be enabled or disabled after creation. Make sure to enable access if you plan to debug interactively with [VS Code Remote](how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote.md).

[!INCLUDE [amlinclude-info](includes/machine-learning-enable-ssh.md)]

### Set up an SSH key later

Although SSH can't be enabled or disabled after creation, you do have the option to set up an SSH key later on an SSH-enabled compute instance. This allows you to set up the SSH key post-creation. To do this, select to enable SSH on your compute instance, and select to "Set up an SSH key later" as the SSH public key source. After the compute instance is created, you can visit the Details page of your compute instance and select to edit your SSH keys. From there, you are able to add your SSH key.

An example of a common use case for this is when creating a compute instance on behalf of another user (see [Create on behalf of](#create-on-behalf-of)) When provisioning a compute instance on behalf of another user, you can enable SSH for the new compute instance owner by selecting __Set up an SSH key later__. This allows for the new owner of the compute instance to set up their SSH key for their newly owned compute instance once it has been created and assigned to them following the previous steps.

### Connect with SSH

[!INCLUDE [ssh-access](includes/machine-learning-ssh-access.md)]

* REST API

The data scientist you create the compute instance for needs the following be [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) permissions:

* *Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/start/action*
* *Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/stop/action*
* *Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/restart/action*
* *Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/applicationaccess/action*
* *Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/updateSchedules/action*

The data scientist can start, stop, and restart the compute instance. They can use the compute instance for:
* Jupyter
* JupyterLab
* RStudio
* Posit Workbench (formerly RStudio Workbench)
* Integrated notebooks

## Add custom applications such as RStudio or Posit Workbench

You can set up other applications, such as RStudio, or Posit Workbench (formerly RStudio Workbench), when creating a compute instance. Follow these steps in studio to set up a custom application on your compute instance

  1. Fill out the form to [create a new compute instance](?tabs=azure-studio-preview#create)
  1. Select **Applications**
  1. Select **Add application**

### Setup Posit Workbench (formerly RStudio Workbench)

RStudio is one of the most popular IDEs among R developers for ML and data science projects. You can easily set up Posit Workbench, which provides access to RStudio along with other development tools, to run on your compute instance, using your own Posit license, and access the rich feature set that Posit Workbench offers

1. Follow the steps listed above to **Add application** when creating your compute instance.
1. Select **Posit Workbench (bring your own license)** in the **Application** dropdown and enter your Posit Workbench license key in the **License key** field. You can get your Posit Workbench license or trial license [from posit](https://posit.co).
1. Select **Create** to add Posit Workbench application to your compute instance.

[!INCLUDE [private link ports](includes/machine-learning-private-link-ports.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> * Support for accessing your workspace file store from Posit Workbench is not yet available.
> * When accessing multiple instances of Posit Workbench, if you see a "400 Bad Request. Request Header Or Cookie Too Large" error, use a new browser or access from a browser in incognito mode.


### Setup RStudio (open source)

To use RStudio, set up a custom application as follows:

1.    Follow the previous steps to **Add application** when creating your compute instance.
1.    Select **Custom Application** in the **Application** dropdown list.
1.    Configure the **Application name** you would like to use.
1. Set up the application to run on **Target port** `8787` - the docker image for RStudio open source listed below needs to run on this Target port.

1. Set up the application to be accessed on **Published port** `8787` - you can configure the application to be accessed on a different Published port if you wish.
1. Point the **Docker image** to `ghcr.io/azure/rocker-rstudio-ml-verse:latest`.

1. Select **Create** to set up RStudio as a custom application on your compute instance.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-compute-instance/rstudio-open-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows form to set up RStudio as a custom application" lightbox="media/how-to-create-compute-instance/rstudio-open-source.png":::

[!INCLUDE [private link ports](includes/machine-learning-private-link-ports.md)]

### Setup other custom applications

Set up other custom applications on your compute instance by providing the application on a Docker image.

1. Follow the previous steps to **Add application** when creating your compute instance.
1. Select **Custom Application** on the **Application** dropdown.
1. Configure the **Application name**, the **Target port** you wish to run the application on, the **Published port** you wish to access the application on and the **Docker image** that contains your application. If your custom image is stored in an Azure Container Registry, assign the **Contributor** role for users of the application. For information on assigning roles, see [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-assign-roles.md).
1. Optionally, add **Environment variables**  you wish to use for your application.
1. Use **Bind mounts** to add access to the files in your default storage account:
   * Specify **/home/azureuser/cloudfiles** for **Host path**.
   * Specify **/home/azureuser/cloudfiles** for the **Container path**.
   * Select **Add** to add this mounting.  Because the files are mounted, changes you make to them are available in other compute instances and applications.
1. Select **Create** to set up the custom application on your compute instance.

### Accessing custom applications in studio

Access the custom applications that you set up in studio:

1. On the left, select **Compute**.
1. On the **Compute instance** tab, see your applications under the **Applications** column.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take a few minutes after setting up a custom application until you can access it via the links. The amount of time taken will depend on the size of the image used for your custom application. If you see a 502 error message when trying to access the application, wait for some time for the application to be set up and try again.
> If the custom image is pulled from an Azure Container Registry, you'll need a **Contributor** role for the workspace. For information on assigning roles, see [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-assign-roles.md).
