# Query & compare experiments and runs with MLflow

Experiments and jobs (or runs) in Azure Machine Learning can be queried using MLflow. You don't need to install any specific SDK to manage what happens inside of a training job, creating a more seamless transition between local runs and the cloud by removing cloud-specific dependencies. In this article, you'll learn how to query and compare experiments and runs in your workspace using Azure Machine Learning and MLflow SDK in Python.

MLflow allows you to:

* Create, query, delete, and search for experiments in a workspace.
* Query, delete, and search for runs in a workspace.
* Track and retrieve metrics, parameters, artifacts, and models from runs.

For a detailed comparison between open-source MLflow and MLflow when connected to Azure Machine Learning, see [Support matrix for querying runs and experiments in Azure Machine Learning](#support-matrix-for-querying-runs-and-experiments).

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 does not provide native logging or tracking capabilities. This applies not just for logging but also for querying the metrics logged. Instead, use MLflow to manage experiments and runs. This article explains how to use MLflow to manage experiments and runs in Azure Machine Learning.

You can also query and search experiments and runs by using the MLflow REST API. See [Using MLflow REST with Azure Machine Learning](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/using-mlflow/using-rest-api/using_mlflow_rest_api.ipynb) for an example about how to consume it.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [mlflow-prereqs](includes/machine-learning-mlflow-prereqs.md)]

## Query and search experiments

Use MLflow to search for experiments inside of your workspace. See the following examples:

* Get all active experiments:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_experiments()
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > In legacy versions of MLflow (<2.0), use method `mlflow.list_experiments()` instead.

* Get all the experiments, including archived:

    ```python
    from mlflow.entities import ViewType
    
    mlflow.search_experiments(view_type=ViewType.ALL)
    ```

* Get a specific experiment by name:

    ```python
    mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name)
    ```

* Get a specific experiment by ID:

    ```python
    mlflow.get_experiment('1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG')
    ```

### Search experiments

The `search_experiments()` method, available since Mlflow 2.0, lets you search for experiments that match criteria using `filter_string`.

* Retrieve multiple experiments based on their IDs:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_experiments(filter_string="experiment_id IN ("
        "'CDEFG-1234-5678-90AB', '1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG', '5678-1234-90AB-CDEFG')"
    )
    ```

* Retrieve all experiments created after a given time:

    ```python
    import datetime

    dt = datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 20, 5, 32, 48)
    mlflow.search_experiments(filter_string=f"creation_time > {int(dt.timestamp())}")
    ```

* Retrieve all experiments with a given tag:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_experiments(filter_string=f"tags.framework = 'torch'")
    ```

## Query and search runs

MLflow lets you search for runs inside any experiment, including multiple experiments at the same time. The method `mlflow.search_runs()` accepts the argument `experiment_ids` and `experiment_name` to indicate which experiments you want to search. You can also indicate `search_all_experiments=True` if you want to search across all the experiments in the workspace:

* By experiment name:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_names=[ "my_experiment" ])
    ```  

* By experiment ID:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ])
    ```

* Search across all experiments in the workspace:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(filter_string="params.num_boost_round='100'", search_all_experiments=True)
    ``` 

Notice that `experiment_ids` supports providing an array of experiments, so you can search runs across multiple experiments, if necessary. This might be useful in case you want to compare runs of the same model when it's being logged in different experiments (for example, by different people or different project iterations).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `experiment_ids`, `experiment_names`, or `search_all_experiments` aren't specified, then MLflow searches by default in the current active experiment. You can set the active experiment using `mlflow.set_experiment()`.

By default, MLflow returns the data in Pandas `Dataframe` format, which makes it handy when doing further processing our analysis of the runs. Returned data includes columns with:

- Basic information about the run.
- Parameters with column's name `params.<parameter-name>`.
- Metrics (last logged value of each) with column's name `metrics.<metric-name>`.

All metrics and parameters are also returned when querying runs. However, for metrics that contain multiple values (for instance, a loss curve, or a PR curve), only the last value of the metric is returned. If you want to retrieve all the values of a given metric, uses `mlflow.get_metric_history` method. See [Getting params and metrics from a run](#get-params-and-metrics-from-a-run) for an example.

### Order runs

By default, experiments are in descending order by `start_time`, which is the time the experiment was queued in Azure Machine Learning. However, you can change this default by using the parameter `order_by`.

* Order runs by attributes, like `start_time`:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ],
                       order_by=["attributes.start_time DESC"])
    ```
  
* Order runs and limit results. The following example returns the last single run in the experiment:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       max_results=1, order_by=["attributes.start_time DESC"])
    ```

* Order runs by the attribute `duration`:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       order_by=["attributes.duration DESC"])
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > `attributes.duration` isn't present in MLflow OSS, but provided in Azure Machine Learning for convenience.

* Order runs by metric's values:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ]).sort_values("metrics.accuracy", ascending=False)
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > Using `order_by` with expressions containing `metrics.*`, `params.*`, or `tags.*` in the parameter `order_by` isn't currently supported. Instead, use the `sort_values` method from Pandas as shown in the example.

### Filter runs

You can also look for a run with a specific combination in the hyperparameters using the parameter `filter_string`. Use `params` to access run's parameters, `metrics` to access metrics logged in the run, and `attributes` to access run information details. MLflow supports expressions joined by the AND keyword (the syntax doesn't support OR):

* Search runs based on a parameter's value:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       filter_string="params.num_boost_round='100'")
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > Only operators `=`, `like`, and `!=` are supported for filtering `parameters`.

* Search runs based on a metric's value:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       filter_string="metrics.auc>0.8")
    ```

* Search runs with a given tag:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       filter_string="tags.framework='torch'")
    ```

* Search runs created by a given user:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       filter_string="attributes.user_id = 'John Smith'")
    ```

* Search runs that failed. See [Filter runs by status](#filter-runs-by-status) for possible values:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       filter_string="attributes.status = 'Failed'")
    ```

* Search runs created after a given time:

    ```python
    import datetime

    dt = datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 20, 5, 32, 48)
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       filter_string=f"attributes.creation_time > '{int(dt.timestamp())}'")
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > For the key `attributes`, values should always be strings and hence encoded between quotes.

* Search runs that take longer than one hour:

    ```python
    duration = 360 * 1000 # duration is in milliseconds
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       filter_string=f"attributes.duration > '{duration}'")
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > `attributes.duration` isn't present in MLflow OSS, but provided in Azure Machine Learning for convenience.
    
* Search runs that have the ID in a given set:

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                       filter_string="attributes.run_id IN ('1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG', '5678-1234-90AB-CDEFG')")
    ```

### Filter runs by status

When you filter runs by status, MLflow uses a different convention to name the different possible status of a run compared to Azure Machine Learning. The following table shows the possible values:

| Azure Machine Learning job status | MLFlow's `attributes.status` | Meaning |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Not started | `Scheduled` | The job/run was received by Azure Machine Learning. |
| Queue | `Scheduled` | The job/run is scheduled for running, but it hasn't started yet. |
| Preparing | `Scheduled` | The job/run hasn't started yet, but a compute was allocated for its execution and it's preparing the environment and its inputs. |
| Running | `Running` | The job/run is currently under active execution. |
| Completed | `Finished` | The job/run was completed without errors. |
| Failed | `Failed` | The job/run was completed with errors. |
| Canceled | `Killed` | The job/run was canceled by the user or terminated by the system. |

Example:

```python
mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ], 
                   filter_string="attributes.status = 'Failed'")
```

## Get metrics, parameters, artifacts, and models

The method `search_runs` returns a Pandas `Dataframe` that contains a limited amount of information by default. You can get Python objects if needed, which might be useful to get details about them. Use the `output_format` parameter to control how output is returned:

```python
runs = mlflow.search_runs(
    experiment_ids=[ "1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG" ],
    filter_string="params.num_boost_round='100'",
    output_format="list",
)
```

Details can then be accessed from the `info` member. The following sample shows how to get the `run_id`:

```python
last_run = runs[-1]
print("Last run ID:", last_run.info.run_id)
```
  
### Get params and metrics from a run

When runs are returned using `output_format="list"`, you can easily access parameters using the key `data`:

```python
last_run.data.params
```

In the same way, you can query metrics:

```python
last_run.data.metrics
```

For metrics that contain multiple values (for instance, a loss curve, or a PR curve), only the last logged value of the metric is returned. If you want to retrieve all the values of a given metric, uses `mlflow.get_metric_history` method. This method requires you to use the `MlflowClient`:

```python
client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
client.get_metric_history("1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG", "log_loss")
```

### Get artifacts from a run

MLflow can query any artifact logged by a run. Artifacts can't be accessed using the run object itself, and the MLflow client should be used instead:

```python
client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
client.list_artifacts("1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG")
```

The preceding method lists all the artifacts logged in the run, but they remain stored in the artifacts store (Azure Machine Learning storage). To download any of them, use the method `download_artifact`:

```python
file_path = mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts(
    run_id="1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG", artifact_path="feature_importance_weight.png"
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> In legacy versions of MLflow (<2.0), use the method `MlflowClient.download_artifacts()` instead.

### Get models from a run

Models can also be logged in the run and then retrieved directly from it. To retrieve a model, you need to know the path to the artifact where it's stored. The method `list_artifacts` can be used to find artifacts that represent a model since MLflow models are always folders. You can download a model by specifying the path where the model is stored, using the `download_artifact` method:

```python
artifact_path="classifier"
model_local_path = mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts(
  run_id="1234-5678-90AB-CDEFG", artifact_path=artifact_path
)
```
  
You can then load the model back from the downloaded artifacts using the typical function `load_model` in the flavor-specific namespace. The following example uses `xgboost`:

```python
model = mlflow.xgboost.load_model(model_local_path)
```

MLflow also allows you to perform both operations at once, and to download and load the model in a single instruction. MLflow downloads the model to a temporary folder and loads it from there. The method `load_model` uses an URI format to indicate from where the model has to be retrieved. In the case of loading a model from a run, the URI structure is as follows:

```python
model = mlflow.xgboost.load_model(f"runs:/{last_run.info.run_id}/{artifact_path}")
```

> [!TIP]
> To query and load models registered in the model registry, see [Manage models registries in Azure Machine Learning with MLflow](how-to-manage-models-mlflow.md).

## Get child (nested) runs

MLflow supports the concept of child (nested) runs. These runs are useful when you need to spin off training routines that must be tracked independently from the main training process. Hyper-parameter tuning optimization processes or Azure Machine Learning pipelines are typical examples of jobs that generate multiple child runs. You can query all the child runs of a specific run using the property tag `mlflow.parentRunId`, which contains the run ID of the parent run.

```python
hyperopt_run = mlflow.last_active_run()
child_runs = mlflow.search_runs(
    filter_string=f"tags.mlflow.parentRunId='{hyperopt_run.info.run_id}'"
)
```

## Compare jobs and models in Azure Machine Learning studio (preview)

To compare and evaluate the quality of your jobs and models in Azure Machine Learning studio, use the [preview panel](./how-to-enable-preview-features.md) to enable the feature. Once enabled, you can compare the parameters, metrics, and tags between the jobs and/or models you selected.
