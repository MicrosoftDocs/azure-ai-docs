# Generate responsible AI text insights with YAML and Python (preview)

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

The [Responsible AI (RAI) dashboard](concept-responsible-ai-dashboard.md) brings together several RAI tools in a single interface to help inform data-driven decisions about your models. Understanding natural language processing (NLP) models can be different from assessing tabular data. RAI dashboard model debugging and visualizations now support text data.

The Responsible AI text dashboard provides several mature RAI tools in the areas of error analysis, model interpretability, unfairness assessment, and mitigation. The dashboard supports holistic assessment and debugging of NLP models to aid in making informed business decisions.

This article describes the Responsible AI text insights component and how to use it in a pipeline job to generate a Responsible AI text dashboard. The following sections provide specifications and requirements for the text insights component and example code snippets in YAML and Python.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Responsible AI text insights component is currently in public preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and isn't recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Responsible AI text insights component

The Azure Machine Learning Responsible AI text insights component assembles generated insights into a single Responsible AI text dashboard, and is the only core component used for constructing the RAI text dashboard. This construction differs from the [Responsible AI pipeline for tabular data](how-to-responsible-ai-insights-sdk-cli.md#responsible-ai-components), which uses several components.

### Requirements and limitations

- All models must be registered in Azure Machine Learning.
- MLflow models with a sklearn (scikit-learn) or PyTorch flavor and HuggingFace models are supported.
- The training and test dataset inputs must be in `mltable` format.
- The test dataset is restricted to 5,000 rows of the visualization UI, for performance reasons.

### Parameters

The Responsible AI text insights component supports the following scenarios through the `task_type` parameter:

| Name                            | Description                                         | Parameter value                              |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Text Classification | Predicts classes for the given text content | `task_type="text_classification"` |
| Multi-label Text Classification | Predicts multiple classes for the given text content | `task_type="multilabel_text_classification"` |
| Text Question Answering | Evaluates a question answering model on the text dataset | `task_type="question_answering"` |

The component accepts the following optional parameters:

| Parameter name | Description | Type |
|----------------|-------------|------|
| `title` | Brief description of the dashboard. | String |
| `classes` | The full list of class labels in the training dataset. | List of strings |
| `maximum_rows_for_test_dataset` | The maximum number of rows allowed in the test dataset. Defaults to 5,000. | Integer |
| `target_column_name` | The name of the column in the input datasets that the model is trying to predict. | String |
| `enable_explanation` | Enable generating an explanation for the model.  | Boolean |
| `enable_error_analysis` | Enable generating an error analysis for the model.  | Boolean|
| `use_model_dependency` | The Responsible AI environment doesn't include the model dependencies by default. When set to `True`, installs the model dependency packages.  | Boolean |
| `use_conda` | Installs the model dependency packages using `conda` if set to `True`, otherwise uses `pip`.  | Boolean |

### Ports

The Responsible AI text insights component has three major input ports:

- The machine learning model
- The training dataset
- The test dataset

The training and test datasets don't have to be, but can be the same dataset. The easiest way to supply the model input is to register the model and reference the same model in the `model_input` port of the Responsible AI text insights component.

There are two output ports:

- The `dashboard` port contains the completed `RAITextInsights` object.
- The `ux_json` port contains the data required to display a minimal dashboard.

### Pipeline job

To create the Responsible AI text dashboard, you can define the RAI components in a pipeline and submit the pipeline job.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

You can specify the pipeline in a YAML file, as in the following example, and submit it by using the Azure CLI `az ml job create` command.

```yml
  analyse_model: 
    type: command 
    component: azureml://registries/AzureML/components/rai_text_insights/versions/2 
    inputs: 
      title: From YAML  
      task_type: text_classification 
      model_input: 
        type: mlflow_model 
        path: {azureml_model_id}
      model_info: ${{{{parent.inputs.model_info}}}} 
      train_dataset: ${{{{parent.inputs.my_training_data}}}} 
      test_dataset: ${{{{parent.inputs.my_test_data}}}} 
      target_column_name: {target_column_name} 
      maximum_rows_for_test_dataset: 5000 
      classes: '[]' 
      enable_explanation: True 
      enable_error_analysis: True 
```

# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

The Responsible AI text dashboard uses the [Responsible AI Text SDK for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox/tree/main/responsibleai_text).

In your Python script, load the RAI text insights component:

```python
rai_text_insights_component = ml_client_registry.components.get( 
    name="rai_text_insights", version=version_string 
) 
```

Inside the pipeline, initiate the RAI text insights as in the following example:

```python
        rai_text_job = rai_text_insights_component( 
            title="From Python", 
            task_type="text_classification", 
            model_info=expected_model_id, 
            model_input=Input(type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL, path= azureml_model_id), 
            train_dataset=train_data, 
            test_dataset=test_data, 
            target_column_name=target_column_name, 
            classes=classes, 
        ) 
```

And assemble the output:

```python
        rai_text_job.outputs.dashboard.mode = "upload" 
        rai_text_job.outputs.ux_json.mode = "upload" 
```
