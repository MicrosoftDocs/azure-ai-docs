# CLI (v2) Azure OpenAI connection YAML schema

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

[!INCLUDE [schema note](includes/machine-learning-preview-old-json-schema-note.md)]

## YAML syntax

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `$schema` | string | The YAML schema. If you use the Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension to author the YAML file, include `$schema` at the top of your file to invoke schema and resource completions. | | |
| `name` | string | **Required.** The connection name. | | |
| `description` | string | The connection description. | | |
| `tags` | object | The connection tag dictionary. | | |
| `type` | string | **Required.** The connection type. | `azure_open_ai` | `azure_open_ai` |
| `is_shared` | boolean | `true` if the connection is shared across other projects in the hub; otherwise, `false`. | | `true` |
| `endpoint` | string | **Required.** The URL of the endpoint. | | |
| `api_key` | string | The API key used to authenticate the connection. If not provided, the connection is authenticated via Microsoft Entra ID (credential-less authentication). | | |
| `open_ai_resource_id` | string | **Required.** The fully qualified Azure resource ID of the Azure OpenAI resource. | | |


## Remarks

The schema described in this article is used to create a connection to Azure OpenAI only. If you would rather create a single connection for Azure AI Services, see the [Azure AI Services connection schema](reference-yaml-connection-ai-services.md). If you need to create a connection to the non-Microsoft OpenAI service, see the [OpenAI connection schema](reference-yaml-connection-openai.md).

While the `az ml connection` commands can be used to manage both Azure Machine Learning and Azure AI Foundry connections, the Azure AI Services connection is specific to Azure AI Foundry.

## Examples

These examples would be in the form of YAML files and used from the CLI. For example, `az ml connection create -f <file-name>.yaml`. 

### YAML: API key

```yml
#AzureOpenAIConnection.yml

name: myazopenai_apk
type: azure_open_ai
azure_endpoint: https://contoso.openai.azure.com/
api_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```


### YAML: Microsoft Entra ID

```yml
#AzureOpenAIConnection.yml

name: myazopenai_apk
type: azure_open_ai
azure_endpoint: https://contoso.openai.azure.com/
```
