# Tutorial: Train a classification model with no-code AutoML in the Azure Machine Learning studio

In this tutorial, you learn how to train a classification model with no-code automated machine learning (AutoML) using Azure Machine Learning in the Azure Machine Learning studio. This classification model predicts whether a client subscribes to a fixed term deposit with a financial institution.

With Automated ML, you can automate away time intensive tasks. Automated machine learning rapidly iterates over many combinations of algorithms and hyperparameters to help you find the best model based on a success metric of your choosing.

You don't write any code in this tutorial. You use the studio interface to perform training. You learn how to do the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace
> - Run an automated machine learning experiment
> - Explore model details
> - Deploy the recommended model

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- Download the [**bankmarketing_train.csv**](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv) data file. The **y** column indicates if a customer subscribed to a fixed term deposit, which is later identified as the target column for predictions in this tutorial.

## Create a workspace

An Azure Machine Learning workspace is a foundational resource in the cloud that you use to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models. It ties your Azure subscription and resource group to an easily consumed object in the service.

Complete the following steps to create a workspace and continue the tutorial.

1. Sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

1. Select **Create workspace**.

1. Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:

   | Field | Description |
   |:---|:--- |
   |  Workspace name | Enter a unique name that identifies your workspace. Names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that's easy to recall and to differentiate from workspaces created by others. The workspace name is case-insensitive. |
   | Subscription | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use. |
   | Resource group | Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. You need *contributor* or *owner* role to use an existing resource group. For more information, see [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-assign-roles.md). |
   | Region | Select the Azure region closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace. |

1. Select **Create** to create the workspace.

For more information on Azure resources, see [Create the workspace](quickstart-create-resources.md#create-the-workspace).

For other ways to create a workspace in Azure, [Manage Azure Machine Learning workspaces in the portal or with the Python SDK (v2)](how-to-manage-workspace.md).

## Create an Automated Machine Learning job

Complete the following experiment set-up and run steps by using the Azure Machine Learning studio at https://ml.azure.com. Machine Learning Studio is a consolidated web interface that includes machine learning tools to perform data science scenarios for data science practitioners of all skill levels. The studio isn't supported on Internet Explorer browsers.

1. Select your subscription and the workspace you created.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Authoring** > **Automated ML**.

1. Select  **Next** to proceed to task settings.

## Configure job

After you load and configure your data, you can set up your experiment. This setup includes experiment design tasks such as, selecting the size of your compute environment and specifying what column you want to predict.

1. Populate the **Task settings** form as follows:

   1. Select **y (String)** as the target column, which is what you want to predict. This column indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit or not.
   1. Select **View additional configuration settings** and populate the fields as follows. These settings are to better control the training job. Otherwise, defaults are applied based on experiment selection and data.

      | Additional&nbsp;configurations | Description | Value&nbsp;for&nbsp;tutorial |
      |:------|:---------|:---|
      | Primary metric| Evaluation metric used to measure the machine learning algorithm. | AUCWeighted |

1. Select **Create**.

   Creating a compute can take minutes to complete.

1. After creation, select your new compute target from the list. Select **Next**.

1. Select **Submit training job** to run the experiment. The **Overview** screen opens with the **Status** at the top as the experiment preparation begins. This status updates as the experiment progresses. Notifications also appear in the studio to inform you of the status of your experiment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Preparation takes **10-15 minutes** to prepare the experiment run. Once running, it takes **2-3 minutes more for each iteration**.
>
> In production, you'd likely walk away for a bit. But for this tutorial, you can start exploring the tested algorithms on the **Models** tab as they complete while the others continue to run.

## Explore models

Navigate to the **Models + child jobs** tab to see the algorithms (models) tested. By default, the job orders the models by metric score as they complete. For this tutorial, the model that scores the highest based on the chosen **AUCWeighted** metric is at the top of the list.

While you wait for all of the experiment models to finish, select the **Algorithm name** of a completed model to explore its performance details. Select the **Overview** and the **Metrics** tabs for information about the job.

The following animation views the selected model's properties, metrics, and performance charts.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml/run-detail.gif" alt-text="Animation that shows different views available for a child job." lightbox="./media/tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml/run-detail.gif":::

## View model explanations

While you wait for the models to complete, you can also take a look at model explanations and see which data features (raw or engineered) influenced a particular model's predictions.

These model explanations can be generated on demand. The model explanations dashboard that's part of the **Explanations (preview)** tab summarizes these explanations.

To generate model explanations:

1. In the navigation links at the top of the page, select the job name to go back to the **Models** screen.
1. Select the **Models + child jobs** tab.
1. For this tutorial, select the first **MaxAbsScaler, LightGBM** model.
1. Select **Explain model**. On the right, the **Explain model** pane appears.
1. Select your compute type and then select the instance or cluster: **automl-compute** that you created previously. This compute starts a child job to generate the model explanations.
1. Select **Create**. A green success message appears.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The explainability job takes about 2-5 minutes to complete.

1. Select **Explanations (preview)**. This tab populates after the explainability run completes.
1. On the left, expand the pane. Under **Features**, select the row that says **raw**.
1. Select the **Aggregate feature importance** tab. This chart shows which data features influenced the predictions of the selected model.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml/model-explanation-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Model explanation dashboard, displaying an aggregate feature importance chart." lightbox="media/tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml/model-explanation-dashboard.png":::

   In this example, the *duration* appears to have the most influence on the predictions of this model.

## Deploy the best model

The automated machine learning interface allows you to deploy the best model as a web service. *Deployment* is the integration of the model so it can predict on new data and identify potential areas of opportunity. For this experiment, deployment to a web service means that the financial institution now has an iterative and scalable web solution for identifying potential fixed term deposit customers.

Check to see whether your experiment run is complete. To do so, navigate back to the parent job page by selecting the job name at the top of your screen. A **Completed** status is shown on the top left of the screen.

After the experiment run is complete, the **Details** page is populated with a **Best model summary** section. In this experiment context, **VotingEnsemble** is considered the best model, based on the **AUCWeighted** metric.

Deploy this model. Deployment takes about 20 minutes to complete. The deployment process entails several steps including registering the model, generating resources, and configuring them for the web service.

1. Select **VotingEnsemble** to open the model-specific page.

1. Select **Deploy** > **Web service**.

1. Populate the **Deploy a model** pane as follows:

   | Field | Value |
   |:----|:----|
   | Name | my-automl-deploy |
   | Description | My first automated machine learning experiment deployment |
   | Compute type | Select Azure Container Instance |
   | Enable authentication | Disable. |
   | Use custom deployment assets | Disable. Allows for the default driver file (scoring script) and environment file to be autogenerated. |

   For this example, use the defaults provided in the **Advanced** menu.

1. Select **Deploy**.

   A green success message appears at the top of the **Job** screen. In the **Model summary** pane, a status message appears under **Deploy status**. Select **Refresh** periodically to check the deployment status.

You have an operational web service to generate predictions.

Proceed to the [Related content](#related-content) to learn more about how to consume your new web service, and test your predictions using Power BI built in Azure Machine Learning support.

## Clean up resources

Deployment files are larger than data and experiment files, so they cost more to store. If you want to keep your workspace and experiment files, delete only the deployment files to minimize costs to your account. If you don't plan to use any of the files, delete the entire resource group.

### Delete the deployment instance

Delete just the deployment instance from Azure Machine Learning at https:\//ml.azure.com/.

1. Go to [Azure Machine Learning](https://ml.azure.com/). Navigate to your workspace and under the **Assets** pane, select **Endpoints**.

1. Select the deployment you want to delete and select **Delete**.

1. Select **Proceed**.

### Delete the resource group
