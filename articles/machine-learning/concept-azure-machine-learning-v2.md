# How Azure Machine Learning works: resources and assets

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

This article applies to the second version of the [Azure Machine Learning CLI & Python SDK (v2)](concept-v2.md). For version one (v1), see [How Azure Machine Learning works: Architecture and concepts (v1)](v1/concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md?view=azureml-api-1&preserve-view=true)

Azure Machine Learning includes several resources and assets to enable you to perform your machine learning tasks. These resources and assets are needed to run any job.

* **Resources**: setup or infrastructural resources needed to run a machine learning workflow. Resources include:
  * [Workspace](#workspace)
  * [Compute](#compute)
  * [Datastore](#datastore)
* **Assets**: created using Azure Machine Learning commands or as part of a training/scoring run. Assets are versioned and can be registered in the Azure Machine Learning workspace. They include:
  * [Model](#model)
  * [Environment](#environment)
  * [Data](#data)
  * [Component](#component)

This document provides a quick overview of these resources and assets.

## Prerequisites

### [Python SDK](#tab/sdk)

To use the Python SDK code examples in this article:

1. Install the [Python SDK v2](https://aka.ms/sdk-v2-install)
2. Create a connection to your Azure Machine Learning subscription. The examples all rely on `ml_client`. To create a workspace, the connection doesn't need a workspace name, since you may not yet have one. All other examples in this article require that the workspace name is included in the connection.

    ```python
    # import required libraries
    from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import Workspace
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    
    # Enter details of your subscription
    subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
    resource_group = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
    
    # get a handle to the subscription (use this if you haven't created a workspace yet)
    ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group)
    
    # all other examples in this article require the connection to include workspace name
    workspace_name = "<WORKSPACE_NAME>"
    ml_client = ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace_name)
    ```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

To use the Azure CLI code examples in this article, you need to have the Azure CLI installed and configured. You can install the Azure CLI from the [Install and set up the CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md).

Once you have the Azure CLI installed, sign in to your Azure account:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/misc.sh" id="az_login":::

If you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions, you set your active subscription:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/misc.sh" id="az_account_set":::


### [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

Sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

## Workspace

The workspace is the top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning, providing a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning. The workspace keeps a history of all jobs, including logs, metrics, output, and a snapshot of your scripts. The workspace stores references to resources like datastores and compute. It also holds all assets like models, environments, components, and data asset.

### Create a workspace

### [Python SDK](#tab/sdk)

To create a workspace using Python SDK v2, you can use the following code:

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

```python
# specify the workspace details
ws = Workspace(
    name="my_workspace",
    location="eastus",
    display_name="My workspace",
    description="This example shows how to create a workspace",
    tags=dict(purpose="demo"),
)

ml_client.workspaces.begin_create(ws) # use MLClient to connect to the subscription and resource group and create workspace
```

This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/resources/workspace/workspace.ipynb) shows more ways to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace using SDK v2.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

To create a workspace using CLI v2, use the following command:

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

```bash
az ml workspace create --file my_workspace.yml
```

For the content of the file, see [workspace YAML examples](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/resources/workspace).

### [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

Create a workspace in the studio welcome page by selecting **Create workspace**.

For more detailed information about creating a workspace, see [Manage Azure Machine Learning workspaces in the portal or with the Python SDK (v2)](how-to-manage-workspace.md).

## Compute

A compute is a designated compute resource where you run your job or host your endpoint. Azure Machine Learning supports the following types of compute:

* **Compute instance** - a fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud. You can use the instance as a training or inference compute for development and testing. It's similar to a virtual machine on the cloud.
* **Compute cluster** - a managed-compute infrastructure that allows you to easily create a cluster of CPU or GPU compute nodes in the cloud.
* **Serverless compute** - a compute cluster you access on the fly. When you use serverless compute, you don't need to create your own cluster. All compute lifecycle management is offloaded to Azure Machine Learning.
* **Inference cluster** - used to deploy trained machine learning models to Azure Kubernetes Service. You can create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from your Azure Machine Learning workspace, or attach an existing AKS cluster.
* **Attached compute** - You can attach your own compute resources to your workspace and use them for training and inference.

### Create a compute

### [Python SDK](#tab/sdk)

To create a compute cluster using Python SDK v2, you can use the following code:

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

```python
cluster_basic = AmlCompute(
    name="basic-example",
    type="amlcompute",
    size="STANDARD_DS3_v2",
    location="westus",
    min_instances=0,
    max_instances=2,
    idle_time_before_scale_down=120,
)
ml_client.begin_create_or_update(cluster_basic)
```

This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/resources/compute/compute.ipynb) shows more ways to create compute using SDK v2.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

To create a compute using CLI v2, use the following command:

```bash
az ml compute create --file my_compute.yml
```

For the content of the file, see [compute YAML examples](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/resources/compute).

### [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

1. Select a workspace if you aren't already in one.
1. From the left-hand menu, select **Compute**.
1. On the top, select a tab to specify the type of compute you want to create.
1. Select **New** to create the new compute.

For more detailed information about creating compute, see:

* [Create an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](how-to-create-compute-instance.md)
* [Create an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster](how-to-create-attach-compute-cluster.md)

## Datastore

Azure Machine Learning datastores securely keep the connection information to your data storage on Azure, so you don't have to code it in your scripts. You can register and create a datastore to easily connect to your storage account, and access the data in your underlying storage service. The CLI v2 and SDK v2 support the following types of cloud-based storage services:

* Azure Blob Container
* Azure File Share
* Azure Data Lake
* Azure Data Lake Gen2

### Create a datastore

### [Python SDK](#tab/sdk)

To create a datastore using Python SDK v2, you can use the following code:

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

```python
import AzureBlobDatastore

blob_datastore1 = AzureBlobDatastore(
    name="blob_example",
    description="Datastore pointing to a blob container.",
    account_name="mytestblobstore",
    container_name="data-container",
    credentials={
        "account_key": "XXXxxxXXXxXXXXxxXXXXXxXXXXXxXxxXxXXXxXXXxXXxxxXXxxXXXxXxXXXxxXxxXXXXxxxxxXXxxxxxxXXXxXXX"
    },
)
ml_client.create_or_update(blob_datastore1)
```

This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/resources/datastores/datastore.ipynb) shows more ways to create datastores using SDK v2.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

```bash
az ml datastore create --file my_datastore.yml
```

For the content of the file, see [datastore YAML examples](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/resources/datastore).

### [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

1. Select a workspace if you aren't already in one.
1. From the left-hand menu, select **Data**.
1. On the top, select **Datastores**.
1. Select **Create** to create a new datastore.

To learn more about using a datastore, see [Create and manage data assets](how-to-create-data-assets.md).

## Model

Azure Machine Learning models consist of one or more binary files that represent a machine learning model and any corresponding metadata. Models can be created from a local or remote file or directory. For remote locations `https`, `wasbs` and `azureml` locations are supported. The created model is tracked in the workspace under the specified name and version. Azure Machine Learning supports three types of storage format for models:

* `custom_model`
* `mlflow_model`
* `triton_model`

### Create a model in the model registry

Model registration allows you to store and version your models in the Azure cloud, in your workspace. The model registry helps you organize and keep track of your trained models.

For more information on how to create models in the registry, see [Work with models in Azure Machine Learning](how-to-manage-models.md).

## Environment

Azure Machine Learning environments are an encapsulation of the environment where your machine learning task happens. They specify the software packages, environment variables, and software settings around your training and scoring scripts. The environments are managed and versioned entities within your Machine Learning workspace. Environments enable reproducible, auditable, and portable machine learning workflows across various computes.

### Types of environment

Azure Machine Learning supports two types of environments: curated and custom.

Curated environments are provided by Azure Machine Learning and are available in your workspace by default. Intended to be used as is, they contain collections of Python packages and settings to help you get started with various machine learning frameworks. These precreated environments also allow for faster deployment time. For a full list, see the [curated environments article](resource-curated-environments.md).

In custom environments, you're responsible for setting up your environment and installing packages or any other dependencies that your training or scoring script needs on the compute. Azure Machine Learning allows you to create your own environment using

* A docker image
* A base docker image with a conda YAML to customize further
* A docker build context

### Create an Azure Machine Learning custom environment


### [Python SDK](#tab/sdk)

To create an environment using Python SDK v2, see [Create an environment](how-to-manage-environments-v2.md?tabs=python#create-a-custom-environment).

This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/assets/environment/environment.ipynb) shows more ways to create custom environments using SDK v2.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

To create an environment using CLI v2, see [Create an environment](how-to-manage-environments-v2.md?tabs=cli#create-a-custom-environment).

For more information, see [environment YAML schema](reference-yaml-environment.md).

### [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

1. Select a workspace if you aren't already in one.
1. From the left-hand menu, select **Environments**.
1. On the top, select **Custom environments**.
1. Select **Create** to create a new custom environment.

---

For more detailed information about environments, see [Create and manage environments in Azure Machine Learning](how-to-manage-environments-v2.md).

## Data

Azure Machine Learning allows you to work with different types of data:

* URIs (a location in local/cloud storage)
  * `uri_folder`
  * `uri_file`
* Tables (a tabular data abstraction)
  * `mltable`
* Primitives
  * `string`
  * `boolean`
  * `number`

For most scenarios, you use URIs (`uri_folder` and `uri_file`) - a location in storage that can be easily mapped to the filesystem of a compute node in a job by either mounting or downloading the storage to the node.

`mltable` is an abstraction for tabular data that is to be used for AutoML Jobs, Parallel Jobs, and some advanced scenarios. If you're just starting to use Azure Machine Learning and aren't using AutoML, we strongly encourage you to begin with URIs.

## Component

An Azure Machine Learning [component](concept-component.md) is a self-contained piece of code that does one step in a machine learning pipeline. Components are the building blocks of advanced machine learning pipelines. Components can do tasks such as data processing, model training, model scoring, and so on. A component is analogous to a function - it has a name, parameters, expects input, and returns output.
