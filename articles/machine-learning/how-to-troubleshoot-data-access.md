# Troubleshoot data access errors

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

In this article, learn how to identify and resolve known data access issues with the [Azure Machine Learning SDK](https://aka.ms/sdk-v2-install).

## Error Codes

Data access error codes are hierarchical. The full stop character `.` delimits error codes, and these codes become more specific with more segments available.

## ScriptExecution.DatabaseConnection

### ScriptExecution.DatabaseConnection.NotFound

The database or server defined in the datastore can't be found, or no longer exists. Check if the database still exists in Azure portal, or if the Azure Machine Learning studio datastore details page links to it. If it doesn't exist, enable the existing datastore for use if you recreate it with the same name. To use a new server name or database, you must delete and recreate the datastore to use the new name.

### ScriptExecution.DatabaseConnection.Authentication

The authentication failed while trying to connect to the database. The authentication method is stored inside the datastore, and it supports SQL authentication, service principal, or no stored credential (identity based access). When you preview data in Azure Machine Learning studio, enablement of workspace MSI makes the authentication use that workspace MSI. A SQL server user needs to be created for the service principal and workspace MSI (if applicable), and that user must be granted classic database permissions. For more information, visit [here](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-service-principal-tutorial#create-the-service-principal-user).

Contact your data admin to verify or add the correct permissions to the service principal or user identity.

Errors also include:

- ScriptExecution.DatabaseConnection.Authentication.AzureIdentityAccessTokenResolution.InvalidResource
  - The server under the subscription and resource group couldn't be found. Check that the subscription ID and resource group defined in the datastore match the corresponding values of the server, and update the datastore values if necessary.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Use the subscription ID and resource group of the server, not of the workspace. If the datastore is cross subscription or cross resource group server, these will differ.
- ScriptExecution.DatabaseConnection.Authentication.AzureIdentityAccessTokenResolution.FirewallSettingsResolutionFailure
  - The identity doesn't have permission to read the target server firewall settings. Contact your data admin to obtain the MSI Reader role permission to the workspace MSI.

## ScriptExecution.DatabaseQuery

### ScriptExecution.DatabaseQuery.TimeoutExpired

The executed SQL query took too long and timed out. You can specify the timeout value at time of data asset creation. If a new timeout is needed, a new asset must be created, or a new version of the current asset must be created. Azure Machine Learning studio SQL preview has a fixed query timeout value, but the defined value is always honored for jobs.

## ScriptExecution.StreamAccess

### ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.Authentication

The authentication failed while trying to connect to the storage account. The authentication method is stored inside the datastore, and depending on the datastore type, it can support account key, SAS token, service principal, or no stored credential (identity based access). When you preview data in Azure Machine Learning studio, enablement of workspace MSI makes the authentication use the workspace MSI.

Contact your data admin to verify or add the correct permissions to the service principal or user identity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If identity based access is used, the required RBAC role is Storage Blob Data Reader. If workspace MSI is used for Azure Machine Learning studio preview, the required RBAC roles are `Storage Blob Data Reader` and `Reader`.

Errors also include:

- ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.Authentication.AzureIdentityAccessTokenResolution.FirewallSettingsResolutionFailure
  - The identity doesn't have permission to read the firewall settings of the target storage account. Contact your data admin to obtain the Reader role permission to the workspace MSI.
- ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.Authentication.AzureIdentityAccessTokenResolution.PrivateEndpointResolutionFailure
  - The target storage account uses a virtual network, but the logged-in session isn't connecting to the workspace via a private endpoint. Add a private endpoint to the workspace, and ensure that the storage virtual network settings allows the virtual network or subnet of the private endpoint. Add the public IP of the logged-in session to the storage firewall allowlist.
- ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.Authentication.AzureIdentityAccessTokenResolution.NetworkIsolationViolated
  - The target storage account firewall settings don't permit this data access. Check that your logged-in session falls within compatible network settings with the storage account. If Workspace MSI is used, check that it has Reader access to the storage account and to the private endpoints associated with the storage account.
- ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.Authentication.AzureIdentityAccessTokenResolution.InvalidResource
  - The storage account under the subscription and resource group couldn't be found. Check that the subscription ID and resource group defined in the datastore match the corresponding values of the server, and update the datastore values if necessary.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Use the subscription ID and resource group of the server, and not of the workspace. These will be different for a cross subscription or cross resource group server.

### ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.NotFound

The specified file or folder path doesn't exist. Check that the provided path exists in Azure portal, or if using a datastore, that the correct datastore is used (including the account and container of the datastore). If the storage account is an HNS enabled Blob storage (also known as ADLS Gen2), or an `abfs[s]` URI, that storage ACLs might restrict particular folders or paths. This error appears as a "NotFound" error instead of an "Authentication" error.

### ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.Validation

There were validation errors in the request for data access.

Errors also include:

- ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.Validation.TextFile-InvalidEncoding
  - The defined encoding for delimited file parsing isn't applicable for the underlying data. Update the encoding of the MLTable to match the encoding of the file(s).
- ScriptExecution.StreamAccess.Validation.StorageRequest-InvalidUri
  - The requested URI isn't well formatted. We support `abfs[s]`, `wasb[s]`, `https`, and `azureml` URIs.
