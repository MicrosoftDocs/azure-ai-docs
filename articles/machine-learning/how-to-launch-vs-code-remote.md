# Launch Visual Studio Code integrated with Azure Machine Learning

In this article, you learn how to launch Visual Studio Code remotely connected to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance. Use VS Code as your integrated development environment (IDE) with the power of Azure Machine Learning resources. Use VS Code in the browser with VS Code for the Web, or use the VS Code desktop application.

There are two ways you can connect to a compute instance from Visual Studio Code. We recommend the first approach.

1. **Use VS Code as your workspace's integrated development environment (IDE).** This option provides you with a **full-featured development environment** for building your machine learning projects.
    * You can open VS Code from your workspace either in the browser [VS Code for the Web](?tabs=vscode-web#use-vs-code-as-your-workspace-ide) or desktop application [VS Code Desktop](?tabs=vscode-desktop#use-vs-code-as-your-workspace-ide).
    * We recommend **VS Code for the Web**, as you can do all your machine learning work directly from the browser, and without any required installations or dependencies.

1. **Remote Jupyter Notebook server**. This option allows you to set a compute instance as a remote Jupyter Notebook server. This option is only available in VS Code (Desktop).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To connect to a compute instance behind a firewall, see [Configure inbound and outbound network traffic](how-to-access-azureml-behind-firewall.md#scenario-visual-studio-code).

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need:

1. [!INCLUDE [workspace and compute instance](includes/prerequisite-workspace-compute-instance.md)]
1. [!INCLUDE [sign in](includes/prereq-sign-in.md)]

## Use VS Code as your workspace IDE

Use one of these options to connect VS Code to your compute instance and workspace files.

# [Studio -> VS Code (Web)](#tab/vscode-web)

VS Code for the Web provides you with a **full-featured development environment** for building your machine learning projects, all from the browser and **without required installations or dependencies**. And by connecting your Azure Machine Learning compute instance, you get the rich and integrated development experience VS Code offers, enhanced by the power of Azure Machine Learning.

Launch VS Code for the Web with one select from the Azure Machine Learning studio, and seamlessly continue your work.

Sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com) and follow the steps to launch a VS Code (Web) browser tab, connected to your Azure Machine Learning compute instance.

You can create the connection from either the **Notebooks** or **Compute** section of Azure Machine Learning studio.

# [From VS Code](#tab/extension)

This option connects your current VS Code session to a remote compute instance. In order to connect to your compute instance _from_ VS Code, you need to install the Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension. For more information, see the [Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code Extension setup guide](how-to-setup-vs-code.md).

### Azure Machine Learning Extension

1. In VS Code, launch the Azure Machine Learning extension.
1. Expand the **Compute instances** node in your extension.
1. Right-click the compute instance you want to connect to and select **Connect to Compute Instance**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-launch-vs-code-remote/vs-code-connect-compute-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to connect to compute instance." lightbox="media/how-to-launch-vs-code-remote/vs-code-connect-compute-instance.png":::

### Command Palette

1. In VS Code, open the command palette by selecting **View > Command Palette**.
1. Enter into the text box **AzureML: Connect to Compute Instance**.
1. Select your subscription.
1. Select your workspace.
1. Select your compute instance or create a new one.

---

If you pick one of the click-out experiences, a new VS Code window is opened, and a connection attempt made to the remote compute instance. When attempting to make this connection, the following steps are taking place:

1. Authorization. Some checks are performed to make sure the user attempting to make a connection is authorized to use the compute instance.
1. VS Code Remote Server is installed on the compute instance.
1. A WebSocket connection is established for real-time interaction.

Once the connection is established, it's persisted. A token is issued at the start of the session, which gets refreshed automatically to maintain the connection with your compute instance.

After you connect to your remote compute instance, use the editor to:

* [Author and manage files on your remote compute instance or file share](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics).
* Use the [VS Code integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) to run commands and applications on your remote compute instance.
* [Debug your scripts and applications](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging)
* [Use VS Code to manage your Git repositories](concept-train-model-git-integration.md)

## Remote Jupyter Notebook server

This option allows you to use a compute instance as a remote Jupyter Notebook server from Visual Studio Code (Desktop). This option connects only to the compute instance, not the rest of the workspace. You won't see your workspace files in VS Code when using this option.

In order to configure a compute instance as a remote Jupyter Notebook server, first install:

* Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension. For more information, see the [Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code Extension setup guide](how-to-setup-vs-code.md).

To connect to a compute instance:

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code.
1. When the integrated notebook experience loads, choose **Select Kernel**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-launch-vs-code-remote/launch-server-selection-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select Jupyter Server." lightbox="media/how-to-launch-vs-code-remote/launch-server-selection-dropdown.png"::: 

    Alternatively, use the command palette:

    1. Select **View > Command Palette** from the menu bar to open the command palette.
    1. Enter into the text box `AzureML: Connect to Compute instance Jupyter server`.

1. Choose `Azure ML Compute Instances` from the list of Jupyter server options.
1. Select your subscription from the list of subscriptions. If you have previously configured your default Azure Machine Learning workspace, this step is skipped.
1. Select your workspace.
1. Select your compute instance from the list. If you don't have one, select **Create new Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance** and follow the prompts to create one.
1. For the changes to take effect, you have to reload Visual Studio Code.
1. Open a Jupyter Notebook and run a cell.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **MUST** run a cell in order to establish the connection.

At this point, you can continue to run cells in your Jupyter Notebook.

> [!TIP]
> You can also work with Python script files (.py) containing Jupyter-like code cells. For more information, see the [Visual Studio Code Python interactive documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py).
