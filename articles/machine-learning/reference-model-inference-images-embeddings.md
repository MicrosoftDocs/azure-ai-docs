# Reference: Image Embeddings | Azure Machine Learning

Creates an embedding vector representing the input image and text pair.

```http
POST /images/embeddings?api-version=2024-04-01-preview
```

## URI Parameters

| Name | In  | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| api-version | query | True | string | The version of the API in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM-DD-preview". |

## Request Header


| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| extra-parameters | | string | The behavior of the API when extra parameters are indicated in the payload. Using `pass-through` makes the API to pass the parameter to the underlying model. Use this value when you want to pass parameters that you know the underlying model can support. Using `ignore` makes the API to drop any unsupported parameter. Use this value when you need to use the same payload across different models, but one of the extra parameters may make a model to error out if not supported. Using `error` makes the API to reject any extra parameter in the payload. Only parameters specified in this API can be indicated, or a 400 error is returned. |
| azureml-model-deployment |     | string | Name of the deployment you want to route the request to. Supported for endpoints that support multiple deployments. |

## Request Body


| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| model |      | string | The model name. This parameter is ignored if the endpoint serves only one model. |
| input | True | [EmbeddingInput](#embeddinginput)\[\] | Input image to embed. To embed multiple inputs in a single request, pass an array. The input must not exceed the max input tokens for the model. |
| dimensions |     | integer | The number of dimensions the resulting output embeddings should have. Passing null causes the model to use its default value. Returns a 422 error if the model doesn't support the value or parameter. |
| encoding\_format |     | [EmbeddingEncodingFormat](#embeddingencodingformat) | The format to return the embeddings in. Either base64, float, int8, uint8, binary, or ubinary. Returns a 422 error if the model doesn't support the value or parameter. |
