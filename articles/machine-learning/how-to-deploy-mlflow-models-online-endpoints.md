# Deploy MLflow models to online endpoints

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

In this article, you see how to deploy your [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org) model to an [online endpoint](concept-endpoints.md) for real-time inference. When you deploy your MLflow model to an online endpoint, you don't need to specify a scoring script or an environmentâ€”this functionality is known as _no-code deployment_.

For no-code-deployment, Azure Machine Learning:

* Dynamically installs Python packages that you list in a conda.yaml file. As a result, dependencies are installed during container runtime.
* Provides an MLflow base image, or curated environment, that contains the following items:
    * The [`azureml-inference-server-http`](how-to-inference-server-http.md) package
    * The [`mlflow-skinny`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/libs/skinny/README_SKINNY.md) package
    * A scoring script for inferencing

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

- A user account that has at least one of the following Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) roles:
  - An Owner role for the Azure Machine Learning workspace
  - A Contributor role for the Azure Machine Learning workspace
  - A custom role that has `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/*` permissions

  For more information, see [Manage access to Azure Machine Learning workspaces](how-to-assign-roles.md).

- Access to Azure Machine Learning:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    Install the Azure CLI and the `ml` extension to the Azure CLI. For installation steps, see [Install and set up the CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md).

    # [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

    Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python.

    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-ml azure-identity
    ```

    # [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

    - Install the MLflow SDK package, `mlflow`, and the Azure Machine Learning integration package for MLflow, `azureml-mlflow`.

        ```bash
        pip install mlflow azureml-mlflow
        ```

    - If you don't run code in an Azure Machine Learning compute instance, configure the MLflow tracking URI or the MLflow registry URI to point to the Azure Machine Learning workspace that you work on. For more information about how to connect MLflow to your workspace, see [Configure MLflow for Azure Machine Learning](how-to-use-mlflow-configure-tracking.md).

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    There are no other prerequisites when you work in Azure Machine Learning studio.

## About the example

The example in this article shows you how to deploy an MLflow model to an online endpoint to perform predictions. The example uses an MLflow model that's based on the [Diabetes dataset](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html). This dataset contains 10 baseline variables: age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and 6 blood serum measurements obtained from 442 diabetes patients. It also contains the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after the date of the baseline data.

The model was trained by using a `scikit-learn` regressor. All the required preprocessing is packaged as a pipeline, so this model is an end-to-end pipeline that goes from raw data to predictions.

The information in this article is based on code samples from the [azureml-examples](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples) repository. If you clone the repository, you can run the commands in this article locally without having to copy or paste YAML files and other files. Use the following commands to clone the repository and go to the folder for your coding language:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli

### Follow along in Jupyter Notebook

To follow along with the steps in this article, see the [Deploy MLflow model to online endpoints](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/mlflow/online-endpoints-deploy-mlflow-model.ipynb) notebook in the examples repository.

### Connect to your workspace

Connect to your Azure Machine Learning workspace:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription <subscription-ID>
az configure --defaults workspace=<workspace-name> group=<resource-group-name> location=<location>
```

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

1. Import the required libraries:

    ```python
    from azure.ai.ml import MLClient, Input
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import (
    ManagedOnlineEndpoint,
    ManagedOnlineDeployment,
    Model,
    Environment,
    CodeConfiguration,
    )
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes
    ```

1. Configure workspace details and get a handle to the workspace:

    ```python
    subscription_id = "<subscription-ID>"
    resource_group = "<resource-group-name>"
    workspace = "<workspace-name>"
    
    ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace)
    ```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

1. Import the required libraries:

    ```python
    import json
    import mlflow
    import requests
    import pandas as pd
    from mlflow.deployments import get_deploy_client
    from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient
    ```

1. Initialize the MLflow client:

    ```python
    mlflow_client = MlflowClient()
    ```

1. Configure the deployment client:

    ```python
    deployment_client = get_deploy_client(mlflow.get_tracking_uri())    
    ```

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

Go to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

### Register the model

You can deploy only registered models to online endpoints. The steps in this article use a model that's trained for the [Diabetes dataset](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html). In this case, you already have a local copy of the model in your cloned repository, so you only need to publish the model to the registry in the workspace. You can skip this step if the model you want to deploy is already registered.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
MODEL_NAME='sklearn-diabetes'
az ml model create --name $MODEL_NAME --type "mlflow_model" --path "endpoints/online/ncd/sklearn-diabetes/model"
```

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

```python
model_name = 'sklearn-diabetes'
model_local_path = "sklearn-diabetes/model"
model = ml_client.models.create_or_update(
        Model(name=model_name, path=model_local_path, type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL)
)
```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

```python
model_name = 'sklearn-diabetes'
model_local_path = "sklearn-diabetes/model"

registered_model = mlflow_client.create_model_version(
    name=model_name, source=f"file://{model_local_path}"
)
version = registered_model.version
```

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

To create a model in Azure Machine Learning studio:

1. In the studio, select __Models__.

1. Select __Register__, and then select the location of your model. For this example, select __From local files__.

1. On the __Upload model__ page, under __Model type__, select __MLflow__.

1. Select __Browse__ to select the model folder, and then select __Next__.

1. On the __Model settings__ page, under __Name__, enter a name for the model, and then select __Next__.

1. On the __Review__ page, review the model files and model settings, and then select __Register__.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints/register-model-in-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review page in the studio. Five uploaded model files are listed, and model settings like the name are visible." lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints/register-model-in-studio.png":::

#### What if your model was logged inside a run?

If your model was logged inside a run, you can register it directly.

To register the model, you need to know its storage location:

- If you use the MLflow `autolog` feature, the path to the model depends on the model type and framework. Check the job output to identify the name of the model folder. This folder contains a file named MLModel.
- If you use the `log_model` method to manually log your models, you pass the path to the model as an argument to that method. For example, if you use `mlflow.sklearn.log_model(my_model, "classifier")` to log the model, `classifier` is the path that the model is stored on.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

You can use the Azure Machine Learning CLI v2 to create a model from training job output. The following code uses the artifacts of a job with ID `$RUN_ID` to register a model named `$MODEL_NAME`. `$MODEL_PATH` is the path that the job uses to store the model.

```bash
az ml model create --name $MODEL_NAME --path azureml://jobs/$RUN_ID/outputs/artifacts/$MODEL_PATH
```

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

You can use the Python SDK to create a model from training job output. The following code uses the artifacts of a job with ID `RUN_ID` to register a model named `sklearn-diabetes`. `MODEL_PATH` is the path that the job uses to store the model.

```python
model_name = 'sklearn-diabetes'

ml_client.models.create_or_update(
    Model(
        path=f"azureml://jobs/{RUN_ID}/outputs/artifacts/{MODEL_PATH}",
        name=model_name,
        type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL
    )
)
```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

You can use the Python MLflow SDK to create a model from training job output. The following code uses the artifacts of a job with ID `RUN_ID` to register a model named `sklearn-diabetes`. `MODEL_PATH` is the path that the job uses to store the model.

```python
model_name = 'sklearn-diabetes'

registered_model = mlflow_client.create_model_version(
    name=model_name, source=f"runs://{RUN_ID}/{MODEL_PATH}"
)
version = registered_model.version
```

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

1. In the studio, select __Jobs__, and go to the job that you want to create a model from.

1. Select the __Output + logs__ tab.

1. Select __Register model__.

1. On the __Select output__ page, take the following steps:
    1. Under __Model type__, select __MLflow__.
    1. Under __Job output__, select the folder that contains the MLModel file.
    1. Select __Next__.

1. On the __Model settings__ page, take the following steps:
    1. Under __Name__, enter the name that you want to use for the registered model.
    1. Select __Next__.

1. On the __Review__ page, review the settings, and then select __Register__. A message appears about the model being created successfully.

## Deploy an MLflow model to an online endpoint

1. Use the following code to configure the name and authentication mode of the endpoint that you want to deploy the model to:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    Set an endpoint name by running the following command. First replace `YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME` with a unique name.

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint-ncd.sh" ID="set_endpoint_name":::

    To configure your endpoint, create a YAML file named create-endpoint.yaml that contains the following lines:

    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/ncd/create-endpoint.yaml":::

    # [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

    ```python
    # To create a unique endpoint name, use a time stamp of the current date and time.
    import datetime

    endpoint_name = "sklearn-diabetes-" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m%d%H%M%f")

    endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(
        name=endpoint_name,
        description="An online endpoint to generate predictions for the diabetes dataset",
        auth_mode="key",
        tags={"env": "dev"},
    )
    ```

    # [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

    You can use a configuration file to configure the properties of the endpoint. In this case, you configure the authentication mode of the endpoint to be `key`.
    
    ```python

    # To create a unique endpoint name, use a time stamp of the current date and time.
    import datetime
    
    endpoint_name = "sklearn-diabetes-" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m%d%H%M%f")

    endpoint_config = {
        "auth_mode": "key",
        "identity": {
            "type": "system_assigned"
        }
    }
    ```

    Use the following code to write this configuration information to a JSON file:

    ```python
    endpoint_config_path = "endpoint_config.json"
    with open(endpoint_config_path, "w") as outfile:
        outfile.write(json.dumps(endpoint_config))
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    You perform this step in the deployment stage.

    ---

1. Create the endpoint:
    
    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint-ncd.sh" ID="create_endpoint":::

    # [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint)
    ```

    # [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

    ```python
    endpoint = deployment_client.create_endpoint(
        name=endpoint_name,
        config={"endpoint-config-file": endpoint_config_path},
    )
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    You perform this step in the deployment stage.

    ---

1. Configure the deployment. A deployment is a set of resources required for hosting the model that does the actual inferencing.
    
    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    Create a YAML file named sklearn-deployment.yaml that contains the following lines:

    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sklearn-deployment.yaml":::

    # [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

    ```python
    blue_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
        name="blue",
        endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
        model=model,
        instance_type="Standard_F4s_v2",
        instance_count=1
    )
    ```

    # [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

    ```python
    blue_deployment_name = "blue"
    ```

    To configure the hardware requirements of your deployment, create a JSON file with the desired configuration:

    ```python
    deploy_config = {
        "instance_type": "Standard_F4s_v2",
        "instance_count": 1,
    }
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > For information about the full specification of this configuration, see [CLI (v2) managed online deployment YAML schema](reference-yaml-deployment-managed-online.md).
    
    Use the following code to write the configuration to a file:

    ```python
    deployment_config_path = "deployment_config.json"
    with open(deployment_config_path, "w") as outfile:
        outfile.write(json.dumps(deploy_config))
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    You perform this step in the deployment stage.

    ---
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Automatic generation of the `scoring_script` and `environment` is only supported for the `PyFunc` model flavor. To use a different model flavor, see [Customize MLflow model deployments](#customize-mlflow-model-deployments).

1. Create the deployment:
    
    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint-ncd.sh" ID="create_sklearn_deployment":::

    ```azurecli
    az ml online-deployment create --name sklearn-deployment --endpoint $ENDPOINT_NAME -f endpoints/online/ncd/sklearn-deployment.yaml --all-traffic
    ```

    # [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

    ```python
    ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment)
    ```

    # [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

    ```python
    blue_deployment = deployment_client.create_deployment(
        name=blue_deployment_name,
        endpoint=endpoint_name,
        model_uri=f"models:/{model_name}/{version}",
        config={"deploy-config-file": deployment_config_path},
    )    
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    1. Select __Endpoints__. Go to the __Real-time endpoints__ tab, and then select __Create__.

        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints/create-from-endpoints.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints/create-from-endpoints.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Endpoints page in the studio. Endpoints and the Create button are highlighted.":::

    1. Select the MLflow model that you registered previously, and then select __Select__.
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > The configuration page includes a note to inform you that the scoring script and environment are automatically generated for your selected MLflow model.

    1. Under __Endpoint__, select __New__ to deploy to a new endpoint.
    
    1. Under __Endpoint name__, enter a name for the endpoint or keep the default name.
    
    1. Under __Deployment name__, enter a name for the deployment or keep the default name.
    
    1. Select __Deploy__ to deploy the model to the endpoint.

        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints/deployment-wizard.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints/deployment-wizard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the studio. Highlighted components include a message about the scoring script and environment being automatically generated.":::

    ---

1. Assign all the traffic to the deployment. So far, the endpoint has one deployment, but none of its traffic is assigned to it.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    This step isn't required in the Azure CLI if you use the `--all-traffic` flag during creation. If you need to change the traffic, you can use the `az ml online-endpoint update --traffic` command. For more information about how to update traffic, see [Progressively update the traffic](how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-progressive.md#progressively-update-the-traffic).
    
    # [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    endpoint.traffic = {"blue": 100}
    ```
    
    # [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

    ```python
    traffic_config = {"traffic": {blue_deployment_name: 100}}
    ```

    Write the configuration to a file:

    ```python
    traffic_config_path = "traffic_config.json"
    with open(traffic_config_path, "w") as outfile:
        outfile.write(json.dumps(traffic_config))
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    This step isn't required in the studio.

    ---

1. Update the endpoint configuration:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    This step isn't required in the Azure CLI if you use the `--all-traffic` flag during creation. If you need to change traffic, you can use the `az ml online-endpoint update --traffic` command. For more information about how to update traffic, see [Progressively update the traffic](how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-progressive.md#progressively-update-the-traffic).
    
    # [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
    ```
    
    # [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

    ```python
    deployment_client.update_endpoint(
        endpoint=endpoint_name,
        config={"endpoint-config-file": traffic_config_path},
    )
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    This step isn't required in the studio.

    ---

## Invoke the endpoint

When your deployment is ready, you can use it to serve requests. One way to test the deployment is by using the built-in invocation capability in your deployment client. In the examples repository, the sample-request-sklearn.json file contains the following JSON code. You can use it as a sample request file for the deployment.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="json" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sample-request-sklearn.json":::

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

:::code language="json" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/mlflow/sample-request-sklearn.json":::

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

:::code language="json" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/mlflow/sample-request-sklearn.json":::

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

:::code language="json" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sample-request-sklearn.json":::

---

> [!NOTE]
> This file uses the `input_data` key instead of `inputs`, which MLflow serving uses. Azure Machine Learning requires a different input format to be able to automatically generate the Swagger contracts for the endpoints. For more information about expected input formats, see [Deployment in the MLflow built-in server vs. deployment in Azure Machine Learning inferencing server](how-to-deploy-mlflow-models.md#models-deployed-in-azure-machine-learning-vs-models-deployed-in-the-mlflow-built-in-server).

Submit a request to the endpoint:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint-ncd.sh" ID="test_sklearn_deployment":::

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

```python
response = ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
    request_file="sample-request-sklearn.json",
)
```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

```python
# Read the sample request that's in the JSON file, and then construct a pandas data frame.
with open("sample-request-sklearn.json", "r") as f:
    sample_request = json.loads(f.read())
    samples = pd.DataFrame(**sample_request["input_data"])

deployment_client.predict(endpoint=endpoint_name, df=samples)
```

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

When you use an MLflow model, you can use the __Test__ tab to create invocations to created endpoints:

1. Select __Endpoints__, and then select the endpoint that you created.

1. Go to the __Test__ tab.

1. In the __Input__ box, paste the contents of the cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sample-request-sklearn.json file.

1. Select __Test__. The output box displays the predictions.

---

The response should be similar to the following text:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```json
[ 
  11633.100167144921,
  8522.117402884991
]
```

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

```json
[ 
  11633.100167144921
]
```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

```json
[ 
  11633.100167144921
]
```

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

```json
[ 
  11633.100167144921,
  8522.117402884991
]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For MLflow no-code-deployment, [testing via local endpoints](how-to-deploy-online-endpoints.md#deploy-and-debug-locally-by-using-a-local-endpoint) isn't currently supported.


## Customize MLflow model deployments

You don't have to specify a scoring script in the deployment definition of an MLflow model to an online endpoint. But you can specify a scoring script if you want to customize your inference process.

You typically want to customize your MLflow model deployment in the following cases:

- The model doesn't have a `PyFunc` flavor.
- You need to customize the way you run the model. For instance, you need to use `mlflow.<flavor>.load_model()` to use a specific flavor to load the model.
- You need to do preprocessing or postprocessing in your scoring routine, because the model doesn't do this processing.
- The output of the model can't be nicely represented in tabular data. For instance, the output is a tensor that represents an image.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you specify a scoring script for an MLflow model deployment, you also have to specify the environment that the deployment runs in.

### Deploy a custom scoring script

To deploy an MLflow model that uses a custom scoring script, take the steps in the following sections.

#### Identify the model folder

Identify the folder that contains your MLflow model by taking the following steps:

1. Go to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

1. Go to the __Models__ section.

1. Select the model that you want to deploy and go to its __Artifacts__ tab.

1. Take note of the folder that's displayed. When you register a model, you specify this folder.

#### Create a scoring script

The following scoring script, score.py, provides an example of how to perform inference with an MLflow model. You can adapt this script to your needs or change any of its parts to reflect your scenario. Notice that the folder name that you previously identified, `model`, is included in the `init()` function.

:::code language="python" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sklearn-diabetes/src/score.py" highlight="14":::

> [!WARNING]
> __MLflow 2.0 advisory__: The example scoring script works with MLflow 1.X and MLflow 2.X. However, the expected input and output formats on those versions can vary. Check your environment definition to see which MLflow version you use. MLflow 2.0 is only supported in Python 3.8 and later versions.

#### Create an environment

The next step is to create an environment that you can run the scoring script in. Because the model is an MLflow model, the conda requirements are also specified in the model package. For more information about the files included in an MLflow model, see [The MLmodel format](concept-mlflow-models.md#the-mlmodel-format). You build the environment by using the conda dependencies from the file. However, you need to also include the `azureml-inference-server-http` package, which is required for online deployments in Azure Machine Learning.
    
You can create a conda definition file named conda.yaml that contains the following lines:

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sklearn-diabetes/environment/conda.yaml":::

> [!NOTE]
> The `dependencies` section of this conda file includes the `azureml-inference-server-http` package.

Use this conda dependencies file to create the environment:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
The environment is created inline in the deployment configuration.
    
# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)
    
```python
environment = Environment(
    conda_file="sklearn-diabetes/environment/conda.yaml",
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu22.04:latest",
)
```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

This operation isn't supported in the MLflow SDK.

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

1. Select __Environments__.
    
1. Go to the __Custom environments__ tab, and then select __Create__.
    
1. On the __Settings__ page, take the following steps:
    1. Under __Name__, enter the name of the environment. In this case, enter __sklearn-mlflow-online-py37__.
    1. Under __Select environment source__, select __Use existing docker image with optional conda file__.
    1. Under __Container registry image path__, enter __mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu22.04__.
    1. Select __Next__ to go to the __Customize__ section.

1. Copy the contents of the sklearn-diabetes/environment/conda.yaml file and paste it in the text box.

1. Select __Next__ to go to the __Tags__ page, and then select __Next__ again.

1. On the __Review__ page, select __Create__. The environment is ready for use.

#### Create the deployment

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

In the endpoints/online/ncd folder, create a deployment configuration file, deployment.yml, that contains the following lines:

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineDeployment.schema.json
name: sklearn-diabetes-custom
endpoint_name: my-endpoint
model: azureml:sklearn-diabetes@latest
environment: 
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu22.04
    conda_file: sklearn-diabetes/environment/conda.yaml
code_configuration:
    code: sklearn-diabetes/src
    scoring_script: score.py
instance_type: Standard_F2s_v2
instance_count: 1
```

Create the deployment:

```azurecli
az ml online-deployment create -f endpoints/online/ncd/deployment.yml
```
    
# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)
    
```python
blue_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="blue",
    endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
    model=model,
    environment=environment,
    code_configuration=CodeConfiguration(
        code="sklearn-diabetes/src",
        scoring_script="score.py"
    ),
    instance_type="Standard_F4s_v2",
    instance_count=1,
)

ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment)

```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

This operation isn't supported in the MLflow SDK.

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

To create the deployment, take the steps in the following sections.

##### Configure initial settings

1. On the __Endpoints__ page, Select __Create__.

1. Select the MLflow model that you registered previously, and then select __Select__.

1. In the endpoint creation wizard, select __More options__ to go to advanced options.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints/select-advanced-deployment-options.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints/select-advanced-deployment-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an endpoint configuration page in the studio. The More options button is highlighted."::: 

1. Enter a name and authentication type for the endpoint, and then select __Next__.

#### Serve requests

When your deployment is complete, it's ready to serve requests. One way to test the deployment is to use the `invoke` method with a sample request file such as the following file, sample-request-sklearn.json:
    
# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="json" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sample-request-sklearn.json":::

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

:::code language="json" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/mlflow/sample-request-sklearn.json":::

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

This operation isn't supported in the MLflow SDK.

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

:::code language="json" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sample-request-sklearn.json":::

---

Submit a request to the endpoint:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint-ncd.sh" ID="test_sklearn_deployment":::

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

```python
response = ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
    deployment_name=deployment.name,
    request_file="sample-request-sklearn.json",
)
```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

This operation isn't supported in the MLflow SDK.

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

1. Select __Endpoints__, and then select the endpoint that you created.

1. Go to the __Test__ tab.

1. In the __Input__ box, paste the contents of the cli/endpoints/online/ncd/sample-request-sklearn.json file.

1. Select __Test__.

1. The output box displays the predictions.

---

The response should be similar to the following text:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```json
{
    "predictions": [ 
    1095.2797413413252,
    1134.585328803727
    ]
}
```

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

```json
{
    "predictions": [ 
    1095.2797413413252
    ]
}
```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

This operation isn't supported in the MLflow SDK.

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

```json
{
    "predictions": [ 
    1095.2797413413252,
    1134.585328803727
    ]
}
```

---

> [!WARNING]
> __MLflow 2.0 advisory__: In MLflow 1.X, the response doesn't contain the `predictions` key.


## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the endpoint, delete its associated resources:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint-ncd.sh" ID="delete_endpoint":::

# [Python (Azure Machine Learning SDK)](#tab/sdk)

```python
ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_delete(endpoint_name)
```

# [Python (MLflow SDK)](#tab/mlflow)

```python
deployment_client.delete_endpoint(endpoint_name)
```

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

1. In the studio, select __Endpoints__.

1. Go to the __Real-time endpoints__ tab.

1. Select the endpoint that you want to delete.

1. Select __Delete__. The endpoint and its deployments are deleted.
