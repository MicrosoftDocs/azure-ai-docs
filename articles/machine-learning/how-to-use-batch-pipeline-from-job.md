# Deploy existing pipeline jobs to batch endpoints

[!INCLUDE [ml v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

Batch endpoints allow you to deploy pipeline components, providing a convenient way to operationalize pipelines in Azure Machine Learning. Batch endpoints accept pipeline components for deployment. However, if you already have a pipeline job that runs successfully, Azure Machine Learning can accept that job as input to your batch endpoint and create the pipeline component automatically for you. In this article, you'll learn how to use your existing pipeline job as input for batch deployment.

You'll learn to:

> * Run and create the pipeline job that you want to deploy
> * Create a batch deployment from the existing job
> * Test the deployment

## About this example

In this example, we're going to deploy a pipeline consisting of a simple command job that prints "hello world!". Instead of registering the pipeline component before deployment, we indicate an existing pipeline job to use for deployment. Azure Machine Learning will then create the pipeline component automatically and deploy it as a batch endpoint pipeline component deployment.

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-batch-clone](includes/azureml-batch-clone-samples.md)]

The files for this example are in:

```azurecli
cd endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch
```

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-batch-prereqs](includes/azureml-batch-prereqs.md)]

## Run the pipeline job you want to deploy

In this section, we begin by running a pipeline job:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

The following `pipeline-job.yml` file contains the configuration for the pipeline job:

__pipeline-job.yml__

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/pipeline-job.yml" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

Load the pipeline component and instantiate it:

```python
hello_batch = load_component(source="hello-component/hello.yml")
pipeline_job = hello_batch()
```

Now, configure some run settings to run the test. This article assumes you have a compute cluster named `batch-cluster`. You can replace the cluster with the name of yours.

```python
pipeline_job.settings.default_compute = "batch-cluster"
pipeline_job.settings.default_datastore = "workspaceblobstore"
```

---

Create the pipeline job:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deploy-and-run.sh" ID="run_pipeline_job_deployment" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
pipeline_job_run = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(
    pipeline_job, experiment_name="hello-batch-pipeline"
)
pipeline_job_run
```

---

## Create a batch endpoint

Before we deploy the pipeline job, we need to deploy a batch endpoint to host the deployment.

1. Provide a name for the endpoint. A batch endpoint's name needs to be unique in each region since the name is used to construct the invocation URI. To ensure uniqueness, append any trailing characters to the name specified in the following code.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deploy-and-run.sh" ID="name_endpoint" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    endpoint_name="hello-batch"
    ```

1. Configure the endpoint:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    The `endpoint.yml` file contains the endpoint's configuration.

    __endpoint.yml__
    
    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/endpoint.yml" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    endpoint = BatchEndpoint(
        name=endpoint_name,
        description="A hello world endpoint for component deployments",
    )
    ```

1. Create the endpoint:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deploy-and-run.sh" ID="create_endpoint" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    ml_client.batch_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
    ```

1. Query the endpoint URI:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deploy-and-run.sh" ID="query_endpoint" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    endpoint = ml_client.batch_endpoints.get(name=endpoint_name)
    print(endpoint)
    ```

## Deploy the pipeline job

To deploy the pipeline component, we have to create a batch deployment from the existing job.

1. We need to tell Azure Machine Learning the name of the job that we want to deploy. In our case, that job is indicated in the following variable:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    ```azurecli
    echo $JOB_NAME
    ```
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    print(job.name)
    ```

1. Configure the deployment.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    The `deployment-from-job.yml` file contains the deployment's configuration. Notice how we use the key `job_definition` instead of `component` to indicate that this deployment is created from a pipeline job:

    __deployment-from-job.yml__

    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deployment-from-job.yml" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)

    Notice now how we use the property `job_definition` instead of `component`:
    
    ```python
    deployment = PipelineComponentBatchDeployment(
        name="hello-batch-from-job",
        description="A hello world deployment with a single step. This deployment is created from a pipeline job.",
        endpoint_name=endpoint.name,
        job_definition=pipeline_job_run,
        settings={
            "default_compute": "batch-cluster",
            "continue_on_step_failure": False
        }
    )
    ```

    ---

    > [!TIP]
    > This configuration assumes you have a compute cluster named `batch-cluster`. You can replace this value with the name of your cluster.
    
1. Create the deployment:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    Run the following code to create a batch deployment under the batch endpoint and set it as the default deployment.
    
    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deploy-and-run.sh" ID="create_deployment_from_job" :::
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Notice the use of `--set job_definition=azureml:$JOB_NAME`. Since job names are unique, the command `--set` is used here to change the name of the job when you run it in your workspace.

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    This command starts the deployment creation and returns a confirmation response while the deployment creation continues.

    ```python
    ml_client.batch_deployments.begin_create_or_update(deployment).result()
    ```
    
    Once created, let's configure this new deployment as the default one:

    ```python
    endpoint = ml_client.batch_endpoints.get(endpoint.name)
    endpoint.defaults.deployment_name = deployment.name
    ml_client.batch_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
    ```

1. Your deployment is ready for use.

### Test the deployment

Once the deployment is created, it's ready to receive jobs. You can invoke the default deployment as follows:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deploy-and-run.sh" ID="invoke_deployment_inline" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
job = ml_client.batch_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=endpoint.name, 
)
```

---

You can monitor the progress of the show and stream the logs using:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deploy-and-run.sh" ID="stream_job_logs" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
ml_client.jobs.get(name=job.name)
```

To wait for the job to finish, run the following code:

```python
ml_client.jobs.stream(name=job.name)
```
---

## Clean up resources

Once you're done, delete the associated resources from the workspace:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Run the following code to delete the batch endpoint and its underlying deployment. `--yes` is used to confirm the deletion.

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/hello-batch/deploy-and-run.sh" ID="delete_endpoint" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

Delete the endpoint:

```python
ml_client.batch_endpoints.begin_delete(endpoint.name).result()
```
