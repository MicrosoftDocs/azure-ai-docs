# What is Foundry Local?

Foundry Local is an on-device AI inference solution offering performance, privacy, customization, and cost advantages. It integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows and applications through an intuitive CLI and REST API.

## Key features

- **On-Device Inference**: Run models locally on your own hardware, reducing your costs while keeping all your data on your device.

- **Model Customization**: Select from preset models or use your own to meet specific requirements and use cases.

- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminate recurring cloud service costs by using your existing hardware, making AI more accessible.

- **Seamless Integration**: Connect with your applications through API endpoints or the CLI, with easy scaling to Azure AI Foundry as your needs grow.

## Use cases

Foundry Local is ideal for scenarios where:

- You want to keep sensitive data on your device.
- You need to operate in environments with limited or no internet connectivity.
- You want to reduce cloud inference costs.
- You need low-latency AI responses for real-time applications.
- You want to experiment with AI models before deploying to a cloud environment.

## Do I need an Azure subscription?

No - Foundry Local doesn't require an Azure subscription. It runs on your local hardware, allowing you to use your existing infrastructure without the need for cloud services.
