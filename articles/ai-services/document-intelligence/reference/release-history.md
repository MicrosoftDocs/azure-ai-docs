* [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio) June release is the latest update to the Document Intelligence Studio. There are considerable user experience and accessibility improvements addressed in this update:

  * **Code sample for JavaScript and C#**. The Studio code tab now adds JavaScript and C# code samples in addition to the existing Python one.
  * **New document upload UI**. Studio now supports uploading a document with drag & drop into the new upload user interface.
  * **New feature for custom projects**. Custom projects now support creating storage account and blobs when configuring the project. In addition, custom project now supports uploading training files directly within the Studio and copying the existing custom model.

* Document Intelligence v3.0 **2022-06-30-preview** release presents extensive updates across the feature APIs:

  * [**Layout extends structure extraction**](../prebuilt/layout.md). Layout now includes added structure elements including sections, section headers, and paragraphs. This update enables finer grain document segmentation scenarios. For a complete list of structure elements identified, _see_ [enhanced structure](../prebuilt/layout.md#data-extraction).
  * [**Custom neural model tabular fields support**](../train/custom-neural.md). Custom document models now support tabular fields. Tabular fields by default are also multi page. To learn more about tabular fields in custom neural models, _see_ [tabular fields](../train/custom-neural.md#tabular-fields).
  * [**Custom template model tabular fields support for cross page tables**](../train/custom-template.md). Custom form models now support tabular fields across pages. To learn more about tabular fields in custom template models, _see_ [tabular fields](../train/custom-neural.md#tabular-fields).
  * [**Invoice model output now includes general document key-value pairs**](../prebuilt/invoice.md). Where invoices contain required fields beyond the fields included in the prebuilt model, the general document model supplements the output with key-value pairs. _See_ [key value pairs](../prebuilt/invoice.md#key-value-pairs).
  * [**Invoice language expansion**](../prebuilt/invoice.md). The invoice model includes expanded language support. _See_ [supported languages](../prebuilt/invoice.md#supported-languages-and-locales).
  * [**Prebuilt business card**](../prebuilt/business-card.md) now includes Japanese language support. _See_ [supported languages](../prebuilt/business-card.md#supported-languages-and-locales).
  * [**Prebuilt ID document model**](../prebuilt/id-document.md). The ID document model now extracts DateOfIssue, Height, Weight, EyeColor, HairColor, and DocumentDiscriminator from US driver's licenses. _See_ [field extraction](../prebuilt/id-document.md).
  * [**Read model now supports common Microsoft Office document types**](../prebuilt/read.md). Document types like Word (docx), Excel (xlsx), and PowerPoint (pptx) are now supported with the Read API. See [Read data extraction](../prebuilt/read.md#data-extraction).
