# Error guide v4.0, v3.1, and v3.0

Document Intelligence uses a unified design to represent all errors encountered in the REST APIs. Whenever an API operation returns a 4xx or 5xx status code, additional information about the error is returned in the response JSON body as follows:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "InvalidRequest",
    "message": "Invalid request.",
    "innererror": {
      "code": "InvalidContent",
      "message": "The file format is unsupported or corrupted. Refer to documentation for the list of supported formats."
    }
  }
}
```

For long-running operations where multiple errors are encountered, the top-level error code is set to the most severe error, with the individual errors listed under the *error.details* property. In such scenarios, the *target* property of each individual error specifies the trigger of the error.

```json
{
    "status": "failed",
    "createdDateTime": "2021-07-14T10:17:51Z",
    "lastUpdatedDateTime": "2021-07-14T10:17:51Z",
    "error": {
        "code": "InternalServerError",
        "message": "An unexpected error occurred.",
        "details": [
            {
                "code": "InternalServerError",
                "message": "An unexpected error occurred."
            },
            {
                "code": "InvalidContentDimensions",
                "message": "The input image dimensions are out of range. Refer to documentation for supported image dimensions.",
                "target": "2"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The top-level *error.code* property can be one of the following error code messages:

| Error Code           | Message                                                | Http Status |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| InvalidRequest       | Invalid request.                                       | 400         |
| InvalidArgument      | Invalid argument.                                      | 400         |
| Forbidden            | Access forbidden due to policy or other configuration. | 403         |
| NotFound             | Resource not found.                                    | 404         |
| MethodNotAllowed     | The requested HTTP method isn't allowed.              | 405         |
| Conflict             | The request couldn't be completed due to a conflict.  | 409         |
| UnsupportedMediaType | Request content type isn't supported.                 | 415         |
| InternalServerError  | An unexpected error occurred.                          | 500         |
| ServiceUnavailable   | A transient error occurred. Try again.      | 503         |

When possible, more details are specified in the *inner error* property.
