[Reference documentation](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.formrecognizer-readme) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/src) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).
- The [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or current version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
- An Azure Storage blob that contains a set of training data. See [Build and train a custom model](../../build-a-custom-model.md?view=doc-intel-2.1.0&preserve-view=true) for tips and options for putting together your training data set. For this project, you can use the files under the *Train* folder of the [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451). Download and extract *sample_data.zip*.
- <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer" title="Create a Document Intelligence resource."  target="_blank">An Intelligence resource</a>. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
- The key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Azure Document Intelligence service.

  1. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource**.
  1. In the left navigation menu, select **Keys and Endpoint**.
  1. Copy one of the keys and the **Endpoint** for use later in this article.

  :::image type="content" source="../../../media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of keys and endpoint location in the Azure portal.":::

## Set up your programming environment

In a console window, use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `formrecognizer-project`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: *program.cs*.

```console
dotnet new console -n formrecognizer-project
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with the following command:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors.

```output
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

### Install the client library

Within the application directory, install the Document Intelligence client library for .NET with the following command:

```console
dotnet add package Azure.AI.FormRecognizer --version 3.1.1
```

From the project directory, open the *Program.cs* file in an editor or IDE. Add the following `using` directives:

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_using)]

In the application's `Program` class, create variables for your resource's key and endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal. If the Document Intelligence resource you created in the Prerequisites section deployed successfully, select the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. In the left navigation menu, under **Resource Management**, select **Keys and Endpoint**.
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done. Never post it publicly. For production, use secure methods to store and access your credentials. For more information, see [Azure AI services security](../../../../../ai-services/security-features.md).

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_creds)]

In the application's `Main` method, add a call to the asynchronous tasks used in this project:

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_main)]

## Use the Object model

With Document Intelligence, you can create two different client types. The first, `FormRecognizerClient`, queries the service to recognize form fields and content. The second, `FormTrainingClient`, creates and manages custom models to improve recognition.

`FormRecognizerClient` provides the following operations:

- Recognize form fields and content by using custom models trained to analyze your custom forms. These values are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. See [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model).
- Recognize form content, including tables, lines, and words, without the need to train a model.  Form content is returned in a collection of `FormPage` objects. See [Analyze layout](#analyze-layout).
- Recognize common fields from US receipts, business cards, invoices, and ID documents using a pretrained model on the Document Intelligence service.

`FormTrainingClient` provides operations to:

- Train custom models to analyze all fields and values found in your custom forms.  A `CustomFormModel` is returned that indicates the form types the model analyzes and the fields it extracts for each form type.
- Train custom models to analyze specific fields and values you specify by labeling your custom forms. A `CustomFormModel` is returned that indicates the fields that the model extracts and the estimated accuracy for each field.
- Manage models created in your account.
- Copy a custom model from one Document Intelligence resource to another.

For examples, see [Train a Model](#train-a-custom-model) and [Manage Custom Models](#manage-custom-models).

> [!NOTE]
> Models can also be trained using a graphical user interface such as the [Sample Labeling Tool](../../../label-tool.md).

## Authenticate the client

Under `Main`, create a method named `AuthenticateClient`. Use this method in other tasks to authenticate your requests to the Document Intelligence service. This method uses the `AzureKeyCredential` object, so that if needed, you can update the key without creating new client objects.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_auth)]

Repeat the steps for a new method that authenticates a training client.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_auth_training)]

## Get assets for testing

You also need to add references to the URLs for your training and testing data. Add these references to the root of your `Program` class.

1. To retrieve the SAS URL for your custom model training data, go to your storage resource in the Azure portal and select **Data storage** > **Containers**.
1. Navigate to your container, right-click, and select **Generate SAS**.

   Get the SAS for your container, not for the storage account itself.

1. Make sure the **Read**, **Write**, **Delete**, and **List** permissions are selected, and select **Generate SAS token and URL**.
1. Copy the value in the **URL** section to a temporary location. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.

Repeat the previous steps to get the SAS URL of an individual document in the blob storage container. Save that SAS URL to a temporary location as well.

Save the URL of the included sample image. That image is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/sample_forms)).

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_urls)]

## Analyze layout

You can use Document Intelligence to analyze tables, lines, and words in documents, without needing to train a model. The returned value is a collection of **FormPage** objects. There's one object for each page in the submitted document. For more information about layout extraction, see [Document Intelligence layout model](../../../prebuilt/layout.md).

To analyze the content of a file at a given URL, use the `StartRecognizeContentFromUri` method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_getcontent_call)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also get content from a local file. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient) methods, such as `StartRecognizeContent`. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios that involve local images.

The rest of this task prints the content information to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_getcontent_print)]

The result looks like the following output.

```output
Form Page 1 has 18 lines.
    Line 0 has 1 word, and text: 'Contoso'.
    Line 1 has 1 word, and text: 'Address:'.

```

## Analyze receipts

This section demonstrates how to analyze and extract common fields from US receipts by using a pretrained receipt model. For more information about receipt analysis, see the [Document Intelligence receipt model](../../../prebuilt/receipt.md).

To analyze receipts from a URL, use the `StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri` method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_receipt_call)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze local receipt images. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient) methods, such as `StartRecognizeReceipts`. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios that involve local images.

The returned value is a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. There's one object for each page in the submitted document. The following code processes the receipt at the given URI and prints the major fields and values to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_receipt_print)]

The result looks like the following output.

```output

## Analyze business cards

This section demonstrates how to analyze and extract common fields from English business cards by using a pretrained model. For more information about business card analysis, see the [Document Intelligence business card model](../../../concept-business-card.md).

To analyze business cards from a URL, use the `StartRecognizeBusinessCardsFromUriAsync` method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_bc_call)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze local business card images. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient) methods, such as `StartRecognizeBusinessCards`. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios that involve local images.

The following code processes the business card at the given URI and prints the major fields and values to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_bc_print)]

## Analyze invoices

This section demonstrates how to analyze and extract common fields from sales invoices by using a pretrained model. For more information about invoice analysis, see the [Document Intelligence invoice model](../../../prebuilt/invoice.md).

To analyze invoices from a URL, use the `StartRecognizeInvoicesFromUriAsync` method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_invoice_call)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze local invoice images. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient) methods, such as `StartRecognizeInvoices`. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios that involve local images.

The following code processes the invoice at the given URI and prints the major fields and values to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_invoice_print)]

## Analyze ID documents

This section demonstrates how to analyze and extract key information from government-issued identification documents—worldwide passports and U.S. driver's licenses by using the Document Intelligence prebuilt ID model. For more information about ID document analysis, see the [Document Intelligence ID document model](../../../prebuilt/id-document.md).

To analyze ID documents from a URI, use the `StartRecognizeIdentityDocumentsFromUriAsync` method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_id_call)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze local ID document images. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient) methods, such as `StartRecognizeIdentityDocumentsAsync`. Also, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios that involve local images.

The following code processes the ID document at the given URI and prints the major fields and values to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_id_print)]

## Train a custom model

This section demonstrates how to train a model with your own data. A trained model can output structured data that includes the key/value relationships in the original document. After you train the model, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to reliably extract data from more forms according to your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also train models with a graphical user interface such as the [Document Intelligence Sample Labeling tool](../../../label-tool.md).

### Train a model without labels

Train custom models to analyze all the fields and values found in your custom forms without manually labeling the training documents. The following method trains a model on a given set of documents and prints the model's status to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_train)]

The returned `CustomFormModel` object contains information on the form types the model can analyze and the fields it can extract from each form type. The following code block prints this information to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_train_response)]

Finally, return the trained model ID for use in later steps.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_train_return)]

### Train a model with labels

You can also train custom models by manually labeling the training documents. Training with labels leads to better performance in some scenarios. To train with labels, you need to have special label information files (*\<filename>.pdf.labels.json*) in your blob storage container alongside the training documents. The [Document Intelligence Sample Labeling tool](../../../label-tool.md) provides a user interface to help you create these label files. After you get them, you can call the `StartTrainingAsync` method with the `uselabels` parameter set to `true`.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_trainlabels)]

The returned `CustomFormModel` indicates the fields that the model can extract, along with its estimated accuracy in each field. The following code block prints this information to the console.

## Analyze forms with a custom model

This section demonstrates how to extract key/value information and other content from your custom template types by using models you trained with your own forms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to implement this scenario, you must have already trained a model so you can pass its ID into the following method.

Use the `StartRecognizeCustomFormsFromUri` method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_analyze)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze a local file. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient) methods, such as `StartRecognizeCustomForms`. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios that involve local images.

The returned value is a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. There's one object for each page in the submitted document. The following code prints the analysis results to the console. It prints each recognized field and corresponding value, along with a confidence score.

## Manage custom models

This section demonstrates how to manage the custom models stored in your account. You complete multiple operations within the following method:

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage)]

### Check the number of models in the FormRecognizer resource account

The following code block checks how many models you've saved in your Document Intelligence account and compares it to the account limit.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage_model_count)]

### Output

```output
Account has 20 models.
It can have at most 5000 models.
```

### List the models currently stored in the resource account

The following code blocklists the current models in your account and prints their details to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage_model_list)]

This output has been truncated for readability.

```

### Get a specific model using the model's ID

The following code block trains a new model, just like in [Train a model without labels](#train-a-model-without-labels) and then retrieves a second reference to it using its ID.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage_model_get)]

    FieldName: Subtotal
    FieldName: Tax
    FieldName: Total
    FieldName: VendorName
    FieldName: Website
...
```

### Delete a model from the resource account

You can also delete a model from your account by referencing its ID. This step also closes out the method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage_model_delete)]

## Run the application

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure portal](../../../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)

## Troubleshooting

When you interact with the Azure AI Document Intelligence client library using the .NET SDK, errors returned by the service result in a `RequestFailedException`. They include the same HTTP status code that a REST API request would return.

For example, if you submit a receipt image with an invalid URI, a `400` error is returned, indicating *Bad Request*.

```csharp
try
{
    RecognizedReceiptCollection receipts = await client.StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri(new Uri(receiptUri)).WaitForCompletionAsync();
}
catch (RequestFailedException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
}
```

You notice that additional information, like the client request ID of the operation, is logged.

```output

Message:
    Azure.RequestFailedException: Service request failed.
    Status: 400 (Bad Request)

Content:
    {"error":{"code":"FailedToDownloadImage","innerError":
    {"requestId":"8ca04feb-86db-4552-857c-fde903251518"},
    "message":"Failed to download image from input URL."}}
