## Set your environment variables

To interact with the Document Intelligence service, you need to create an instance of the `DocumentAnalysisClient` class. To do so, instantiate the client with your `key` and `endpoint` from the Azure portal. For this project, use environment variables to store and access credentials.

[!INCLUDE [Azure key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-services/security/azure-key-vault.md)]

To set the environment variable for your Document Intelligence resource key, open a console window, and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment. Replace *\<yourKey>* and *\<yourEndpoint>* with the values from your resource in the Azure portal.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

Environment variables in Windows aren't case-sensitive. They're typically declared in uppercase, with words joined by an underscore. At a command prompt, run the following commands:

1. Set your key variable:

   ```console
   setx DI_KEY <yourKey>
   ```

1. Set your endpoint variable

   ```console
   setx DI_ENDPOINT <yourEndpoint>
   ```

1. Close the Command Prompt window after you set your environment variables. The values remain until you change them again.

1. Restart any running programs that read the environment variable. For example, if you're using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code as your editor, restart before running the sample code.

Here are a few more helpful commands to use with environment variables:

| Command | Action | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `setx VARIABLE_NAME=` | Delete the environment variable by setting the value to an empty string.| `setx DI_KEY=` |
| `setx VARIABLE_NAME=value` | Set or change the value of an environment variable.| `setx DI_KEY=<yourKey>`|
| `set VARIABLE_NAME` | Display the value of a specific environment variable.| `set  DI_KEY` |
| `set`| Display all environment variables.| `set`|

#### [macOS](#tab/macOS)

Environment variables in macOS are case-sensitive. Conventionally, the variable name is declared in uppercase letters.

The `export` command sets the variable and exports it to the global environment, which is available to other processes. However, the value is temporary and lasts only until you close the terminal session. Open your terminal and enter the following commands:

1. Set your key variable:

   ```bash
   export key=<yourKey>
   ```

1. Set your endpoint variable:

   ```bash
   export endpoint=<yourEndpoint>
   ```

To set an environment variable permanently, place an export command in your Bash  `~/.bash_profile` startup script:

  1. Use a text editor to open the *~/.bash_profile* file and add the following command to create a permanent environment variable:

     ```bash
     export DI_KEY=<yourKey> DI_ENDPOINT=<yourEndpoint>
     ```

     Example: `export DI_KEY="<yourKey>"`

  1. Save your changes to the *bash_profile* file.

  1. To make the changes effective, run the following command from your terminal window:

     ```bash
     source ~/.bash-profile
     ```

Here are a few more helpful commands to use with environment variables:

| Command | Action | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `unset VARIABLE_NAME` | Delete an environment variable.| `unset DI_KEY` |
| `export VARIABLE_NAME=value` | Set or change the value of a temporary environment variable.| `export DI_KEY=<yourKey>` |
| `printenv VARIABLE_NAME`</br>`echo $VARIABLE_NAME`| Display the value of a specific environment variable. With the `echo` command, precede the variable with `$`.| `printenv DI_KEY` </br>`echo $DI_KEY`|
| `printenv` | Display all environment variables.| `printenv` |

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

Environment variables in Linux are case-sensitive. Conventionally, the variable name is declared in uppercase letters.

The `export` command sets the variable and exports it to the global environment, which is available to other processes. However, the value is temporary and lasts only until you close the terminal session:

1. Set your key variable:

   ```bash
   export DI_KEY=<yourKey>
   ```

1. Set your endpoint variable:

   ```bash
   export DI_ENDPOINT=<yourEndpoint>
   ```

To set an environment variable permanently, place an export command in your Bash `~/.bashrc` startup script:

  1. Use a text editor to open the *~/.bashrc* file and add the following command to create a permanent environment variable:

     ```bash
     export <VARIABLE>=<value>
     ```

     Example: `export DI_KEY=<yourKey>`

  1. Save your changes to the *.bashrc* file.

  1. To make the changes effective, run the following command from your terminal window:

     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

Here are a few more helpful commands to use with environment variables:

| Command | Action | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `unset VARIABLE_NAME`| Delete an environment variable.|`unset DI_KEY=` |
| `export VARIABLE_NAME=value` | Set or change the value of a temporary environment variable.| `export DI_KEY={yourKey}`|
| `printenv VARIABLE_NAME`</br>`echo $VARIABLE_NAME`| Display the value of an environment variable. With the `echo` command, precede the variable with `$`.| `printenv DI_KEY` </br>`echo $DI_KEY`|
| `printenv`| Display all environment variables.|`printenv`|
