# Document Intelligence mortgage document models

**This content applies to:** ![checkmark](../media/yes-icon.png) **v4.0 (preview)** ![checkmark](../media/yes-icon.png)

The Document Intelligence Mortgage models use powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities and deep learning models to analyze and extract key fields from mortgage documents. Mortgage documents can be of various formats and quality. The API analyzes mortgage documents and returns a structured JSON data representation. The models currently support English-language documents only.

**Supported document types:**

* Uniform Residential Loan Application (Form 1003)
* Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (Form 1004)
* Verification of employment form (Form 1005)
* Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Summary (Form 1008)
* Closing Disclosure form
