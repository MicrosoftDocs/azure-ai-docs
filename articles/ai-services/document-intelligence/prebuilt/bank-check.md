# Document Intelligence bank check model

The Document Intelligence bank check model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extract data from US bank statements. The API analyzes printed checks; extracts key information, and returns a structured JSON data representation.

## Check data extraction

A check is a secure way to transfer amount from payee's account to receiver's account. Businesses use check to pay their vendors as a signed document to instruct the bank for payment. See how data, including check details, account details, amount, memo, is extracted from bank statement US. You need the following resources:

* An Azure subscriptionâ€”you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Document Intelligence instance](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your key and endpoint.
