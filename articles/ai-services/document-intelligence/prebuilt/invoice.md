The Document Intelligence invoice model uses powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities to analyze and extract key fields and line items from sales invoices, utility bills, and purchase orders. Invoices can be of various formats and quality including phone-captured images, scanned documents, and digital PDFs. The API analyzes invoice text; extracts key information such as customer name, billing address, due date, and amount due; and returns a structured JSON data representation. The model currently supports invoices in 27 languages.

**Supported document types:**

* Invoices
* Utility bills
* Sales orders
* Purchase orders

## Automated invoice processing

Automated invoice processing is the process of extracting key `accounts payable` fields from billing account documents. Extracted data includes line items from invoices integrated with your accounts payable (AP) workflows for reviews and payments. Historically, the accounts payable process is performed manually and, hence, very time consuming. Accurate extraction of key data from invoices is typically the first and one of the most critical steps in the invoice automation process.

## Invoice model data extraction

See how data, including customer information, vendor details, and line items, is extracted from invoices. You need the following resources:

* An Azure subscription—you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).

* A [Document Intelligence instance](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your key and endpoint.

 :::image type="content" source="../media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of keys and endpoint location in the Azure portal.":::

::: moniker range=">=doc-intel-3.0.0"

1. On the [Document Intelligence Studio home page](https://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com/studio), select **Invoices**.

1. You can analyze the sample invoice or upload your own files.

1. Select the **Run analysis** button and, if necessary, configure the **Analyze options** :

## Supported languages and locales

For a complete list of supported languages, *see* our [prebuilt model language support](../language-support/prebuilt.md) page.

## Field extraction


:::moniker range=">=doc-intel-3.1.0"

* For supported document extraction fields, refer to the [invoice model schema](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/document-intelligence-code-samples/blob/main/schema/2024-07-31-preview/invoice.md) page in our GitHub sample repository.

* The invoice key-value pairs and line items extracted are in the `documentResults` section of the JSON output.


### Key-value pairs

The prebuilt invoice **2022-06-30** and later releases support the optional return of key-value pairs. By default, the return of key-value pairs is disabled. Key-value pairs are specific spans within the invoice that identify a label or key and its associated response or value. In an invoice, these pairs could be the label and the value the user entered for that field or telephone number. The AI model is trained to extract identifiable keys and values based on a wide variety of document types, formats, and structures.

Keys can also exist in isolation when the model detects that a key exists, with no associated value or when processing optional fields. For example, a middle name field can be left blank on a form in some instances. Key-value pairs are always spans of text contained in the document. For documents where the same value is described in different ways, for example, customer/user, the associated key is either customer or user (based on context).

### JSON output

The JSON output has three parts:

* `"readResults"` node contains all of the recognized text and selection marks. Text is organized via page, then by line, then by individual words.
* `"pageResults"` node contains the tables and cells extracted with their bounding boxes, confidence, and a reference to the lines and words in *readResults*.
* `"documentResults"` node contains the invoice-specific values and line items that the model discovered. It's where to find all the fields from the invoice such as invoice ID, ship to, bill to, customer, total, line items and lots more.
