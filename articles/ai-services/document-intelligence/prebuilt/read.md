Document Intelligence Read Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model runs at a higher resolution than Azure AI Vision Read and extracts print and handwritten text from PDF documents and scanned images. It also includes support for extracting text from Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and HTML documents. It detects paragraphs, text lines, words, locations, and languages. The Read model is the underlying OCR engine for other Document Intelligence prebuilt models like Layout, General Document, Invoice, Receipt, Identity (ID) document, Health insurance card, W2 in addition to custom models.

## What is Optical Character Recognition?

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for documents is optimized for large text-heavy documents in multiple file formats and global languages. It includes features like higher-resolution scanning of document images for better handling of smaller and dense text; paragraph detection; and fillable form management. OCR capabilities also include advanced scenarios like single character boxes and accurate extraction of key fields commonly found in invoices, receipts, and other prebuilt scenarios.

## Development options (v4)

Document Intelligence v4.0 (2024-07-31-preview) supports the following tools, applications, and libraries:

| Feature | Resources | Model ID |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
|**Read OCR model**|&bullet; [**Document Intelligence Studio**](https://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com)</br>&bullet;  [**REST API**](/rest/api/aiservices/operation-groups?view=rest-aiservices-v4.0%20(2024-07-31-preview)&preserve-view=true)</br>&bullet;  [**C# SDK**](../quickstarts/get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&preserve-view=true)</br>&bullet;  [**Python SDK**](../quickstarts/get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&preserve-view=true)</br>&bullet;  [**Java SDK**](../quickstarts/get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&preserve-view=true)</br>&bullet;  [**JavaScript SDK**](../quickstarts/get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&preserve-view=true)|**prebuilt-read**|

## Input requirements (v4)

[!INCLUDE [input requirements](../includes/input-requirements.md)]

## Get started with Read model (v4)

Try extracting text from forms and documents using the Document Intelligence Studio. You need the following assets:

* An Azure subscription—you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).

* A [Document Intelligence instance](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your key and endpoint.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of keys and endpoint location in the Azure portal.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Document Intelligence Studio doesn't support Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and HTML file formats.

## Supported languages and locales (v4)

See our [Language Support—document analysis models](../language-support/ocr.md) page for a complete list of supported languages.

## Data extraction (v4)

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Word and HTML file are supported in v4.0. Compared with PDF and images, below features are not supported:
>
> * There are no angle, width/height and unit with each page object.
> * For each object detected, there is no bounding polygon or bounding region.
> * Page range (`pages`) is not supported as a parameter.
> * No `lines` object.

## Searchable PDFs

The searchable PDF capability enables you to convert an analog PDF, such as scanned-image PDF files, to a PDF with embedded text. The embedded text enables deep text search within the PDF's extracted content by overlaying the detected text entities on top of the image files.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > * Currently, the searchable PDF capability is only supported by Read OCR model `prebuilt-read`. When using this feature, please specify the `modelId` as `prebuilt-read`, as other model types will return error for this preview version.
  > * Searchable PDF is included with the 2024-07-31-preview `prebuilt-read` model with no additional cost for generating a searchable PDF output.

### Use searchable PDFs

To use searchable PDF, make a `POST` request using the `Analyze` operation and specify the output format as `pdf`:

```bash

     POST /documentModels/prebuilt-read:analyze?output=pdf
     {...}
     202
```

Poll for completion of the `Analyze` operation. Once the operation is complete, issue a `GET` request to retrieve the PDF format of the `Analyze` operation results.

Upon successful completion, the PDF can be retrieved and downloaded as `application/pdf`. This operation allows direct downloading of the embedded text form of PDF instead of Base64-encoded JSON.

```bash

     // Monitor the operation until completion.
     GET /documentModels/prebuilt-read/analyzeResults/{resultId}
     200
     {...}

     // Upon successful completion, retrieve the PDF as application/pdf.
     GET /documentModels/prebuilt-read/analyzeResults/{resultId}/pdf
     200 OK
     Content-Type: application/pdf
```

### Pages parameter

The pages collection is a list of pages within the document. Each page is represented sequentially within the document and includes the orientation angle indicating if the page is rotated and the width and height (dimensions in pixels). The page units in the model output are computed as shown:

|**File format**   | **Computed page unit**   | **Total pages**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Images (JPEG/JPG, PNG, BMP, HEIF) | Each image = 1 page unit | Total images  |
|PDF | Each page in the PDF = 1 page unit | Total pages in the PDF |
|TIFF | Each image in the TIFF = 1 page unit | Total images in the TIFF |
|Word (DOCX)  | Up to 3,000 characters = 1 page unit, embedded or linked images not supported | Total pages of up to 3,000 characters each |
|Excel (XLSX)  | Each worksheet = 1 page unit, embedded or linked images not supported | Total worksheets |
|PowerPoint (PPTX) |  Each slide = 1 page unit, embedded or linked images not supported | Total slides |
|HTML | Up to 3,000 characters = 1 page unit, embedded or linked images not supported | Total pages of up to 3,000 characters each |

#### [Sample code](#tab/sample-code)

```Python
    # Analyze pages.
    for page in result.pages:
        print(f"----Analyzing document from page #{page.page_number}----")
        print(f"Page has width: {page.width} and height: {page.height}, measured with unit: {page.unit}")
```

    "pages": [
        {
            "pageNumber": 1,
            "angle": 0,
            "width": 915,

            "words": [],
            "lines": [],
            "spans": []
        }
    ]
```

---

### Use pages for text extraction

For large multi-page PDF documents, use the `pages` query parameter to indicate specific page numbers or page ranges for text extraction.

### Paragraph extraction

The Read OCR model in Document Intelligence extracts all identified blocks of text in the `paragraphs` collection as a top level object under `analyzeResults`. Each entry in this collection represents a text block and includes the extracted text as`content` and the bounding `polygon` coordinates. The `span` information points to the text fragment within the top-level `content` property that contains the full text from the document.

```json
    "paragraphs": [
        {
            "spans": [],
            "boundingRegions": [],
            "content": "While healthcare is still in the early stages of its Al journey, we are seeing pharmaceutical and other life sciences organizations making major investments in Al and related technologies.\" TOM LAWRY | National Director for Al, Health and Life Sciences | Microsoft"
        }
    ]
```

### Text, lines, and words extraction

The Read OCR model extracts print and handwritten style text as `lines` and `words`. The model outputs bounding `polygon` coordinates and `confidence` for the extracted words. The `styles` collection includes any handwritten style for lines if detected along with the spans pointing to the associated text. This feature applies to [supported handwritten languages](../../language-support.md).

For Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and HTML, Document Intelligence Read model v3.1 and later versions extracts all embedded text as is. Texts are extrated as words and paragraphs. Embedded images aren't supported.

#### [Sample code](#tab/sample-code)

```Python
    # Analyze lines.
    if page.lines:
        for line_idx, line in enumerate(page.lines):
            words = get_words(page, line)
            print(
                f"...Line # {line_idx} has {len(words)} words and text '{line.content}' within bounding polygon '{line.polygon}'"
            )

            # Analyze words.
            for word in words:
                print(f"......Word '{word.content}' has a confidence of {word.confidence}")
```

  > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
  > [View samples on GitHub.](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/document-intelligence-code-samples/blob/main/Python(v4.0)/Read_model/sample_analyze_read.py)

#### [Output](#tab/output)

```json
    "words": [
        {
            "content": "While",
            "polygon": [],
            "confidence": 0.997,
            "span": {}
        },
    ],
    "lines": [
        {
            "content": "While healthcare is still in the early stages of its Al journey, we",
            "polygon": [],
            "spans": [],
        }
    ]
```

---

### Handwritten style extraction

The response includes classifying whether each text line is of handwriting style or not, along with a confidence score. For more information, *see* [handwritten language support](../language-support/ocr.md). The following example shows an example JSON snippet.

```json
    "styles": [
    {
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "spans": [
        {
            "offset": 509,
            "length": 24
        }
        "isHandwritten": true
        ]
    }
```

If you enabled the [font/style addon capability](../concept-add-on-capabilities.md#font-property-extraction), you also get the font/style result as part of the `styles` object.

### Use searchable PDF

To use searchable PDF, make a `POST` request using the `Analyze` operation and specify the output format as `pdf`:

```bash

    POST /documentModels/prebuilt-read:analyze?output=pdf
    {...}
    202
```

Poll for completion of the `Analyze` operation. Once the operation is complete, issue a `GET` request to retrieve the PDF format of the `Analyze` operation results.

Upon successful completion, the PDF can be retrieved and downloaded as `application/pdf`. This operation allows direct downloading of the embedded text form of PDF instead of Base64-encoded JSON.

```bash

    // Monitor the operation until completion.
    GET /documentModels/prebuilt-read/analyzeResults/{resultId}
    200
    {...}

    // Upon successful completion, retrieve the PDF as application/pdf.
    GET /documentModels/prebuilt-read/analyzeResults/{resultId}/pdf
    200 OK
    Content-Type: application/pdf
```

### Pages

The pages collection is a list of pages within the document. Each page is represented sequentially within the document and includes the orientation angle indicating if the page is rotated and the width and height (dimensions in pixels). The page units in the model output are computed as shown:

|**File format**   | **Computed page unit**   | **Total pages**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Images (JPEG/JPG, PNG, BMP, HEIF) | Each image = 1 page unit | Total images  |
|PDF | Each page in the PDF = 1 page unit | Total pages in the PDF |
|TIFF | Each image in the TIFF = 1 page unit | Total images in the TIFF |
|Word (DOCX)  | Up to 3,000 characters = 1 page unit, embedded or linked images not supported | Total pages of up to 3,000 characters each |
|Excel (XLSX)  | Each worksheet = 1 page unit, embedded or linked images not supported | Total worksheets |
|PowerPoint (PPTX) |  Each slide = 1 page unit, embedded or linked images not supported | Total slides |
|HTML | Up to 3,000 characters = 1 page unit, embedded or linked images not supported | Total pages of up to 3,000 characters each |

### Select pages for text extraction

For large multi-page PDF documents, use the `pages` query parameter to indicate specific page numbers or page ranges for text extraction.

### Paragraphs

The Read OCR model in Document Intelligence extracts all identified blocks of text in the `paragraphs` collection as a top level object under `analyzeResults`. Each entry in this collection represents a text block and includes the extracted text as`content` and the bounding `polygon` coordinates. The `span` information points to the text fragment within the top-level `content` property that contains the full text from the document.

```json
    "paragraphs": [
        {
            "spans": [],
            "boundingRegions": [],
            "content": "While healthcare is still in the early stages of its Al journey, we are seeing pharmaceutical and other life sciences organizations making major investments in Al and related technologies.\" TOM LAWRY | National Director for Al, Health and Life Sciences | Microsoft"
        }

### Text, lines, and words

The Read OCR model extracts print and handwritten style text as `lines` and `words`. The model outputs bounding `polygon` coordinates and `confidence` for the extracted words. The `styles` collection includes any handwritten style for lines if detected along with the spans pointing to the associated text. This feature applies to [supported handwritten languages](../language-support/prebuilt.md).

For Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and HTML, Document Intelligence Read model v3.1 and later versions extracts all embedded text as is. Texts are extrated as words and paragraphs. Embedded images aren't supported.

```Python
    # Analyze lines.
    for line_idx, line in enumerate(page.lines):
        words = line.get_words()
        print(
            f"...Line # {line_idx} has {len(words)} words and text '{line.content}' within bounding polygon '{format_polygon(line.polygon)}'"
        )

        # Analyze words.
        for word in words:
            print(
                f"......Word '{word.content}' has a confidence of {word.confidence}"
            )

### Handwritten style for text lines

The response includes classifying whether each text line is of handwriting style or not, along with a confidence score. For more information, *see* [handwritten language support](../language-support/ocr.md). The following example shows an example JSON snippet.

```json
    "styles": [
    {
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "spans": [
        {
            "offset": 509,
            "length": 24
        }
        "isHandwritten": true
        ]
    }
```

If you enabled the [font/style addon capability](../concept-add-on-capabilities.md#font-property-extraction), you also get the font/style result as part of the `styles` object.
