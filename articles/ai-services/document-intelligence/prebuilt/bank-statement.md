# Document Intelligence bank statement model

The Document Intelligence bank statement model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extract data from US bank statements. The API analyzes printed bank statements; extracts key information such as account number, bank details, statement details, transaction details, and fees;  and returns a structured JSON data representation.

## Bank statement data extraction

A bank statement helps review account's activities during a specified period. It's an official statement that helps in detecting fraud, tracking expenses, accounting errors and record the period's activities. See how data is extracted using the `prebuilt-bankStatement.us` model. You need the following resources:

* An Azure subscriptionâ€”you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Document Intelligence instance](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your key and endpoint.
