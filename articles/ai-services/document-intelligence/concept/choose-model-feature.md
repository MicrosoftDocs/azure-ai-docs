Azure AI Document Intelligence supports a wide variety of models that enable you to add intelligent document processing to your applications and optimize your workflows. Selecting the right model is essential to ensure the success of your enterprise. In this article, we explore the available Document Intelligence models and provide guidance for how to choose the best solution for your projects.

The following decision charts highlight the features of each supported model to help you choose the model that best meets the needs and requirements of your application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to check the [**language support**](../language-support/prebuilt.md) page for supported language text and field extraction  by feature.

## Pretrained document-analysis models

| Document type | Example| Data to extract | Your best solution |
| -----------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
|**A generic document**. | A contract or letter. |You want to primarily extract written or printed text lines, words, locations, and detected languages.|[**Read OCR model**](../prebuilt/read.md)|
|**A document that includes structural information**. |A report or study.| In addition to written or printed text, you need to extract structural information like tables, selection marks, paragraphs, titles, headings, and subheadings.| [**Layout analysis model**](../prebuilt/layout.md)|
|**A structured or semi-structured document that includes content formatted as fields (keys) and values**.|A form or document that is a standardized format commonly used in your business or industry like a credit application or survey. | You want to extract fields and values including ones not covered by the scenario-specific prebuilt models **without having to train a custom model**.| [**Layout analysis model with the optional query string parameter `features=keyValuePairs` enabled **](../prebuilt/layout.md)|

>[!Tip]
>
> * If you're still unsure which pretrained model to use, try the **layout model** with the optional query string parameter **`features=keyValuePairs`** enabled.
> * The layout model is powered by the Read OCR engine to detect pages, tables, styles, text, lines, words, locations, and languages.
