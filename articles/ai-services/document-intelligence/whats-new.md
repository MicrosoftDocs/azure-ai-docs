* Depending on the document extraction scenario, configure the analysis range, document page range, optional detection, and premium detection features.

    :::image type="content" source="media/studio/analyze-options.gif" alt-text="Animated screenshot showing use of the analyze-options button to configure options in Studio.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Font extraction is not visualized in Document Intelligence Studio. However, you can check the styles section of the JSON output for the font detection results.

✔️ **Auto labeling documents with prebuilt models or one of your own models**

* In custom extraction model labeling page, you can now auto label your documents using one of Document Intelligent Service prebuilt models or models you previously trained.

    :::image type="content" source="media/studio/auto-label.gif" alt-text="Animated screenshot showing auto labeling in Studio.":::

* For some documents, there can be duplicate labels after running auto label. Make sure to modify the labels so that there are no duplicate labels in the labeling page afterwards.

    :::image type="content" source="media/studio/duplicate-labels.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing duplicate label warning after auto labeling.":::

✔️ **Auto labeling tables**

* In custom extraction model labeling page, you can now auto label the tables in the document without having to label the tables manually.

    :::image type="content" source="media/studio/auto-table-label.gif" alt-text="Animated screenshot showing auto table labeling in Studio.":::

✔️ **Add test files directly to your training dataset**

* Once you train a custom extraction model, make use of the test page to improve your model quality by uploading test documents to training dataset if needed.

* If a low confidence score is returned for some labels, make sure your labels are correct. If not, add them to the training dataset and relabel to improve the model quality.

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/add-from-test.gif" alt-text="Animated screenshot showing how to add test files to training dataset.":::

✔️ **Make use of the document list options and filters in custom projects**

* Use the custom extraction model labeling page. You can now navigate through your training documents with ease by making use of the search, filter, and sort by feature.

* Utilize the grid view to preview documents or use the list view to scroll through the documents more easily.

    :::image type="content" source="media/studio/document-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing document list view options and filters.":::

✔️ **Project sharing**

* [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio) June release is the latest update to the Document Intelligence Studio. There are considerable user experience and accessibility improvements addressed in this update:

  * **Code sample for JavaScript and C#**. The Studio code tab now adds JavaScript and C# code samples in addition to the existing Python one.
  * **New document upload UI**. Studio now supports uploading a document with drag & drop into the new upload user interface.
  * **New feature for custom projects**. Custom projects now support creating storage account and blobs when configuring the project. In addition, custom project now supports uploading training files directly within the Studio and copying the existing custom model.

* Document Intelligence v3.0 **2022-06-30-preview** release presents extensive updates across the feature APIs:

  * [**Layout extends structure extraction**](prebuilt/layout.md). Layout now includes added structure elements including sections, section headers, and paragraphs. This update enables finer grain document segmentation scenarios. For a complete list of structure elements identified, _see_ [enhanced structure](prebuilt/layout.md#data-extraction).
  * [**Custom neural model tabular fields support**](train/custom-neural.md). Custom document models now support tabular fields. Tabular fields by default are also multi page. To learn more about tabular fields in custom neural models, _see_ [tabular fields](train/custom-neural.md#tabular-fields).
  * [**Custom template model tabular fields support for cross page tables**](train/custom-template.md). Custom form models now support tabular fields across pages. To learn more about tabular fields in custom template models, _see_ [tabular fields](train/custom-neural.md#tabular-fields).
  * [**Invoice model output now includes general document key-value pairs**](prebuilt/invoice.md). Where invoices contain required fields beyond the fields included in the prebuilt model, the general document model supplements the output with key-value pairs. _See_ [key value pairs](prebuilt/invoice.md#key-value-pairs).
  * [**Invoice language expansion**](prebuilt/invoice.md). The invoice model includes expanded language support. _See_ [supported languages](prebuilt/invoice.md#supported-languages-and-locales).
  * [**Prebuilt business card**](concept-business-card.md) now includes Japanese language support. _See_ [supported languages](concept-business-card.md#supported-languages-and-locales).
  * [**Prebuilt ID document model**](prebuilt/id-document.md). The ID document model now extracts DateOfIssue, Height, Weight, EyeColor, HairColor, and DocumentDiscriminator from US driver's licenses. _See_ [field extraction](prebuilt/id-document.md).
  * [**Read model now supports common Microsoft Office document types**](prebuilt/read.md). Document types like Word (docx), Excel (xlsx), and PowerPoint (pptx) are now supported with the Read API. See [Read data extraction](prebuilt/read.md#data-extraction).
