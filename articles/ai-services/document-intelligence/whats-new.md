# What's new in Azure AI Document Intelligence

[!INCLUDE [applies to v4.0, v3.1, v3.0, and v2.1](includes/applies-to-v40-v31-v30-v21.md)]

Document Intelligence service is updated on an ongoing basis. Bookmark this page to stay up to date with release notes, feature enhancements, and our newest documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preview API versions are retired once the GA API is released. The 2023-02-28-preview API version is retiring. If you're still using the preview API or the associated SDK versions, update your code to target the latest API version `2024-11-30 (GA)`. </br>

## April 2025
**Document Intelligence v4.0 container is now available! Currently, Layout model is the only supported model for v4.0 release.**
<br>
For more information, *see:*
* [Install and run containers](containers/install-run.md?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&preserve-view=true)
* [Container image tags](containers/image-tags.md?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&preserve-view=true)

## December 2024

**Document Intelligence v4.0 programming language SDKs are now generally available (GA)**! <br><br>The latest client libraries default to the [**2024-11-30 REST API (GA)**](/rest/api/aiservices/operation-groups?view=rest-aiservices-v4.0%20(2024-11-30)&preserve-view=true) version of the service.<br><br>

## November 2024

**Document Intelligence REST API v4.0: [**2024-11-30 REST API (GA)**](/rest/api/aiservices/operation-groups?view=rest-aiservices-v4.0%20(2024-11-30)&preserve-view=true) is now generally available (GA)**! The v4.0 REST API includes the following changes:

* [ðŸ†• Batch API](concept-batch-analysis.md)
  * Batch API now supports all models, including all read, layout, prebuilt verticals, and custom models.
  * Batch API supports LIST function to allow users to list batch jobs within past seven days.
