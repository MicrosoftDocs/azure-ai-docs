 Azure AI Document Intelligence supports various models that you can use to add intelligent document processing to your apps and flows. You can use a prebuilt domain-specific model or train a custom model tailored to your specific business needs and use cases. You can use Document Intelligence with the REST API or Python, C#, Java, and JavaScript client libraries.

> Document processing projects that involve financial data, protected health data, personal data, or highly sensitive data require careful attention. Be sure to comply with all [national/regional and industry-specific requirements](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/microsoft-azure-compliance-offerings/).

\** All the capabilities for the general document model are available in the layout model. The general model is no longer supported.

### Latency

Latency is the amount of time it takes for an API server to handle and process an incoming request and deliver the outgoing response to the client. The time to analyze a document depends on the size (for example, number of pages) and associated content on each page. Document Intelligence is a multitenant asynchronous service where latency for similar documents is comparable but not always identical. Occasional variability in latency and performance is inherent in any microservice-based, stateless service that processes images and large documents at scale. Although we're continuously scaling up the hardware and capacity and scaling capabilities, you might still have latency issues at runtime.

### Add-on capability

The following add-on capabilities are available for Document Intelligence. For all models except the business card model, Document Intelligence now supports add-on capabilities to allow for more sophisticated analysis. You can enable and disable these optional capabilities depending on the scenario of the document extraction. The following add-on capabilities are available for the 2023-07-31 (GA) and later API version:

* [`ocrHighResolution`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#high-resolution-extraction)
* [`formulas`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#formula-extraction)
* [`styleFont`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#font-property-extraction)
* [`barcodes`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#barcode-property-extraction)
* [`languages`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#language-detection)
* [`keyValuePairs`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#`value-pairs)
* [`queryFields`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#query-fields) (not available with the US tax models)
* [`searchablePDF`](prebuilt/read.md#searchable-pdf) (available only for the read model)

Query fields are priced differently from the other add-on features. For more information, see [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-document-intelligence/).

::: moniker range=">=doc-intel-3.0.0"

### Bounding box and polygon coordinates

A bounding box (`polygon` in v3.0 and later versions) is an abstract rectangle that surrounds text elements in a document. A bounding box is used as a reference point for object detection:

* The bounding box specifies position by using an x and y coordinate plane presented in an array of four numerical pairs. Each pair represents a corner of the box in the following order: upper left, upper right, lower right, lower left.
* Image coordinates are presented in pixels. For a PDF, coordinates are presented in inches.

## Language support

The universal models in Document Intelligence that are based on deep learning support many languages. The models can extract multilingual text from your images and documents, including text lines with mixed languages. Language support varies by Document Intelligence service functionality. For a complete list, see the following articles:

* [Language support: Document analysis models](language-support/ocr.md)
* [Language support: Prebuilt models](language-support/prebuilt.md)
* [Language support: Custom models](language-support/custom.md)

## Regional availability

Document Intelligence is generally available in many of the [60+ Azure global infrastructure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=metrics-advisor&regions=all#select-product).

To help choose the region that's best for you and your customers, see [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/#overview).

> [Learn more: Identity document model](concept-credit-card.md)

### Custom models

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom.png":::

Custom models are broadly classified into two types. Custom classification models that support classification of a "document type" and custom extraction models that can extract a defined schema from a specific document type.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-models.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows types of custom models and associated model build modes.":::

Custom document models analyze and extract data from forms and documents specific to your business. They recognize form fields within your distinct content and extract key/value pairs and table data. You need only one example of the form type to get started.

Version v3.0 and later custom models support signature detection in custom template (form) and cross-page tables in both template and neural models. [Signature detection](train/custom-template.md#model-capabilities) looks for the presence of a signature, not the identity of the person who signs the document. If the model returns **unsigned** for signature detection, the model didn't find a signature in the defined field.

This sample custom template was processed by using [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/customform/projects).

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/train-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Document Intelligence analyzing a custom form.":::

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more: Custom model](train/custom-model.md)

#### Custom extraction

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom-extraction.png":::

The custom extraction model comes in two types: custom template and custom neural. To create a custom extraction model, label a dataset of documents with the values you want extracted and train the model on the labeled dataset. You need only five examples of the same form or document type to get started.

This sample custom extraction was processed by using [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/customform/projects).

> [Learn more: Custom template model](train/custom-template.md)

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more: Custom neural model](./train/custom-neural.md)

#### Custom classifier

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom-classifier.png":::

With the custom classification model, you can identify the document type before you invoke the extraction model. The classification model is available starting with the 2023-07-31 (GA) API. Training a custom classification model requires at least two distinct classes and a minimum of five samples per class.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more: Custom classification model](train/custom-classifier.md)

#### Composed models

A composed model is created by taking a collection of custom models and assigning them to a single model built from your form types. You can assign multiple custom models to a composed model that are called with a single model ID. You can assign up to 200 trained custom models to a single composed model.

This sample composed model is in [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/customform/projects).

### Custom

Custom models analyze and extract data from forms and documents specific to your business. The API is a machine-learning program trained to recognize form fields within your distinct content and extract key/value pairs and table data. You need only five examples of the same form type to get started. You can train your custom model with or without labeled datasets.

This sample custom model was processed by using the [Sample Labeling tool](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/).

#### Composed custom model

A composed model is created by taking a collection of custom models and assigning them to a single model built from your form types. You can assign multiple custom models to a composed model that are called with a single model ID. You can assign up to 100 trained custom models to a single composed model.
