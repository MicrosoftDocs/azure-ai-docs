 Azure AI Document Intelligence supports a wide variety of models that enable you to add intelligent document processing to your apps and flows. You can use a prebuilt domain-specific model or train a custom model tailored to your specific business need and use cases. Document Intelligence can be used with the REST API or Python, C#, Java, and JavaScript client libraries.

### Latency

Latency is the amount of time it takes for an API server to handle and process an incoming request and deliver the outgoing response to the client. The time to analyze a document depends on the size (for example, number of pages) and associated content on each page. Document Intelligence is a multitenant service where latency for similar documents is comparable but not always identical. Occasional variability in latency and performance is inherent in any microservice-based, stateless, asynchronous service that processes images and large documents at scale. Although we're continuously scaling up the hardware and capacity and scaling capabilities, you might still have latency issues at runtime.

### Model analysis features

[!INCLUDE [model analysis features](includes/model-analysis-features.md)]

Add-On* - Query fields are priced differently than the other add-on features. See [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-document-intelligence/) for details.

::: moniker range=">=doc-intel-3.0.0"

### Bounding box and polygon coordinates

A bounding box (`polygon` in v3.0 and later versions) is an abstract rectangle that surrounds text elements in a document used as a reference point for object detection.

* The bounding box specifies position by using an x and y coordinate plane presented in an array of four numerical pairs. Each pair represents a corner of the box in the following order: upper left, upper right, lower right, lower left.

* Image coordinates are presented in pixels. For a PDF, coordinates are presented in inches.

For all models, except Business card model, Document Intelligence now supports add-on capabilities to allow for more sophisticated analysis. These optional capabilities can be enabled and disabled depending on the scenario of the document extraction. There are seven add-on capabilities available for the `2023-07-31` (GA) and later API version:

* [`ocrHighResolution`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#high-resolution-extraction)
* [`formulas`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#formula-extraction)
* [`styleFont`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#font-property-extraction)
* [`barcodes`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#barcode-property-extraction)
* [`languages`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#language-detection)
* [`keyValuePairs`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#key-value-pairs) (2024-02-29-preview, 2023-10-31-preview)
* [`queryFields`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#query-fields) (2024-02-29-preview, 2023-10-31-preview) `Not available with the US.Tax models`
* [`searchablePDF`](prebuilt/read.md#searchable-pdf) (2024-07-31-preview) `Only available for Read Model`

## Language support

The deep-learning-based universal models in Document Intelligence support many languages that can extract multilingual text from your images and documents, including text lines with mixed languages.
Language support varies by Document Intelligence service functionality. For a complete list, see the following articles:

* [Language support: document analysis models](language-support/ocr.md)
* [Language support: prebuilt models](language-support/prebuilt.md)
* [Language support: custom models](language-support/custom.md)

### Custom models

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom.png":::

Custom models can be broadly classified into two types. Custom classification models that support classification of a "document type" and custom extraction models that can extract a defined schema from a specific document type.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-models.png" alt-text="Diagram of types of custom models and associated model build modes.":::

Custom document models analyze and extract data from forms and documents specific to your business. They recognize form fields within your distinct content and extract key-value pairs and table data. You only need one example of the form type to get started.

Version v3.0 and later custom models support signature detection in custom template (form) and cross-page tables in both template and neural models. [Signature detection](train/custom-template.md#model-capabilities) looks for the presence of a signature, not the identity of the person who signs the document. If the model returns **unsigned** for signature detection, the model didn't find a signature in the defined field.

***Sample custom template processed using [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/customform/projects)***:

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/train-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Document Intelligence tool analyze-a-custom-form window.":::

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more: custom model](train/custom-model.md)

#### Custom extraction

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom-extraction.png":::

Custom extraction model can be one of two types, **custom template** or **custom neural**. To create a custom extraction model, label a dataset of documents with the values you want extracted and train the model on the labeled dataset. You only need five examples of the same form or document type to get started.

***Sample custom extraction processed using [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/customform/projects)***:

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/custom-extraction-models.png" alt-text="Screenshot of custom extraction model analysis in Document Intelligence Studio.":::

> [Learn more: custom template model](train/custom-template.md)

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more: custom neural model](./train/custom-neural.md)

#### Custom classifier

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom-classifier.png":::

The custom classification model enables you to identify the document type before invoking the extraction model. The classification model is available starting with the `2023-07-31 (GA)` API. Training a custom classification model requires at least two distinct classes and a minimum of five samples per class.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more: custom classification model](train/custom-classifier.md)

#### Composed models

A composed model is created by taking a collection of custom models and assigning them to a single model built from your form types. You can assign multiple custom models to a composed model called with a single model ID. You can assign up to 200 trained custom models to a single composed model.

#### Composed custom model

A composed model is created by taking a collection of custom models and assigning them to a single model built from your form types. You can assign multiple custom models to a composed model called with a single model ID. You can assign up to 100 trained custom models to a single composed model.
