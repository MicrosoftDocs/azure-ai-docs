Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based platform that can be used to automate workflows without writing a single line of code. The platform enables you to easily integrate Microsoft and your applications with your apps, data, services, and systems. A Logic App is the Azure resource you create when you want to develop a workflow. Here are a few examples of what you can do with a Logic App:

* Create business processes and workflows visually.
* Integrate workflows with software as a service (SaaS) and enterprise applications.
* Automate enterprise application integration (EAI), business-to-business (B2B), and electronic data interchange (EDI) tasks.

For more information, *see* [Logic Apps Overview](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview).

 In this tutorial, we show you how to build a Logic App connector flow to automate the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Detect when an invoice as been added to a OneDrive folder.
> * Process the invoice using the Document Intelligence prebuilt-invoice model.
> * Send the extracted information from the invoice to a pre-specified email address.

Choose a workflow using a file from either your Microsoft OneDrive account or Microsoft ShareDrive site:

:::zone pivot="workflow-onedrive"
[!INCLUDE [OneDrive](../includes/logic-app-tutorial/onedrive.md)]
:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="workflow-sharepoint"
[!INCLUDE [SharePoint](../includes/logic-app-tutorial/sharepoint.md)]
:::zone-end

## Test the automation flow

Let's quickly review what we completed before we test our flow:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * We created a trigger—in this scenario. The trigger is activated when a file is created in a pre-specified folder in our OneDrive account.
> * We added a Document Intelligence action to our flow. In this scenario, we decided to use the invoice API to automatically analyze an invoice from the OneDrive folder.
> * We added an Outlook.com action to our flow. We sent some of the analyzed invoice data to a pre-determined email address.

Now that we created the flow, the last thing to do is to test it and make sure that we're getting the expected behavior.

1. To test the Logic App, first open a new tab and navigate to the OneDrive folder you set up at the beginning of this tutorial. Add this file to the OneDrive folder [Sample invoice.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/invoice-logic-apps-tutorial.pdf)

1. Return to the Logic App designer tab and select the **Run trigger** button and select **Run** from the drop-down menu.

1. You see a message in the upper=right corner indicating that the trigger was successful:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-apps-tutorial/trigger-successful.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Successful trigger message.":::

1. Navigate to your Logic App overview page by selecting your app name link in the upper-left corner.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-apps-tutorial/navigate-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of navigate to overview page link.":::

1. Check the status, to see if the run succeeded or failed. You can select the status indicator to check which steps were successful.

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="../media/logic-apps-tutorial/succeeded-failed-indicator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Succeeded or Failed status.":::

1. If your run failed, check the failed step to ensure that you entered the correct information.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-apps-tutorial/failed-run-step.png" alt-text="Screenshot of failed step.":::

1. After a workflow run succeeds, check your email. There's a new email with the information we specified.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-apps-tutorial/invoice-received.png" alt-text="Screenshot of received email message.":::

1. After you're done, [disable or delete your logic app](/azure/logic-apps/manage-logic-apps-with-azure-portal?tabs=consumption#disable-enable-logic-apps) so that usage stops.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-apps-tutorial/disable-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of disable and delete buttons.":::

Congratulations! You completed this tutorial.
