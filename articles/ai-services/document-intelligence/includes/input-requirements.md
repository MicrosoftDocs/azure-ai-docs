* **Photos and scans**: For best results, provide one clear photo or high-quality scan per document.
* **PDFs and TIFFs**: For PDFs and TIFFs, up to 2,000 pages can be processed. (With a free-tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed.)
* **File size**: The file size for analyzing documents is 500 MB for the paid (S0) tier and 4 MB for the free (F0) tier.
* **Image dimensions**: The dimensions must be between 50 pixels x 50 pixels and 10,000 pixels x 10,000 pixels.
