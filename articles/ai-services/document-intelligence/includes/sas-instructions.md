To retrieve the SAS URL for your custom model training data, go to your storage resource in the Azure portal and select the **Storage Explorer** tab. Navigate to your container, right-click, and select **Get shared access signature**. It's important to get the SAS for your container, not for the storage account itself. Make sure the **Read**, **Write**, **Delete** and **List** permissions are checked, and click **Create**. Then copy the value in the **URL** section to a temporary location. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.
