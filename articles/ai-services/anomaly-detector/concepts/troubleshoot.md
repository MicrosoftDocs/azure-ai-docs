| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|`InvalidRequestParameterError`| 400             | Invalid values for $skip or $top. | Check whether the values for the two parameters are numerical. The values $skip and $top are used to list the models with pagination. Because the API only returns the 10 most recently updated models, you could use $skip and $top to get models updated earlier. |

### Anomaly detection with a trained model

| Error code        | HTTP error code | Error message                                                | Comment                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `ModelFailed`     | 400             | Model failed to be trained.                                  | The model isn't successfully trained. Get detailed information by getting the model with model ID. |
| `ModelNotReady`   | 400             | The model is not ready yet.                                  | The model isn't ready yet. Wait for a while until the training process completes. |
| `InvalidFileSize` | 413             | File \<file> exceeds the file size limit (\<size limit> bytes). | The size of inference data exceeds the upper limit, which is currently 2 GB. Use less data for inference. |

### Get detection results

| Error code       | HTTP error code | Error message              | Comment                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ResultNotExist` | 404             | The result does not exist. | The result per request doesn't exist. Either inference hasn't completed or the result has expired. The expiration time is seven days. |

### Data processing errors

The following error codes don't have associated HTTP error codes.

| Error code             | Error message                                                | Comment                                                      |
| ---------------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NoVariablesFound`     | No variables found. Check that your files are organized as per instruction. | No CSV files could be found from the data source. This error is typically caused by incorrect organization of files. See the sample data for the desired structure. |
| `DuplicatedVariables`  | There are multiple variables with the same name.             | There are duplicated variable names.                         |
| `FileNotExist`         | File \<filename> does not exist.                              | This error usually happens during inference. The variable has appeared in the training data but is missing in the inference data. |
| `RedundantFile`        | File \<filename> is redundant.                                | This error usually happens during inference. The variable wasn't in the training data but appeared in the inference data. |
| `FileSizeTooLarge`     | The size of file \<filename> is too large.                    | The size of the single CSV file \<filename> exceeds the limit. Train with less data. |
| `ReadingFileError`     | Errors occurred when reading \<filename>. \<error messages>    | Failed to read the file \<filename>. For more information, see the \<error messages> or verify with `pd.read_csv(filename)` in a local environment. |
| `FileColumnsNotExist`  | Columns timestamp or value in file \<filename> do not exist.  | Each CSV file must have two columns with the names **timestamp** and **value** (case sensitive). |
| `VariableParseError`   | Variable \<variable> parse \<error message> error.             | Can't process the \<variable> because of runtime errors. For more information, see the \<error message> or contact us with the \<error message>. |
| `MergeDataFailed`      | Failed to merge data. Check data format.              | Data merge failed. This error is possibly because of the wrong data format or the incorrect organization of files. See the sample data for the current file structure. |
| `ColumnNotFound`       | Column \<column> cannot be found in the merged data.          | A column is missing after merge. Verify the data.     |
| `NumColumnsMismatch`   | Number of columns of merged data does not match the number of variables. | Verify the data.                                      |
| `TooManyData`          | Too many data points. Maximum number is 1000000 per variable.       | Reduce the size of input data.                        |
| `NoData`               | There is no effective data.                                   | There's no data to train/inference after processing. Check the start time and end time. |
| `DataExceedsLimit`.     | The length of data whose timestamp is between `startTime` and `endTime` exceeds limit(\<limit>). | The size of data after processing exceeds the limit. Currently, there's no limit on processed data. |
| `NotEnoughInput`       | Not enough data. The length of data is \<data length>, but the minimum length should be larger than sliding window, which is \<sliding window size>. | The minimum number of data points for inference is the size of the sliding window. Try to provide more data for inference. |
