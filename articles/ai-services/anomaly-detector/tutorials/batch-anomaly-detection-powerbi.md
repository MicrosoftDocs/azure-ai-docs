# Tutorial: Visualize anomalies using batch detection and Power BI (univariate)

[!INCLUDE [Deprecation announcement](../includes/deprecation.md)]

Use this tutorial to find anomalies within a time series data set as a batch. Using Power BI desktop, you will take an Excel file, prepare the data for the Anomaly Detector API, and visualize statistical anomalies throughout it.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use Power BI Desktop to import and transform a time series data set
> * Integrate Power BI Desktop with the Anomaly Detector API for batch anomaly detection
> * Visualize anomalies found within your data, including expected and seen values, and anomaly detection boundaries.

## Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/get-started/), available for free.
* An excel file (.xlsx) containing time series data points.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAnomalyDetector"  title="Create an Anomaly Detector resource"  target="_blank">create an Anomaly Detector resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Anomaly Detector API. You'll do this later in the quickstart.

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-anomaly-detector-data-requirements](../../includes/cognitive-services-anomaly-detector-data-requirements.md)]

## Load and format the time series data

To get started, open Power BI Desktop and load the time series data you downloaded from the prerequisites. This excel file contains a series of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) timestamp and value pairs.  

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI can use data from a wide variety of sources, such as .csv files, SQL databases, Azure blob storage, and more.  

In the main Power BI Desktop window, select the **Home** ribbon. In the **External data** group of the ribbon, open the **Get Data** drop-down menu and select **Excel**.

![An image of the "Get Data" button in Power BI](../media/tutorials/power-bi-get-data-button.png)

After the dialog appears, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the example .xlsx file and select it. After the **Navigator** dialogue appears, select **Sheet1**, and then **Edit**.

![An image of the data source "Navigator" screen in Power BI](../media/tutorials/navigator-dialog-box.png)

Power BI will convert the timestamps in the first column to a `Date/Time` data type. These timestamps must be converted to text in order to be sent to the Anomaly Detector API. If the Power Query editor doesn't automatically open, select **Edit Queries** on the home tab.

Select the **Transform** ribbon in the Power Query Editor. In the **Any Column** group, open the **Data Type:** drop-down menu, and select **Text**.

![An image of the data type drop down](../media/tutorials/data-type-drop-down.png)

When you get a notice about changing the column type, select **Replace Current**. Afterwards, select **Close & Apply** or **Apply** in the **Home** ribbon.

## Create a function to send the data and format the response

To format and send the data file to the Anomaly Detector API, you can invoke a query on the table created above. In the Power Query Editor, from the **Home** ribbon, open the **New Source** drop-down menu and select **Blank Query**.

Make sure your new query is selected, then select **Advanced Editor**.

![An image of the "Advanced Editor" screen](../media/tutorials/advanced-editor-screen.png)

Within the Advanced Editor, use the following Power Query M snippet to extract the columns from the table and send it to the API. Afterwards, the query will create a table from the JSON response, and return it. Replace the `apiKey` variable with your valid Anomaly Detector API key, and `endpoint` with your endpoint. After you've entered the query into the Advanced Editor, select **Done**.

```M
(table as table) => let

    apikey      = "[Placeholder: Your Anomaly Detector resource access key]",
    endpoint    = "[Placeholder: Your Anomaly Detector resource endpoint]/anomalydetector/v1.0/timeseries/entire/detect",
    inputTable = Table.TransformColumnTypes(table,{{"Timestamp", type text},{"Value", type number}}),
    jsontext    = Text.FromBinary(Json.FromValue(inputTable)),
    jsonbody    = "{ ""Granularity"": ""daily"", ""Sensitivity"": 95, ""Series"": "& jsontext &" }",
    bytesbody   = Text.ToBinary(jsonbody),
    headers     = [#"Content-Type" = "application/json", #"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" = apikey],
    bytesresp   = Web.Contents(endpoint, [Headers=headers, Content=bytesbody, ManualStatusHandling={400}]),
    jsonresp    = Json.Document(bytesresp),

    respTable = Table.FromColumns({

                     Table.Column(inputTable, "Timestamp")
                     ,Table.Column(inputTable, "Value")
                     , Record.Field(jsonresp, "IsAnomaly") as list
                     , Record.Field(jsonresp, "ExpectedValues") as list
                     , Record.Field(jsonresp, "UpperMargins")as list
                     , Record.Field(jsonresp, "LowerMargins") as list
                     , Record.Field(jsonresp, "IsPositiveAnomaly") as list
                     , Record.Field(jsonresp, "IsNegativeAnomaly") as list

                  }, {"Timestamp", "Value", "IsAnomaly", "ExpectedValues", "UpperMargin", "LowerMargin", "IsPositiveAnomaly", "IsNegativeAnomaly"}
               ),

    respTable1 = Table.AddColumn(respTable , "UpperMargins", (row) => row[ExpectedValues] + row[UpperMargin]),
    respTable2 = Table.AddColumn(respTable1 , "LowerMargins", (row) => row[ExpectedValues] -  row[LowerMargin]),
    respTable3 = Table.RemoveColumns(respTable2, "UpperMargin"),
    respTable4 = Table.RemoveColumns(respTable3, "LowerMargin"),

    results = Table.TransformColumnTypes(

                respTable4,
                {{"Timestamp", type datetime}, {"Value", type number}, {"IsAnomaly", type logical}, {"IsPositiveAnomaly", type logical}, {"IsNegativeAnomaly", type logical},
                 {"ExpectedValues", type number}, {"UpperMargins", type number}, {"LowerMargins", type number}}
              )

 in results
```

Invoke the query on your data sheet by selecting `Sheet1` below **Enter Parameter**, and select **Invoke**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). See the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article for more information.

## Data source privacy and authentication

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware of your organization's policies for data privacy and access. See [Power BI Desktop privacy levels](/power-bi/desktop-privacy-levels) for more information.

You may get a warning message when you attempt to run the query since it utilizes an external data source.

![An image showing a warning created by Power BI](../media/tutorials/blocked-function.png)

To fix this, select **File**, and **Options and settings**. Then select **Options**. Below **Current File**, select **Privacy**, and **Ignore the Privacy Levels and potentially improve performance**.

Additionally, you may get a message asking you to specify how you want to connect to the API.

![An image showing a request to specify access credentials](../media/tutorials/edit-credentials-message.png)

To fix this, select **Edit Credentials** in the message. After the dialogue box appears, select **Anonymous** to connect to the API anonymously. Then select **Connect**.

Afterwards, select **Close & Apply** in the **Home** ribbon to apply the changes.

## Visualize the Anomaly Detector API response

In the main Power BI screen, begin using the queries created above to visualize the data. First select **Line Chart** in **Visualizations**. Then add the timestamp from the invoked function to the line chart's **Axis**. Right-click on it, and select **Timestamp**.

![Right-clicking the Timestamp value](../media/tutorials/timestamp-right-click.png)

Add the following fields from the **Invoked Function** to the chart's **Values** field. Use the below screenshot to help build your chart.

* Value
* UpperMargins
* LowerMargins
* ExpectedValues

![An image of the chart settings](../media/tutorials/chart-settings.png)

After adding the fields, select on the chart and resize it to show all of the data points. Your chart will look similar to the below screenshot:

### Display anomaly data points

On the right side of the Power BI window, below the **FIELDS** pane, right-click on **Value** under the **Invoked Function query**, and select **New quick measure**.

![An image of the new quick measure screen](../media/tutorials/new-quick-measure.png)

On the screen that appears, select **Filtered value** as the calculation. Set **Base value** to `Sum of Value`. Then drag `IsAnomaly` from the **Invoked Function** fields to **Filter**. Select `True` from the **Filter** drop-down menu.

![A second image of the new quick measure screen](../media/tutorials/new-quick-measure-2.png)

After selecting **Ok**, you will have a `Value for True` field, at the bottom of the list of your fields. Right-click it and rename it to **Anomaly**. Add it to the chart's **Values**. Then select the **Format** tool, and set the X-axis type to **Categorical**.

![An image of the format x axis](../media/tutorials/format-x-axis.png)

Apply colors to your chart by selecting on the **Format** tool and **Data colors**. Your chart should look something like the following:
