# What is Video Retrieval?

[!INCLUDE [video-retrieval-deprecation](includes/video-retrieval-deprecation.md)]

Video Retrieval is a service that lets you create a search index, add documents (videos and images) to it, and search with natural language. Developers can define metadata schemas for each index and ingest metadata to the service to help with retrieval. Developers can also specify what features to extract from the index (vision, speech) and filter their search based on features.

## Responsible use of Spatial Analysis technology

To learn how to use Spatial Analysis technology responsibly, see the [Transparency note](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/computer-vision/transparency-note-spatial-analysis). Microsoft's transparency notes help you understand how our AI technology works and the choices system owners can make that influence system performance and behavior. They focus on the importance of thinking about the whole system including the technology, people, and environment.
