## Create environment variables 

In this example, write your credentials to environment variables on the local machine that runs the application.

[!INCLUDE [find key and endpoint](./find-key.md)]

To set the environment variable for your key and endpoint, open a console window and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment.

- To set the `VISION_KEY` environment variable, replace `<your_key>` with one of the keys for your resource.
- To set the `VISION_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `<your_endpoint>` with the endpoint for your resource.

[!INCLUDE [Azure key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-services/security/microsoft-entra-id-akv-expanded.md)]

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx VISION_KEY <your_key>
```

```console
setx VISION_ENDPOINT <your_endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will read the environment variables, including the console window.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export VISION_KEY=<your_key>
```

```bash
export VISION_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.
