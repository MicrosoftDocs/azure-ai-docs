> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is now retired. On March 31, 2025, the Azure AI Image Analysis 4.0 Segment API and background removal service were retired. API calls to these services will fail.
>
> The segmentation feature of the open-source [Florence 2 model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large) might meet your needs. It returns an alpha map marking the difference between foreground and background, but it doesn't edit the original image to remove the background. Install the Florence 2 model and try out its Region to segmentation feature.
>
> For full-featured background removal, consider a third-party utility like [BiRefNet](https://github.com/ZhengPeng7/BiRefNet).
