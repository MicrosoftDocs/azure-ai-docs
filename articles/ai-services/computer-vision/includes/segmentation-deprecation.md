> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is now deprecated. On January 10, 2025, the Azure AI Image Analysis 4.0 Segment API and background removal service will be retired. All requests to this service will fail after this date.
>
> To maintain a smooth operation of your models, install the open-source [Florence 2 model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large) and use its Region to segmentation feature, which allows for a similar background removal operation.
