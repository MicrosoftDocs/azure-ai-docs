* The minimum detectable face size is 36 x 36 pixels in an image that is no larger than 1920 x 1080 pixels. Images with larger than 1920 x 1080 pixels have a proportionally larger minimum face size. Reducing the face size might cause some faces not to be detected, even if they're larger than the minimum detectable face size.
* The maximum detectable face size is 4096 x 4096 pixels.
* Faces outside the size range of 36 x 36 to 4096 x 4096 pixels will not be detected.
