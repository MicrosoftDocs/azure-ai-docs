> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is now deprecated. On March 31, 2025, Azure AI Image Analysis 4.0 Custom Image Classification, Custom Object Detection, and Product Recognition preview API will be retired. After this date, API calls to these services will fail.
>
> To maintain a smooth operation of your models, transition to [Azure AI Custom Vision](/azure/ai-services/Custom-Vision-Service/overview), which is now generally available. Custom Vision offers similar functionality to these retiring features.
