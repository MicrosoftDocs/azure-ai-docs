## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).
- [An Azure AI Vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision). You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
- Connect to [Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/).
  - You might need to sign in.
  - After you sign in, select **View all resources**. If necessary, select **Refresh**. Verify that your resource is available.

  For more information, see [Get started using Vision Studio](../overview-vision-studio.md#get-started-using-vision-studio).

## Read printed and handwritten text

1. Under **Optical character recognition**, select **Extract text from images**.
1. Under **Try it out**, acknowledge that this demo incurs usage to your Azure account. For more information, see [Azure AI Vision pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/).
1. Select an image from the available set, or upload your own.
1. If necessary, select **Please select a resource** to select your resource.

   After you select your image, the extracted text appears in the output window. You can also select the **JSON** tab to see the JSON output that the API call returns.

Below the try-it-out experience are next steps to start using this capability in your own application.
