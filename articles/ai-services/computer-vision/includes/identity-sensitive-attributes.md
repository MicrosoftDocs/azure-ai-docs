> [!CAUTION]
> Microsoft has retired or limited facial recognition capabilities that can be used to try to infer emotional states and identity attributes which, if misused, can subject people to stereotyping, discrimination or unfair denial of services. The retired capabilities are emotion and gender. The limited capabilities are age, smile, facial hair, hair and makeup. Email [Azure Face team](mailto:azureface@microsoft.com) if you have a responsible use case that would benefit from the use of any of the limited capabilities.
