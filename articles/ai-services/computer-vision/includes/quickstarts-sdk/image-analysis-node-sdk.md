Use the Image Analysis client library for JavaScript to analyze a remote image for content tags.

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze a local image. See the [ComputerVisionClient](/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-computervision/computervisionclient) methods, such as `describeImageInStream`. Or, see the [sample code on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/javascript/ComputerVision/ImageAnalysisQuickstart.js) for scenarios involving local images.

> [!TIP]
> The Analyze Image API can do many different operations other than generate image tags. See the [Image Analysis how-to guide](../../how-to/call-analyze-image.md) for examples that showcase all of the available features.

[Reference documentation](/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-computervision/) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/cognitiveservices-computervision) | [Samples](/samples/browse/?products=azure&terms=computer-vision)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. You can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [Computer Vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision) in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, select **Go to resource**.
    * You need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Azure AI Vision service.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

[!INCLUDE [create environment variables](../environment-variables.md)]

## Analyze image

1. Create a new Node.js application

    In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

    ```console
    mkdir myapp && cd myapp
    ```

    Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a *package.json* file.

    ```console
    npm init
    ```

    ### Install the client library

    Install the `ms-rest-azure` and `@azure/cognitiveservices-computervision` npm package:

    ```console
    npm install @azure/cognitiveservices-computervision
    ```

    Also install the async module:

    ```console
    npm install async
    ```

    Your app's `package.json` file is updated with the dependencies.

    Create a new file, *index.js*.

1. Open *index.js* in a text editor and paste in the following code.

   [!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/ComputerVision/ImageAnalysisQuickstart-single.js?name=snippet_single)]


1. Run the application with the `node` command on your quickstart file.

   ```console
   node index.js
   ```

## Output

The output of the operation should look like the following example.

```console

DETECT TAGS

Analyzing tags in image... sample16.png
Tags: grass (1.00), dog (0.99), mammal (0.99), animal (0.99), dog breed (0.99), pet (0.97), outdoor (0.97), companion dog (0.91), small greek domestic dog (0.90), golden retriever (0.89), labrador retriever (0.87), puppy (0.87), ancient dog breeds (0.85), field (0.80), retriever (0.68), brown (0.66)

-------------------------------------------------
End of quickstart.
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)

## Next step

In this quickstart, you learned how to install the Image Analysis client library and make basic image analysis calls. Next, learn more about the Analyze Image API features.
