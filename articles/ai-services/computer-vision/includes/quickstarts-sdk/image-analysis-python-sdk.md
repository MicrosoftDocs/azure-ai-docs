Use the Image Analysis client library for Python to analyze a remote image for content tags.

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze a local image. See the [ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.operations.computervisionclientoperationsmixin) methods, such as `analyze_image_in_stream`. Or, see the [sample code on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/ComputerVision/ImageAnalysisQuickstart.py) for scenarios involving local images.

> [!TIP]
> The Analyze Image API can do many different operations other than generate image tags. See the [Image Analysis how-to guide](../../how-to/call-analyze-image.md) for examples that showcase all of the available features.

[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision) | [Package (PiPy)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/) | [Samples](/samples/browse/?products=azure&terms=computer-vision)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. You can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=ai-services).
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/).
  * Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [Computer Vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision) in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, select **Go to resource**.
    * You need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Azure AI Vision service.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

[!INCLUDE [create environment variables](../environment-variables.md)]

## Analyze image

1. Install the client library.

    You can install the client library with:

    ```console
    pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
    ```

    Also install the Pillow library.

    ```console
    pip install pillow
    ```

1. Create a new Python application.

    Create a new Python file. You can name it *quickstart-file.py*, for example.

1. Open *quickstart-file.py* in a text editor or IDE and paste in the following code.

   [!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ImageAnalysisQuickstart-single.py?name=snippet_single)]

1. Run the application by using the `python` command on your quickstart file.

   ```console
   python quickstart-file.py
   ```

## Output

The output of the operation should look like the following example.

```console
===== Tag an image - remote =====
Tags in the remote image:
'outdoor' with confidence 99.00%
'building' with confidence 98.81%
'sky' with confidence 98.21%
'stadium' with confidence 98.17%
'ancient rome' with confidence 96.16%
'ruins' with confidence 95.04%
'amphitheatre' with confidence 93.99%
'ancient roman architecture' with confidence 92.65%
'historic site' with confidence 89.55%
'ancient history' with confidence 89.54%
'history' with confidence 86.72%
'archaeological site' with confidence 84.41%
'travel' with confidence 65.85%
'large' with confidence 61.02%
'city' with confidence 56.57%

End of Azure AI Vision quickstart.
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)


## Next step

In this quickstart, you learned how to install the Image Analysis client library and make basic image analysis calls. Next, learn more about the Analyze Image API features.
