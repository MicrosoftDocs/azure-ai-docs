Get started with facial recognition using the Face client library for Python. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks. The Face service provides you with access to advanced algorithms for detecting and recognizing human faces in images. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic face identification using remote images.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
  * Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace"  title="Create a Face resource"  target="_blank">create a Face resource</a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, select **Go to resource**.
    * You'll need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Face API.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.


## Create environment variables

[!INCLUDE [create environment variables](../face-environment-variables.md)]

## Identify and verify faces

1. Install the client library

    After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

    ```console
    pip install --upgrade azure-ai-vision-face
    ```

1. Create a new Python application

    Create a new Python script&mdash;*quickstart-file.py*, for example. Then open it in your preferred editor or IDE and paste in the following code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you haven't received access to the Face service using the [intake form](https://aka.ms/facerecognition), some of these functions won't work.

    [!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/Face/Quickstart.py?name=snippet_single)]


1. Run your face recognition app from the application directory with the `python` command.

    ```console
    python quickstart-file.py
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > The Face API runs on a set of pre-built models that are static by nature (the model's performance will not regress or improve as the service is run). The results that the model produces might change if Microsoft updates the model's backend without migrating to an entirely new model version. To take advantage of a newer version of a model, you can retrain your **PersonGroup**, specifying the newer model as a parameter with the same enrollment images.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to use the Face client library for Python to do basic face identification. Next, learn about the different face detection models and how to specify the right model for your use case.
