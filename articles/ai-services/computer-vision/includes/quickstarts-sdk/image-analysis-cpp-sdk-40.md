Use the Image Analysis client SDK for C++ to read text from an image and generate an image caption. This quickstart calls a function, `AnalyzeImage()`, which uses the client object to analyze a remote image and print the results to the console.

[Reference documentation](/cpp/cognitive-services/vision) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-vision-sdk/tree/main/samples/cpp/image-analysis)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The current Image Analysis 4.0 client SDKs are still in private preview. We recommend you use the REST API, which is generally available (GA), until the SDKs are updated to GA.

> [!TIP]
> The Analysis 4.0 API can do many different operations. See the [Analyze Image how-to guide](../../how-to/call-analyze-image-40.md) for examples that showcase all of the available features.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)
* For Windows development, the [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with workload **Desktop development with C++** enabled.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource</a> in the Azure portal. In order to use the captioning feature in this quickstart, you must create your resource in one of the supported Azure regions: see [Region availability](./../../overview-image-analysis.md#region-availability). After it deploys, select **Go to resource**.
    * You need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Azure AI Vision service. 
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.



## Set up application

Create a new C++ application.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

Open Visual Studio, and under **Get started** select **Create a new project**. Set the template filters to _C++/Windows/Console_. Select **Console App** and choose **Next**. Update the project name to _ImageAnalysisQuickstart_ and choose **Create** to create the project.

### Install the client SDK 

Once you've created a new project, install the client SDK by right-clicking on the project solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse**, check **Include prerelease**, and search for `Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis`. Select **Install**.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

Follow the [SDK installation guide](../../sdk/install-sdk.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) to install the Image Analysis SDK for Linux.

[!INCLUDE [create environment variables](../environment-variables.md)]

## Analyze Image

From the project directory, open the _ImageAnalysisQuickstart.cpp_ file that was created previously with [your new project](#set-up-application). Clear its contents and paste in the following code:

> [!TIP]
> The code shows analyzing an image URL. You can also analyze a local image file, or an image from a memory buffer. For more information, see the [Analyze Image how-to guide](../../how-to/call-analyze-image-40.md).

[!code-cpp[](~/azure-ai-vision-sdk/docs/learn.microsoft.com/cpp/image-analysis/quick-start/quick-start.cpp?name=snippet_single)]


Then, compile and run the application by selecting **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu at the top of the IDE window (or press **F5**). You should see output similar to the one shown here.



## Output

The console output should show something similar to the following text:

```console

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure portal](../../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to install the Image Analysis client SDK and make basic image analysis calls. Next, learn more about the Analysis 4.0 API features.
