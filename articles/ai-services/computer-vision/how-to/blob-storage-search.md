# Configure your blob storage for image retrieval in Vision Studio

To get started with the **Search photos with image retrieval** scenario in Vision Studio, you need to select or create a new Azure storage account. Your storage account can be in any region, but creating it in the same region as your Vision resource is more efficient and reduces cost. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to create your storage account on the same Azure subscription as the Vision resource you're using in the **Search photos with image retrieval** scenario.

## Configure CORS rule on the storage account 

In your storage account overview, find the **Settings** section in the left hand navigation and select **Resource sharing (CORS)**, shown below.

Create a CORS rule by setting the **Allowed Origins** field to `https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com`.

In the Allowed Methods field, select the `GET` checkbox to allow an authenticated request from a different domain. In the **Max age** field, enter the value `9999`, and click **Save**.

This allows Vision Studio to access images in your blob storage container to extract insights on your data.

## Upload images in Vision Studio

In the **Search photos with image retrieval** section in Vision Studio, select the storage account that you configured with the CORS rule. Select the container in which your images are stored. If you don't have a container, you can create one and upload the images from your local device. If you have updated the CORS rules on the storage account, refresh the Blob container or Video files on container sections.
