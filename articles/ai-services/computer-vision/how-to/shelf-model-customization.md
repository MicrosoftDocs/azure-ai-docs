# Shelf product recognition - custom model (preview)

[!INCLUDE [model-customization-deprecation](../includes/model-customization-deprecation.md)]

You can train a custom model to recognize specific retail products for use in a Product Recognition scenario. The out-of-box [Analyze](shelf-analyze.md) operation doesn't differentiate between products, but you can build this capability into your app through custom labeling and training.

## Use the model customization feature

The [Model customization how-to guide](./model-customization.md) shows you how to train and publish a custom Image Analysis model. You can follow that guide, with a few specifications, to make a model for Product Recognition.

## Dataset specifications

Your training dataset should consist of images of the retail shelves. When you first create the model, you need to set the _ModelKind_ parameter to **ProductRecognitionModel**. 

Also, save the value of the _ModelName_ parameter, so you can use it as a reference later.

## Custom labeling

When you go through the labeling workflow, create labels for each of the products you want to recognize. Then label each product's bounding box, in each image.

## Analyze shelves with a custom model

When your custom model is trained and ready (you've completed the steps in the [Model customization guide](./model-customization.md)), you can use it through the Shelf Analyze operation. 

The API call will look like this:

```bash
curl.exe -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscriptionKey>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "<endpoint>/computervision/productrecognition/<your_model_name>/runs/<your_run_name>?api-version=2023-04-01-preview" -d "{
    'url':'<your_url_string>'
}"
```

1. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    1. Replace the `<subscriptionKey>` with your Vision resource key.
    1. Replace the `<endpoint>` with your Vision resource endpoint. For example: `https://YourResourceName.cognitiveservices.azure.com`.
    1. Replace `<your_model_name>` with the name of your custom model (the _ModelName_ value you used in the creation step).
    1. Replace the `<your_run_name>` with your unique test run name for the task queue. It is an async API task queue name for you to be able retrieve the API response later. For example, `.../runs/test1?api-version...`
    1. Replace the `<your_url_string>` contents with the blob URL of the image
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. Paste your edited `curl` command from the text editor into the command prompt window, and then run the command.

## Next steps

In this guide, you learned how to use a custom Product Recognition model to better meet your business needs. Next, set up planogram matching, which works in conjunction with custom Product Recognition.
