# Monitor dwell time in front of displays with Spatial Analysis 

[!INCLUDE [spatial-analysis-deprecation](includes/spatial-analysis-deprecation.md)]

Spatial Analysis can provide real-time information about how long customers spend in front of a display in a retail store. The service monitors the length of time customers spend in a zone you specify. You can use this information to track customer engagement with promotions/displays within a store or understand customers' preference toward specific products.

## Benefits for your business

In-store dwell time is an important metric to help store managers track customers' behaviors and generate insights about customers to make data-driven decisions. Tracking in-store dwell time will help store managers in the following ways:
* **Generate data-driven insights about customers**: by tracking and analyzing the time customers spend in front of specific displays, you can understand how and why customers react to your displays. 
* **Collect real-time customer reactions**: instead of sending and receiving feedback from customers, you have access to customer interaction with displays in real time.
* **Measure display/promotion effectiveness**: You can track, analyze and compare footfall and time spent by your customers to measure the effectiveness of promotions or displays.
* **Manage inventory**: You can track and monitor changes in foot traffic and time spent by your customers to modify shift plans and inventory.
* **Make data-driven decisions**: with data about your customers, you're empowered to make decisions that improve customer experience and satisfy customer needs.
