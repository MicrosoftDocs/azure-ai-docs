# People detection (version 4.0)

Version 4.0 of Image Analysis offers the ability to detect people appearing in images. The bounding box coordinates of each detected person are returned, along with a confidence score. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We built this model by enhancing our object detection model for person detection scenarios. People detection doesn't involve distinguishing one face from another face, predicting or classifying facial attributes, or creating a facial template (a unique set of numbers generated from an image that represents the distinctive features of a face).

## People detection example

The following JSON response illustrates what the Analysis 4.0 API returns when describing the example image based on its visual features.

{
  "modelVersion": "2024-02-01",

## Use the API

The people detection feature is part of the [Analyze Image 4.0 API](https://aka.ms/vision-4-0-ref). Include `People` in the **features** query parameter. Then, when you get the full JSON response, parse the string for the contents of the `"people"` section.
