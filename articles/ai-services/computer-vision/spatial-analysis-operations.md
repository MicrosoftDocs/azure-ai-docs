# Spatial Analysis operations

[!INCLUDE [spatial-analysis-deprecation](includes/spatial-analysis-deprecation.md)]

Spatial Analysis lets you analyze video streams from camera devices in real time. For each camera device you configure, the Spatial Analysis operations will generate an output stream of JSON messages sent to your instance of Azure IoT Hub.

The Spatial Analysis container implements the following operations. You can configure these operations in the deployment manifest of your container.

| Operation Identifier| Description|
|---------|---------|
| `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcount` | Counts people in a designated zone in the camera's field of view. The zone must be fully covered by a single camera in order for **PersonCount** to record an accurate total. <br> Emits an initial _personCountEvent_ event and then _personCountEvent_ events when the count changes.  |
| `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingline` | Tracks when a person crosses a designated line in the camera's field of view. <br>Emits a _personLineEvent_ event when the person crosses the line and provides directional info. 
| `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingpolygon` | Emits a _personZoneEnterExitEvent_ event when a person enters or exits the designated zone and provides directional info with the side of the zone that was crossed. Emits a _personZoneDwellTimeEvent_ when the person exits the zone and provides directional info as well as the number of milliseconds the person spent inside the zone. |
| `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-persondistance` | Tracks when people violate a minimum-distance rule. <br> Emits a _personDistanceEvent_ periodically with the location of each distance violation. |
| `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis` | The generic operation, which can be used to run all scenarios mentioned above. This option is more useful when you want to run multiple scenarios on the same camera or use system resources (the GPU, for example) more efficiently. |

All of the above operations are also available in the `.debug` version of the service (for example, `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcount.debug`). Debug has the capability to visualize video frames as they're being processed. You'll need to run `xhost +` on the host computer to enable the visualization of video frames and events.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure AI Vision AI models detect and locate human presence in video footage and output a bounding box around the human body. The AI models do not attempt to discover the identities or demographics of individuals.

## Operation parameters

The following are the parameters required by each of the Spatial Analysis operations.

| Operation parameters| Description|
|---------|---------|
| `Operation ID` | The Operation Identifier from table above.|
| `enabled` | Boolean: true or false|
| `VIDEO_URL`| The RTSP url for the camera device (Example: `rtsp://username:password@url`). Spatial Analysis supports H.264 encoded stream either through RTSP, http, or mp4. Video_URL can be provided as an obfuscated base64 string value using AES encryption, and if the video url is obfuscated then `KEY_ENV` and `IV_ENV` need to be provided as environment variables. Sample utility to generate keys and encryption can be found [here](/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.aesmanaged). |
| `VIDEO_SOURCE_ID` | A friendly name for the camera device or video stream. This will be returned with the event JSON output.|
| `VIDEO_IS_LIVE`| True for camera devices; false for recorded videos.|
| `VIDEO_DECODE_GPU_INDEX`| Which GPU to decode the video frame. By default it is 0. Should be the same as the `gpu_index` in other node config like `DETECTOR_NODE_CONFIG` and `CAMERACALIBRATOR_NODE_CONFIG`.|
| `INPUT_VIDEO_WIDTH` | Input video/stream's frame width (for example, 1920). This is an optional field and if provided, the frame will be scaled to this dimension while preserving the aspect ratio.|
| `DETECTOR_NODE_CONFIG` | JSON indicating which GPU to run the detector node on. It should be in the following format: `"{ \"gpu_index\": 0 }",`|
| `TRACKER_NODE_CONFIG` | JSON indicating whether to compute speed in the tracker node or not. It should be in the following format: `"{ \"enable_speed\": true }",`|
| `CAMERA_CONFIG` | JSON indicating the calibrated camera parameters for multiple cameras. If the skill you used requires calibration and you already have the camera parameter, you can use this config to provide them directly. Should be in the following format: `"{ \"cameras\": [{\"source_id\": \"endcomputer.0.persondistancegraph.detector+end_computer1\", \"camera_height\": 13.105561256408691, \"camera_focal_length\": 297.60003662109375, \"camera_tiltup_angle\": 0.9738943576812744}] }"`, the `source_id` is used to identify each camera. It can be gotten from the `source_info` of the event we published. It will only take effect when `do_calibration=false` in `DETECTOR_NODE_CONFIG`.|
| `CAMERACALIBRATOR_NODE_CONFIG` | JSON indicating which GPU to run the camera calibrator node on and whether to use calibration or not. It should be in the following format: `"{ \"gpu_index\": 0, \"do_calibration\": true, \"enable_orientation\": true}",`|
| `CALIBRATION_CONFIG` | JSON indicating parameters to control how the camera calibration works. It should be in the following format: `"{\"enable_recalibration\": true, \"quality_check_frequency_seconds\": 86400}",`|
| `SPACEANALYTICS_CONFIG` | JSON configuration for zone and line as outlined below.|
| `ENABLE_FACE_MASK_CLASSIFIER` | `True` to enable detecting people wearing face masks in the video stream, `False` to disable it. By default this is disabled. Face mask detection requires input video width parameter to be 1920 `"INPUT_VIDEO_WIDTH": 1920`. The face mask attribute won't be returned if detected people aren't facing the camera or are too far from it. For more information, see the [camera placement](spatial-analysis-camera-placement.md). |
| `STATIONARY_TARGET_REMOVER_CONFIG` | JSON indicating the parameters for stationary target removal, which adds the capability to learn and ignore long-term stationary false positive targets such as mannequins or people in pictures. Configuration should be in the following format: `"{\"enable\": true, \"bbox_dist_threshold-in_pixels\": 5, \"buffer_length_in_seconds\": 3600, \"filter_ratio\": 0.2 }"`|

### Detector node parameter settings

| ZonePlacementInfo Field Name | Type| Description|
|---------|---------|---------|
| `optimalZonePolygon` | object| A polygon in the camera image where lines or zones for your operations can be placed for optimal results. <br/> Each value pair represents the x,y for vertices of a polygon. The polygon represents the areas in which people are tracked or counted and polygon points are based on normalized coordinates (0-1), where the top left corner is (0.0, 0.0) and the bottom right corner is (1.0, 1.0).|
| `fairZonePolygon` | object| A polygon in the camera image where lines or zones for your operations can be placed for good, but possibly not optimal, results. <br/> See `optimalZonePolygon` above for an in-depth explanation of the contents. |
| `uniformlySpacedPersonBoundingBoxes` | list | A list of bounding boxes of people within the camera image distributed uniformly in real space. Values are based on normalized coordinates (0-1).|
| `personBoundingBoxGroundPoints` | list | A list of coordinates on the floor plane relative to the camera. Each coordinate corresponds to the bottom right of the bounding box in `uniformlySpacedPersonBoundingBoxes` with the same index. <br/> See the `centerGroundPointX/centerGroundPointY` fields under the [JSON format for cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-persondistance AI Insights](#json-format-for-persondistance-ai-insights) section for more details on how coordinates on the floor plane are calculated. |

| `type` | string| For **cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-persondistance**, this should be `persondistance`.|
| `trigger` | string| The type of trigger for sending an event. Supported values are `event` for sending events when the count changes or `interval` for sending events periodically, irrespective of whether the count has changed or not.
| `output_frequency` | int | The rate at which events are egressed. When `output_frequency` = X, every X event is egressed, ex. `output_frequency` = 2 means every other event is output. The `output_frequency` is applicable to both `event` and `interval`.|
| `minimum_distance_threshold` | float| A distance in feet that will trigger a "TooClose" event when people are less than that distance apart.|
| `maximum_distance_threshold` | float| A distance in feet that will trigger a "TooFar" event when people are greater than that distance apart.|
| `aggregation_method` | string| The method for aggregate `persondistance` result. The aggregation_method is applicable to both `mode` and `average`.|
| `focus` | string| The point location within person's bounding box used to calculate events. Focus's value can be `footprint` (the footprint of person), `bottom_center` (the bottom center of person's bounding box), `center` (the center of person's bounding box).|

| `minimumDistanceThreshold` | float| The distance in feet that will trigger a "TooClose" event when people are less than that distance apart.|
| `maximumDistanceThreshold` | float| The distance in feet that will trigger a "TooFar" event when people are greater than distance apart.|
| `eventName` | string| Event name is `TooClose` with the `minimumDistanceThreshold` is violated, `TooFar` when `maximumDistanceThreshold` is violated, or `unknown` when autocalibration hasn't completed|
| `distanceViolationPersonCount` | int| Number of people detected in violation of `minimumDistanceThreshold` or `maximumDistanceThreshold`|
| `zone` | string | The "name" field of the polygon that represents the zone that was monitored for distancing between people|
| `trigger` | string| The trigger type is 'event' or 'interval' depending on the value of `trigger` in SPACEANALYTICS_CONFIG|

| Detections Field Name | Type| Description|
|---------|---------|---------|
| `id` | string| Detection ID|

### JSON format for spatialanalysis AI Insights

Output of this operation depends on configured `events`, for example if there's a `zonecrossing` event configured for this operation then output will be same as `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingpolygon`.

## Use the output generated by the container

You may want to integrate Spatial Analysis detection or events into your application. Here are a few approaches to consider: 

* Use the Azure Event Hubs SDK for your chosen programming language to connect to the Azure IoT Hub endpoint and receive the events. For more information, see [Read device-to-cloud messages from the built-in endpoint](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin). 
* Set up **Message Routing** on your Azure IoT Hub to send the events to other endpoints or save the events to your data storage. For more information, see [IoT Hub Message Routing](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c). 
* Set up an Azure Stream Analytics job to process the events in real-time as they arrive and create visualizations. 

## Deploy Spatial Analysis operations at scale (multiple cameras)

In order to get the best performance and utilization of the GPUs, you can deploy any Spatial Analysis operations on multiple cameras using graph instances. Below is a sample configuration for running the `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingline` operation on 15 cameras.
