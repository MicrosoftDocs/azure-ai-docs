# OCR for images (version 4.0)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you want to extract text from PDFs, Office files, or HTML documents and document images, use the [Document Intelligence Read OCR model](../document-intelligence/prebuilt/read.md). It's optimized for text-heavy digital and scanned documents and uses an asynchronous API that makes it easy to power your intelligent document processing scenarios.

OCR is a machine-learning-based technique for extracting text from in-the-wild and non-document images like product labels, user-generated images, screenshots, street signs, and posters. The Azure AI Vision OCR service provides a fast, synchronous API for lightweight scenarios where images aren't text-heavy. This allows OCR to be embedded in near real-time user experiences to enrich content understanding and follow-up user actions with fast turn-around times.

## What is Azure AI Vision v4.0 Read OCR?

The new Azure AI Vision Image Analysis 4.0 REST API offers the ability to extract printed or handwritten text from images in a unified performance-enhanced synchronous API that makes it easy to get all image insights including OCR results in a single API operation. The Read OCR engine is built on top of multiple deep learning models supported by universal script-based models for [global language support](./language-support.md).


## Text extraction example

The following JSON response illustrates what the Image Analysis 4.0 API returns when extracting text from the given image.

## Use the API

The text extraction feature is part of the [Analyze Image API](https://aka.ms/vision-4-0-ref). Include `Read` in the **features** query parameter. Then, when you get the full JSON response, parse the string for the contents of the `"readResult"` section.


## Next steps

Follow the [Image Analysis quickstart](./quickstarts-sdk/image-analysis-client-library-40.md) to extract text from an image using the Image Analysis 4.0 API.
