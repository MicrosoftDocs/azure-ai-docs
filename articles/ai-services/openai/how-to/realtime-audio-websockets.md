# How to use the GPT-4o Realtime API via WebSockets (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](../includes/preview-feature.md)]

Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime API for speech and audio is part of the GPT-4o model family that supports low-latency, "speech in, speech out" conversational interactions. 

You can use the Realtime API via WebRTC or WebSocket to send audio input to the model and receive audio responses in real time. 

Follow the instructions in this article to get started with the Realtime API via WebSockets. Use the Realtime API via WebSockets in server-to-server scenarios where low latency isn't a requirement.

> [!TIP] 
> In most cases, we recommend using the [Realtime API via WebRTC](./realtime-audio-webrtc.md) for real-time audio streaming in client-side applications such as a web application or mobile app. WebRTC is designed for low-latency, real-time audio streaming and is the best choice for most use cases.

## Supported models

The GPT-4o real-time models are available for global deployments in [East US 2 and Sweden Central regions](../concepts/models.md#global-standard-model-availability).
- `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` (2024-12-17)
- `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` (2024-12-17)

You should use API version `2025-04-01-preview` in the URL for the Realtime API. 

For more information about supported models, see the [models and versions documentation](../concepts/models.md#audio-models).

## Prerequisites

Before you can use GPT-4o real-time audio, you need:

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- An Azure OpenAI resource created in a [supported region](#supported-models). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](create-resource.md).
- You need a deployment of the `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` or `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` model in a supported region as described in the [supported models](#supported-models) section. You can deploy the model from the [Azure AI Foundry portal model catalog](../../../ai-foundry/how-to/model-catalog-overview.md) or from your project in Azure AI Foundry portal. 

## Connection and authentication

The Realtime API (via `/realtime`) is built on [the WebSockets API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to facilitate fully asynchronous streaming communication between the end user and model. 

The Realtime API is accessed via a secure WebSocket connection to the `/realtime` endpoint of your Azure OpenAI resource.

You can construct a full request URI by concatenating:

- The secure WebSocket (`wss://`) protocol.
- Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint hostname, for example, `my-aoai-resource.openai.azure.com`
- The `openai/realtime` API path.
- An `api-version` query string parameter for a supported API version such as `2024-12-17`
- A `deployment` query string parameter with the name of your `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` or `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` model deployment.

The following example is a well-constructed `/realtime` request URI:

```http
wss://my-eastus2-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/realtime?api-version=2025-04-01-preview&deployment=gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview-deployment-name
```

To authenticate:
- **Microsoft Entra** (recommended): Use token-based authentication with the `/realtime` API for an Azure OpenAI resource with managed identity enabled. Apply a retrieved authentication token using a `Bearer` token with the `Authorization` header.
- **API key**: An `api-key` can be provided in one of two ways:
  - Using an `api-key` connection header on the prehandshake connection. This option isn't available in a browser environment.
  - Using an `api-key` query string parameter on the request URI. Query string parameters are encrypted when using https/wss.

## Realtime API via WebSockets architecture

Once the WebSocket connection session to `/realtime` is established and authenticated, the functional interaction takes place via events for sending and receiving WebSocket messages. These events each take the form of a JSON object.

-->

Events can be sent and received in parallel and applications should generally handle them both concurrently and asynchronously.

- A client-side caller establishes a connection to `/realtime`, which starts a new [`session`](../realtime-audio-reference.md#realtimerequestsession).
- A `session` automatically creates a default `conversation`. Multiple concurrent conversations aren't supported.
- The `conversation` accumulates input signals until a `response` is started, either via a direct event by the caller or automatically by voice activity detection (VAD).
- Each `response` consists of one or more `items`, which can encapsulate messages, function calls, and other information.
- Each message `item` has `content_part`, allowing multiple modalities (text and audio) to be represented across a single item.
- The `session` manages configuration of caller input handling (for example, user audio) and common output generation handling.
- Each caller-initiated [`response.create`](../realtime-audio-reference.md#realtimeclienteventresponsecreate) can override some of the output [`response`](../realtime-audio-reference.md#realtimeresponse) behavior, if desired.
- Server-created `item` and the `content_part` in messages can be populated asynchronously and in parallel. For example, receiving audio, text, and function information concurrently in a round robin fashion.

## Try the quickstart

Now that you have the prerequisites, you can follow the instructions in the [Realtime API quickstart](../realtime-audio-quickstart.md) to get started with the Realtime API via WebSockets.
