# Migrating to the OpenAI JavaScript API library 4.x

As of June 2024, we recommend migrating to the OpenAI JavaScript API library 4.x, the latest version of the official OpenAI JavaScript client library that supports the Azure OpenAI Service API version `2022-12-01` and later. This article helps you bring you up to speed on the changes specific to Azure OpenAI.

## Authenticating the client

There are several ways to authenticate API requests to Azure OpenAI. We highly recommend using Microsoft Entra ID tokens. See the [Azure Identity documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/identity/identity/README.md) for more information.

### Microsoft Entra ID

There are several ways to authenticate with the Azure OpenAI service using Microsoft Entra ID tokens. The default way is to use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class from the `@azure/identity` package, but your application might be using a different credential class. For the purposes of this guide, we assume that you are using the `DefaultAzureCredential` class. A credential can be created as follows:

```typescript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
```

This object is then passed to the second argument of the `OpenAIClient` and `AssistantsClient` client constructors.

In order to authenticate the `AzureOpenAI` client, however, we need to use the `getBearerTokenProvider` function from the `@azure/identity` package. This function creates a token provider that `AzureOpenAI` uses internally to obtain tokens for each request. The token provider is created as follows:

```typescript
import { DefaultAzureCredential, getBearerTokenProvider } from "@azure/identity";
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const scope = "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default";
const azureADTokenProvider = getBearerTokenProvider(credential, scope);
```

`azureADTokenProvider` is passed to the options object when creating the `AzureOpenAI` client.

### (Highly Discouraged) API Key

API keys are not recommended for production use because they are less secure than other authentication methods. Previously, `AzureKeyCredential` objects were created as follows to authenticate `OpenAIClient` or `AssistantsClient`:

```typescript
import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/openai";
const apiKey = new AzureKeyCredential("your API key");
```

On the other hand, `AzureOpenAI` can be authenticated with an API key by setting the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or by setting the `apiKey` string property in the options object when creating the `AzureOpenAI` client.

## Constructing the client

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
import { AzureOpenAI } from "openai";
const deployment = "Your Azure OpenAI deployment";
const apiVersion = "2024-04-01-preview";
const options = { azureADTokenProvider, deployment, apiVersion }
const client = new AzureOpenAI(options);
```

The endpoint of the Azure OpenAI resource can be specified by setting the `endpoint` option but it can also be loaded by the client from the environment variable `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`. This is the recommended way to set the endpoint because it allows the client to be used in different environments without changing the code and also to protect the endpoint from being exposed in the code.

The API version is required to be specified, this is necessary to ensure that existing code doesn't break between preview API versions. Refer to [API versioning documentation](../api-version-deprecation.md) to learn more about Azure OpenAI API versions. Additionally, the `deployment` property isn't required but it's recommended to be set. Once `deployment` is set, it's used as the default deployment for all operations that require it. If the client isn't created with the `deployment` option, the `model` property in the options object should be set with the deployment name. However, audio operations such as `audio.transcriptions.create` require the client to be created with the `deployment` option set to the deployment name.

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
import { OpenAIClient } from "@azure/openai";
const endpoint = "Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint";
const client = new OpenAIClient(endpoint, credential);
```

If not set, the API version defaults to the last known one before the release of the client. The client is also not locked to a single model deployment, meaning that the deployment name has to be passed to each method that requires it.

---

## API differences

There are key differences between the `OpenAIClient` and `AssistantsClient` clients and the `AzureOpenAI` client:

- Operations are represented as a flat list of methods in both `OpenAIClient` and `AssistantsClient`, for example `client.getChatCompletions`. In `AzureOpenAI`, operations are grouped in nested groups, for example `client.chat.completions.create`.
- `OpenAIClient` and `AssistantsClient` rename many of the names used in the Azure OpenAI service API. For example, snake case is used in the API but camel case is used in the client. In `AzureOpenAI`, names are kept the same as in the Azure OpenAI service API.

## Migration examples

The following sections provide examples of how to migrate from `OpenAIClient` and `AssistantsClient` to `AzureOpenAI`.

### Chat completions

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
const result = await client.chat.completions.create({ messages, model: '', max_tokens: 100 });
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const result = await client.getChatCompletions(deploymentName, messages, { maxTokens: 100 });
```

---

Note the following:
- The `getChatCompletions` method has been replaced with the `chat.completions.create` method.
- The `messages` parameter is now passed in the options object with the `messages` property.
- The `maxTokens` property has been renamed to `max_tokens` and the `deploymentName` parameter has been removed. Generally, the names of the properties in the `options` object are the same as in the Azure OpenAI service API, following the snake case convention instead of the camel case convention used in the `AssistantsClient`. This is true for all the properties across all requests and responses in the `AzureOpenAI` client.
- The `deploymentName` parameter isn't needed if the client was created with the `deployment` option. If the client was not created with the `deployment` option, the `model` property in the option object should be set with the deployment name.

### Streaming chat completions

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
const stream = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: '', messages, max_tokens: 100, stream: true });
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const stream = await client.streamChatCompletions(deploymentName, messages, { maxTokens: 100 });
```

---



### Azure On Your Data

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
import "@azure/openai/types";

const azureSearchEndpoint = "Your Azure Search resource endpoint";
const azureSearchIndexName = "Your Azure Search index name";
const result = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: '', messages, data_sources: [{
      type: "azure_search",
      parameters: {
        endpoint: azureSearchEndpoint,
        index_name: azureSearchIndexName,
        authentication: {
          type: "system_assigned_managed_identity",
        }
      }
    }]
});
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const azureSearchEndpoint = "Your Azure Search resource endpoint";
const azureSearchIndexName = "Your Azure Search index name";
const result = await client.getChatCompletions(deploymentName, messages, { azureExtensionOptions: { 
    data_sources: [{
      type: "azure_search",
      endpoint: azureSearchEndpoint,
      indexName: azureSearchIndexName,
      authentication: {
        type: "system_assigned_managed_identity",
      }
    }]
  } 
});
```

---

- `"@azure/openai/types"` is imported which adds Azure-specific definitions (for example, `data_sources`) to the client types.
- The `azureExtensionOptions` property has been replaced with the inner `data_sources` property.
- The `parameters` property has been added to wrap the parameters of the extension, which mirrors the schema of the Azure OpenAI service API.
- Camel case properties have been replaced with snake case properties.

### Audio transcription

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
import { createReadStream } from "fs";

const result = await client.audio.transcriptions.create({
  model: '',
  file: createReadStream(audioFilePath),
});
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";

const audioFilePath = "path/to/audio/file";
const audio = await readFile(audioFilePath);
const result = await client.getAudioTranscription(deploymentName, audio);
```

---



- The `getAudioTranscription` method has been replaced with the `audio.transcriptions.create` method.
- The `AzureOpenAI` has to be constructed with the `deployment` option set to the deployment name in order to use audio operations such as `audio.transcriptions.create`.
- The `model` property is required to be set in the options object but its value isn't used in the operation so feel free to set it to any value.
- The `file` property accepts various types including `Buffer`, `fs.ReadaStream`, and `Blob` but in this example, a file is streamed from disk using `fs.createReadStream`.

### Audio translation

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
import { createReadStream } from "fs";

const result = await client.audio.translations.create({
  model: '',
  file: createReadStream(audioFilePath),
});
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";

const audioFilePath = "path/to/audio/file";
const audio = await readFile(audioFilePath);
const result = await client.getAudioTranslation(deploymentName, audio);
```

---


- The `getAudioTranslation` method has been replaced with the `audio.translations.create` method.
- All other changes are the same as in the audio transcription example.

### Assistants

The following examples show how to migrate some of the `AssistantsClient` methods.

#### Assistant creation

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
const options = ...;
const assistantResponse = await assistantsClient.beta.assistants.create(
  options
);
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const options = {
  model: azureOpenAIDeployment,
  name: "Math Tutor",
  instructions:
    "You are a personal math tutor. Write and run JavaScript code to answer math questions.",
  tools: [{ type: "code_interpreter" }],
};
const assistantResponse = await assistantsClient.createAssistant(options);
```

---



- The `createAssistant` method has been replaced with the `beta.assistants.create` method

#### Thread creation

The following example shows how to migrate the `createThread` method call.

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
const assistantThread = await assistantsClient.beta.threads.create();
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const assistantThread = await assistantsClient.createThread();
```

---



- The `createThread` method has been replaced with the `beta.threads.create` method

#### Message creation

The following example shows how to migrate the `createMessage` method call.

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
const threadResponse = await assistantsClient.beta.threads.messages.create(
  assistantThread.id,
  {
    role,
    content: message,
  }
);
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const threadResponse = await assistantsClient.createMessage(
  assistantThread.id,
  role,
  message
);
```

---


- The `createMessage` method has been replaced with the `beta.threads.messages.create` method.
- The message specification has been moved from a parameter list to an object.

#### Runs

To run an assistant on a thread, the `createRun` method is used to create a run, and then a loop is used to poll the run status until it is in a terminal state. The following example shows how to migrate the run creation and polling.

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

This code can be migrated and simplified by using the `createAndPoll` method, which creates a run and polls it until it is in a terminal state.

```typescript
const runResponse = await assistantsClient.beta.threads.runs.createAndPoll(
  assistantThread.id,
  {
    assistant_id: assistantResponse.id,
  },
  { pollIntervalMs: 500 }
);
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
let runResponse = await assistantsClient.createRun(assistantThread.id, {
  assistantId: assistantResponse.id,
});

do {
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 500));
  runResponse = await assistantsClient.getRun(
    assistantThread.id,
    runResponse.id
  );
} while (
  runResponse.status === "queued" ||
  runResponse.status === "in_progress"
```

---



- The `createRun` method has been replaced with the `beta.threads.runs.create` and `createAndPoll` methods.
- The `createAndPoll` method is used to create a run and poll it until it is in a terminal state.

#### Processing Run results

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

Pages can be looped through by using the `for await` loop.

```typescript
for await (const runMessageDatum of runMessages) {
  for (const item of runMessageDatum.content) {
    ...
  }
}
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

Without paging, results had to be accessed manually page by page using the `data` property of the response object. For instance, accessing the first page can be done as follows:

```typescript
for (const runMessageDatum of runMessages.data) {
  for (const item of runMessageDatum.content) {
    ...
  }
}
```

---


### Embeddings

The following example shows how to migrate the `getEmbeddings` method call.

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
const embeddings = await client.embeddings.create({ input, model: '' });
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const embeddings = await client.getEmbeddings(deploymentName, input);
```

---


- The `getEmbeddings` method has been replaced with the `embeddings.create` method.
- The `input` parameter is now passed in the options object with the `input` property.
- The `deploymentName` parameter has been removed. The `deploymentName` parameter isn't needed if the client was created with the `deployment` option. If the client was not created with the `deployment` option, the `model` property in the option object should be set with the deployment name.

### Image generation

The following example shows how to migrate the `getImages` method call.

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
  const results = await client.images.generate({ prompt, model: '', n, size });
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const results = await client.getImages(deploymentName, prompt, { n, size });
```

---



- The `getImages` method has been replaced with the `images.generate` method.
- The `prompt` parameter is now passed in the options object with the `prompt` property.
- The `deploymentName` parameter has been removed. The `deploymentName` parameter isn't needed if the client was created with the `deployment` option. If the client was not created with the `deployment` option, the `model` property in the option object should be set with the deployment name.

### Content filter

Content filter results are part of the chat completions response types in `OpenAIClient`. However, `AzureOpenAI` does not have a direct equivalent to the `contentFilterResults` property in the `ChatCompletion.Choice` interface. The content filter results can be accessed by importing `"@azure/openai/types"` and accessing the `content_filter_results` property. The following example shows how to access the content filter results.

# [OpenAI JavaScript (new)](#tab/javascript-new)

```typescript
import "@azure/openai/types";

const result = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: '', messages });
for (const choice of results.choices) {
  const filterResults = choice.content_filter_results;
  if (!filterResults) {
    console.log("No content filter is found");
    return;
  }
  if (filterResults.error) {
    console.log(
      `Content filter ran into the error ${filterResults.error.code}: ${filterResults.error.message}`);
  }
  const { hate, sexual, self_harm, violence } = filterResults;
  ...
}
```

# [Azure OpenAI JavaScript (previous)](#tab/javascript-old)

```typescript
const results = await client.getChatCompletions(deploymentName, messages);
for (const choice of results.choices) {
  if (!choice.contentFilterResults) {
    console.log("No content filter is found");
    return;
  }
  if (choice.contentFilterResults.error) {
    console.log(
      `Content filter ran into the error ${choice.contentFilterResults.error.code}: ${choice.contentFilterResults.error.message}`);
  }
  const { hate, sexual, selfHarm, violence } = choice.contentFilterResults;
  ...
}
```

---


- Camel case properties have been replaced with snake case properties.
- `"@azure/openai/types"` is imported which adds Azure-specific definitions (for example, content_filter_results) to the client types, see the [Azure types](#azure-types) section for more information.

## Azure types

`AzureOpenAI` connects to the Azure OpenAI service and can call all the operations available in the service. However, the types of the requests and responses are inherited from the `OpenAI` and are not yet updated to reflect the additional features supported exclusively by the Azure OpenAI service. TypeScript users will need to import `"@azure/openai/types"` from `@azure/openai@2.0.0-beta.1` which will merge Azure-specific definitions into existing types. Examples in [the Migration examples](#migration-examples) section show how to do this.
