## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI or Azure AI Search resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure AI services resources](../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure AI Search resources](/azure/search/search-get-started-portal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure app service resources](/azure/app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore?pivots=development-environment-vs#clean-up-resources)
