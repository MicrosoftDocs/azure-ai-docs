# Default content safety policies


Azure OpenAI Service includes default safety policies applied to all models, excluding Azure OpenAI Whisper. These configurations provide you with a responsible experience by default, including [content filtering models](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter?tabs=warning%2Cpython-new), blocklists, prompt transformation, [content credentials](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-credentials), and others.

Default safety aims to mitigate risks in different categories such as hate and fairness, sexual, violence, self-harm, protected material content, and user prompt injection attacks. To learn more about content filtering, visit our documentation describing [categories and severity levels](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter?tabs=warning%2Cpython-new).

All safety policies are configurable. To learn more about configurability, see the documentation on [configuring content filtering](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/content-filters).

## Text models

Text models in the Azure OpenAI Service can take in and generate both text and code. These models leverage Azure’s text content filters to detect and prevent harmful content. This system works on both prompts and completions. 

| Risk Category                             | Prompt/Completion      | Severity Threshold |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Hate and Fairness                         | Prompts and Completions| Medium              |
| Violence                                  | Prompts and Completions| Medium              |
| Sexual                                    | Prompts and Completions| Medium              |
| Self-Harm                                 | Prompts and Completions| Medium              |
| User prompt injection attack (Jailbreak)  | Prompts                | N/A                 |
| Protected Material – Text                 | Completions            | N/A                 |
| Protected Material – Code                 | Completions            | N/A                 |

In addition to the above safety configurations, Azure OpenAI DALL-E also comes with [prompt transformation](./prompt-transformation.md) by default. This transformation occurs on all prompts to enhance the safety of your original prompt, specifically in the risk categories of diversity, deceptive generation of political candidates, depictions of public figures, protected material, and others.
