# Azure OpenAI Service deprecated models

Azure OpenAI Service offers a variety of models for different use cases. The following models were deprecated on July 6, 2023 and will be retired on June 14, 2024.  These models are no longer available for new deployments. Deployments created prior to July 6, 2023 remain available to customers until June 14, 2024. We recommend customers migrate their applications to deployments of replacement models prior to the June 14, 2024 retirement.

At the time of retirement, deployments of these models will stop returning valid API responses.

## GPT-3.5

The impacted GPT-3.5 models are the following. The replacement for the GPT-3.5 models is GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct when that model becomes available.

- `text-davinci-002`
- `text-davinci-003`
- `code-davinci-002`

## GPT-3 

The impacted GPT-3 models are the following. The replacement for the GPT-3 models is GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct when that model becomes available.

- `text-ada-001`
- `text-babbage-001`
- `text-curie-001`
- `text-davinci-001`
- `code-cushman-001`

## Embedding models

The embedding models below will be retired effective June 14, 2024. Customers should migrate to `text-embedding-ada-002` (version 2).

- [Similarity](#similarity-embedding)
- [Text search](#text-search-embedding)
- [Code search](#code-search-embedding)

Each family includes models across a range of capability. The following list indicates the length of the numerical vector returned by the service, based on model capability:

|  Base Model  |  Model(s)  |  Dimensions  |
|---|---|---|
| Ada | | 1,024 |
| Babbage |  | 2,048 |
| Curie |  | 4,096 |
| Davinci |  | 12,288 |


### Similarity embedding

These models are good at capturing semantic similarity between two or more pieces of text.

| Use cases | Models |
|---|---|
| Clustering, regression, anomaly detection, visualization | `text-similarity-ada-001` <br> `text-similarity-babbage-001` <br> `text-similarity-curie-001` <br> `text-similarity-davinci-001` <br>|

### Text search embedding

These models help measure whether long documents are relevant to a short search query. There are two input types supported by this family: `doc`, for embedding the documents to be retrieved, and `query`, for embedding the search query.

| Use cases | Models |
|---|---|
| Search, context relevance, information retrieval | `text-search-ada-doc-001` <br> `text-search-ada-query-001` <br> `text-search-babbage-doc-001` <br> `text-search-babbage-query-001` <br> `text-search-curie-doc-001` <br> `text-search-curie-query-001` <br> `text-search-davinci-doc-001` <br> `text-search-davinci-query-001` <br> |

### Code search embedding

Similar to text search embedding models, there are two input types supported by this family: `code`, for embedding code snippets to be retrieved, and `text`, for embedding natural language search queries.

| Use cases | Models |
|---|---|
| Code search and relevance | `code-search-ada-code-001` <br> `code-search-ada-text-001` <br> `code-search-babbage-code-001` <br> `code-search-babbage-text-001` |

## Model summary table and region availability

Region availability is for customers with deployments of the models prior to July 6, 2023.
