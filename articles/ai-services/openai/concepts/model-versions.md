# Azure OpenAI Service model versions

Azure OpenAI Service is committed to providing the best generative AI models for customers. As part of this commitment, Azure OpenAI Service regularly releases new model versions to incorporate the latest features and improvements from OpenAI.

## How model versions work

We want to make it easy for customers to stay up to date as models improve.  Customers can choose to start with a particular version and to automatically update as new versions are released.

When you deploy a model you can choose an update policy, which can include the following options:

* Deployments set to **Auto-update to default** automatically update to use the new default version.
* Deployments set to **Upgrade when expired** automatically update when its current version is retired.
* Deployments that are set to **No Auto Upgrade** stop working when the model is retired.

## How Azure updates OpenAI models

Azure works closely with OpenAI to release new model versions.  When a new version of a model is released, a customer can immediately test it in new deployments.  Azure publishes when new versions of models are released, and notifies customers at least two weeks before a new version becomes the default version of the model.   Azure also maintains the previous major version of the model until its retirement date, so customers can switch back to it if desired.

## What you need to know about Azure OpenAI model version upgrades

As a customer of Azure OpenAI models, you might notice some changes in the model behavior and compatibility after a version upgrade.  These changes might affect your applications and workflows that rely on the models.  Here are some tips to help you prepare for version upgrades and minimize the impact:

* Read [whatâ€™s new](../whats-new.md) and [models](../concepts/models.md) to understand the changes and new features.
* Read the documentation on [model deployments](../how-to/create-resource.md) and [version upgrades](../how-to/working-with-models.md) to understand how to work with model versions.
* Test your applications and workflows with the new model version after release.
* Update your code and configuration to use the new features and capabilities of the new model version.
