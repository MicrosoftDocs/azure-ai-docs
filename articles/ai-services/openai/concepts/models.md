# Azure OpenAI Service models

Azure OpenAI Service is powered by a diverse set of models with different capabilities and price points. Model availability varies by region and cloud. For Azure Government model availability, please refer to [Azure Government OpenAI Service](../azure-government.md).

| Models | Description |
|--|--|
| [GPT-4o & GPT-4o mini & GPT-4 Turbo](#gpt-4o-and-gpt-4-turbo) | The latest most capable Azure OpenAI models with multimodal versions, which can accept both text and images as input. |
| [GPT-4](#gpt-4) | A set of models that improve on GPT-3.5 and can understand and generate natural language and code. |
| [GPT-3.5](#gpt-35) | A set of models that improve on GPT-3 and can understand and generate natural language and code. |
| [Embeddings](#embeddings-models) | A set of models that can convert text into numerical vector form to facilitate text similarity. |
| [DALL-E](#dall-e-models) | A series of models that can generate original images from natural language. |
| [Whisper](#whisper-models) | A series of models in preview that can transcribe and translate speech to text. |
| [Text to speech](#text-to-speech-models-preview) (Preview) | A series of models in preview that can synthesize text to speech. |

## GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo

GPT-4o integrates text and images in a single model, enabling it to handle multiple data types simultaneously. This multimodal approach enhances accuracy and responsiveness in human-computer interactions. GPT-4o matches GPT-4 Turbo in English text and coding tasks while offering superior performance in non-English languages and vision tasks, setting new benchmarks for AI capabilities.

### How do I access the GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models?

GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini are available for **standard** and **global-standard** model deployment.

You need to [create](../how-to/create-resource.md) or use an existing resource in a [supported standard](#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-model-availability) or [global standard](#global-standard-model-availability) region where the model is available.

When your resource is created, you can [deploy](../how-to/create-resource.md#deploy-a-model) the GPT-4o models. If you are performing a programmatic deployment, the **model** names are:

- `gpt-4o` **Version** `2024-08-06`
- `gpt-4o`, **Version**  `2024-05-13`
- `gpt-4o-mini` **Version** `2024-07-18`

### GPT-4 Turbo

GPT-4 Turbo is a large multimodal model (accepting text or image inputs and generating text) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of OpenAI's previous models. Like GPT-3.5 Turbo, and older GPT-4 models GPT-4 Turbo is optimized for chat and works well for traditional completions tasks.

[!INCLUDE [GPT-4 Turbo](../includes/gpt-4-turbo.md)]

## GPT-4

GPT-4 is the predecessor to GPT-4 Turbo. Both the GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models have a base model name of `gpt-4`. You can distinguish between the GPT-4 and Turbo models by examining the model version.

- `gpt-4` **Version** `0314`
- `gpt-4` **Version** `0613`
- `gpt-4-32k` **Version** `0613`

You can see the token context length supported by each model in the [model summary table](#model-summary-table-and-region-availability).

## GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models

- These models can only be used with the Chat Completion API.

See [model versions](../concepts/model-versions.md) to learn about how Azure OpenAI Service handles model version upgrades, and [working with models](../how-to/working-with-models.md) to learn how to view and configure the model version settings of your GPT-4 deployments.

> [!CAUTION]
> We don't recommend using preview models in production. We will upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable/GA version. Models designated preview do not follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

- GPT-4 version 0125-preview is an updated version of the GPT-4 Turbo preview previously released as version 1106-preview.  
- GPT-4 version 0125-preview completes tasks such as code generation more completely compared to gpt-4-1106-preview. Because of this, depending on the task, customers may find that GPT-4-0125-preview generates more output compared to the gpt-4-1106-preview.  We recommend customers compare the outputs of the new model.  GPT-4-0125-preview also addresses bugs in gpt-4-1106-preview with UTF-8 handling for non-English languages. 
- GPT-4 version `turbo-2024-04-09` is the latest GA release and replaces `0125-Preview`, `1106-preview`, and `vision-preview`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - `gpt-4` versions 1106-Preview, 0125-Preview, and vision-preview will be upgraded with a stable version of `gpt-4` in the future. Deployments of `gpt-4` versions 1106-Preview, 0125-Preview, and vision-preview set to "Auto-update to default" and "Upgrade when expired" will start to be upgraded after the stable version is released. For each deployment, a model version upgrade takes place with no interruption in service for API calls.  Upgrades are staged by region and the full upgrade process is expected to take 2 weeks. Deployments of `gpt-4` versions 1106-Preview, 0125-Preview, and vision-preview set to "No autoupgrade" will not be upgraded and will stop operating when the preview version is upgraded in the region. See [Azure OpenAI model retirements and deprecations](./model-retirements.md) for more information on the timing of the upgrade.

## GPT-3.5

GPT-3.5 models can understand and generate natural language or code. The most capable and cost effective model in the GPT-3.5 family is GPT-3.5 Turbo, which has been optimized for chat and works well for traditional completions tasks as well. GPT-3.5 Turbo is available for use with the Chat Completions API. GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct has similar capabilities to `text-davinci-003` using the Completions API instead of the Chat Completions API.  We recommend using GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct over [legacy GPT-3.5 and GPT-3 models](./legacy-models.md).


|  Model ID   | Description | Max Request (tokens) | Training Data (up to) |
|  --------- |:---|:------:|:----:|
| `gpt-35-turbo` (0125) **NEW** | **Latest GA Model** <br> - JSON Mode <br> - parallel function calling <br> - reproducible output (preview) <br> - Higher accuracy at responding in requested formats. <br> - Fix for a bug which caused a text encoding issue for non-English language function calls.  | Input: 16,385<br> Output: 4,096  | Sep 2021 |
| `gpt-35-turbo` (1106) | **Older GA Model** <br> - JSON Mode <br> - parallel function calling <br> - reproducible output (preview) | Input: 16,385<br> Output: 4,096 |  Sep 2021|
| `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` (0914) | **Completions endpoint only** <br> - Replacement for [legacy completions models](./legacy-models.md) | 4,097 |Sep 2021 |
| `gpt-35-turbo-16k` (0613) | **Older GA Model** <br> - Basic function calling with tools | 16,384 | Sep 2021 |
| `gpt-35-turbo` (0613) | **Older GA Model** <br> - Basic function calling with tools   | 4,096 | Sep 2021 |
| `gpt-35-turbo`**<sup>1</sup>** (0301) |  **Older GA Model**  <br> - [Retirement information](./model-retirements.md#current-models) | 4,096 | Sep 2021 |

To learn more about how to interact with GPT-3.5 Turbo and the Chat Completions API check out our [in-depth how-to](../how-to/chatgpt.md).

**<sup>1</sup>** This model will accept requests > 4,096 tokens. It is not recommended to exceed the 4,096 input token limit as the newer version of the model are capped at 4,096 tokens. If you encounter issues when exceeding 4,096 input tokens with this model this configuration is not officially supported.

## Embeddings

 `text-embedding-3-large` is the latest and most capable embedding model. Upgrading between embeddings models is not possible. In order to move from using `text-embedding-ada-002` to `text-embedding-3-large` you would need to generate new embeddings. 

- `text-embedding-3-large`
- `text-embedding-3-small`
- `text-embedding-ada-002`

In testing, OpenAI reports both the large and small third generation embeddings models offer better average multi-language retrieval performance with the [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl) benchmark while still maintaining performance for English tasks with the [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) benchmark.

|Evaluation Benchmark| `text-embedding-ada-002` | `text-embedding-3-small` |`text-embedding-3-large` |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIRACL average | 31.4 | 44.0 | 54.9 |
| MTEB average | 61.0 | 62.3 | 64.6 |

The third generation embeddings models support reducing the size of the embedding via a new `dimensions` parameter. Typically larger embeddings are more expensive from a compute, memory, and storage perspective. Being able to adjust the number of dimensions allows more control over overall cost and performance. The `dimensions` parameter is not supported in all versions of the OpenAI 1.x Python library, to take advantage of this parameter  we recommend upgrading to the latest version: `pip install openai --upgrade`.

OpenAI's MTEB benchmark testing found that even when the third generation model's dimensions are reduced to less than `text-embeddings-ada-002` 1,536 dimensions performance remains slightly better.

## DALL-E

The DALL-E models generate images from text prompts that the user provides. DALL-E 3 is generally available for use with the REST APIs. DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 with client SDKs are in preview.

## Whisper

The Whisper models can be used for speech to text.

You can also use the Whisper model via Azure AI Speech [batch transcription](../../speech-service/batch-transcription-create.md) API. Check out [What is the Whisper model?](../../speech-service/whisper-overview.md) to learn more about when to use Azure AI Speech vs. Azure OpenAI Service.

## Text to speech (Preview)

The OpenAI text to speech models, currently in preview, can be used to synthesize text to speech.

You can also use the OpenAI text to speech voices via Azure AI Speech. To learn more, see [OpenAI text to speech voices via Azure OpenAI Service or via Azure AI Speech](../../speech-service/openai-voices.md#openai-text-to-speech-voices-via-azure-openai-service-or-via-azure-ai-speech) guide.
