# Quickstart: Speech to text with the Azure OpenAI Whisper model

This quickstart explains how to use the [Azure OpenAI Whisper model](../speech-service/whisper-overview.md) for speech to text conversion. The Whisper model can transcribe human speech in numerous languages, and it can also translate other languages into English.

The file size limit for the Whisper model is 25 MB. If you need to transcribe a file larger than 25 MB, you can use the Azure AI Speech [batch transcription](../speech-service/batch-transcription-create.md#use-a-whisper-model) API.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure portal](../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)

## Next steps

* To learn how to convert audio data to text in batches, see [Create a batch transcription](../speech-service/batch-transcription-create.md).
* For more examples, check out the [Azure OpenAI Samples GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AOAICodeSamples).
