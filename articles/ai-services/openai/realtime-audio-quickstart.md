# GPT-4o Realtime API for speech and audio (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](includes/preview-feature.md)]

Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime API for speech and audio is part of the GPT-4o model family that supports low-latency, "speech in, speech out" conversational interactions. The GPT-4o audio `realtime` API is designed to handle real-time, low-latency conversational interactions, making it a great fit for use cases involving live interactions between a user and a model, such as customer support agents, voice assistants, and real-time translators.

Most users of the Realtime API need to deliver and receive audio from an end-user in real time, including applications that use WebRTC or a telephony system. The Realtime API isn't designed to connect directly to end user devices and relies on client integrations to terminate end user audio streams. 

## Supported models

The GPT 4o real-time models are available for global deployments.
- `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` (version `2024-12-17`)
- `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` (version `2024-12-17`)

See the [models and versions documentation](./concepts/models.md#audio-models) for more information.

## API support

Support for the Realtime API was first added in API version `2024-10-01-preview` (retired). Use version `2025-04-01-preview` to access the latest Realtime API features.
