### Supported metrics for Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts

Here are the most important metrics we think you should monitor for Azure OpenAI. Later in this article is a longer list of all available Azure AI services metrics which contains more details on metrics in this shorter list.

- Azure OpenAI Requests
- Active Tokens
- Generated Completion Tokens
- Processed FineTuned Training Hours
- Processed Inference Tokens
- Processed Prompt Tokens
- Provisioned-managed Utilization V2
- Prompt Token Cache Match Rate
- Time to Response
- Time Between Tokens

- Time to Last Byte

- Normalized Time to First Byte 

You can also monitor Content Safety metrics that are used by other Azure AI services. 
- Blocked Volume
- Harmful Volume Detected
- Potential Abusive User Count
- Safety System Event
- Total Volume Sent for Safety Check 


> [!NOTE]
> The **Provisioned-managed Utilization** metric is now deprecated and is no longer recommended. This metric has been replaced by the **Provisioned-managed Utilization V2** metric.

Cognitive Services metrics have the category **Cognitive Services - HTTP Requests** in the following table. These metrics are legacy metrics that are common to all Azure AI Services resources. Microsoft no longer recommends that you use these metrics with Azure OpenAI.

The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts resource type.
