# Assistants API (Preview) runs reference

[!INCLUDE [Assistants v2 note](includes/assistants-v2-note.md)]

This article provides reference documentation for Python and REST for the new Assistants API (Preview). More in-depth step-by-step guidance is provided in the [getting started guide](./how-to/assistant.md).

## Create run

```http
POST https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/threads/{thread_id}/runs?api-version=2024-08-01-preview
```

Create a run.

**Path parameter**

|Parameter| Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|`thread_id` | string | Required | The ID of the thread to create a message for. |

**Request body**

|Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---  |---   |---       |--- |
| `assistant_id` | string | Required | The ID of the assistant to use to execute this run. |
| `model` | string or null | Optional | The model deployment name to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model deployment name associated with the assistant. If not, the model deployment name associated with the assistant will be used. |
| `instructions` | string or null | Optional | Overrides the instructions of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis. |
| `additional_instructions` | string | Optional | Appends additional instructions at the end of the instructions for the run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis without overriding other instructions. |
| `additional_messages` | array | Optional | Adds additional messages to the thread before creating the run. |
| `tools` | array or null | Optional | Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis. |
| `metadata` | map | Optional | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long. |
| `temperature` | number | Optional | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. Default is 1. |
| `top_p` | number | Optional | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. Default is 1. |
| `stream` | boolean | optional | If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message. |
| `max_prompt_tokens` | integer | optional | The maximum number of completion tokens that might be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. |
| `max_completion_tokens` | integer | optional | The maximum number of completion tokens that might be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. |
| `truncation_strategy` | [truncationObject](#truncation-object) | optional | Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the initial context window of the run. |
| `tool_choice` | string or object | optional | Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. A `none` value means the model won't call any tools and instead generates a message. `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool. Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool. |
| `response_format` | string or object | optional | Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`. <br> Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON. <br> **Important**: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model might generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content might be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length. |

## Run object

Represents an execution run on a thread.

|Name | Type | Description |
|---  |---   |---         |
| `id`| string | The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.|
| `object` | string | The object type, which is always thread.run.|
| `created_at` | integer | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was created.|
| `thread_id` | string | The ID of the thread that was executed on as a part of this run.|
| `assistant_id` | string | The ID of the assistant used for execution of this run.|
| `status` | string | The status of the run, which can be either `queued`, `in_progress`, `requires_action`, `cancelling`, `cancelled`, `failed`, `completed`, or `expired`.|
| `required_action` | object or null | Details on the action required to continue the run. Will be null if no action is required.|
| `last_error` | object or null | The last error associated with this run. Will be null if there are no errors.|
| `expires_at` | integer | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run will expire.|
| `started_at` | integer or null | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was started.|
| `cancelled_at` | integer or null | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was canceled.|
| `failed_at` | integer or null | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run failed.|

Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool. |
| `max_prompt_tokens` | integer or null | The maximum number of prompt tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run. |
| `max_completion_tokens` | integer or null | The maximum number of completion tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run. |
| `usage` | object or null | Usage statistics related to the run. This value will be null if the run is not in a terminal state (for example `in_progress`, `queued`). |
| `truncation_strategy` | object | Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. | 
| `response_format` | string | The format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`. |
| `tool_choice` | string | Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model won't call any tools and instead generates a message. `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool. |

## Run step object

Represent a step in execution of a run.

| `cancelled_at`| integer or null | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run step was canceled.|
| `failed_at`| integer or null | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run step failed.|
| `completed_at`| integer or null | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run step completed.|
| `metadata`| map | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.|

## Stream a run result (preview)

Stream the result of executing a Run or resuming a Run after submitting tool outputs. You can stream events after:
* [Create Thread and Run](#create-thread-and-run) 
* [Create Run](#create-run)
* [Submit Tool Outputs](#submit-tool-outputs-to-run) 

To stream a result, pass `"stream": true` while creating a run. The response will be a [Server-Sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) stream.

### Streaming example

```python
from typing_extensions import override
from openai import AssistantEventHandler
 
# First, we create a EventHandler class to define
# how we want to handle the events in the response stream.
 
class EventHandler(AssistantEventHandler):    
  @override
  def on_text_created(self, text) -> None:
    print(f"\nassistant > ", end="", flush=True)
      
  @override
  def on_text_delta(self, delta, snapshot):
    print(delta.value, end="", flush=True)
      
  def on_tool_call_created(self, tool_call):
    print(f"\nassistant > {tool_call.type}\n", flush=True)
  
  def on_tool_call_delta(self, delta, snapshot):
    if delta.type == 'code_interpreter':
      if delta.code_interpreter.input:
        print(delta.code_interpreter.input, end="", flush=True)
      if delta.code_interpreter.outputs:
        print(f"\n\noutput >", flush=True)
        for output in delta.code_interpreter.outputs:
          if output.type == "logs":
            print(f"\n{output.logs}", flush=True)
 
# Then, we use the `create_and_stream` SDK helper 
# with the `EventHandler` class to create the Run 
# and stream the response.
 
with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  assistant_id=assistant.id,
  instructions="Please address the user as Jane Doe. The user has a premium account.",
  event_handler=EventHandler(),
) as stream:
  stream.until_done()
```

## Truncation object

Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the initial context window of the run.

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
|---  |---   |---         |
| `type` | string | The truncation strategy to use for the thread. The default is `auto`. If set to `last_messages`, the thread will be truncated to the n most recent messages in the thread. When set to `auto`, messages in the middle of the thread will be dropped to fit the context length of the model, `max_prompt_tokens`. | Yes |	
| `last_messages`	| integer | The number of most recent messages from the thread when constructing the context for the run. | No | 

## Message delta object

Represents a message delta. For example any changed fields on a message during streaming.

|Name | Type | Description |
|---  |---   |---         |
| `id` | string | The identifier of the message, which can be referenced in API endpoints. |
| `object` | string | The object type, which is always `thread.message.delta`. |
| `delta` | object | The delta containing the fields that have changed on the Message. |

## Run step delta object

Represents a run step delta. For example any changed fields on a run step during streaming.

|Name | Type | Description |
|---  |---   |---         |
| `id` | string | The identifier of the run step, which can be referenced in API endpoints. |
| `object` | string | The object type, which is always `thread.run.step.delta`. |
| `delta` | object | The delta containing the fields that have changed on the run step.

## Assistant stream events

Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run. Each event in a server-sent events stream has an event and data property:

```json
event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
```

Events are emitted whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being streamed in parts (deltas). For example, `thread.run.created` is emitted when a new run is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created` event, a `thread.message.in_progress` event, many thread.`message.delta` events, and finally a `thread.message.completed` event.
