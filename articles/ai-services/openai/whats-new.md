# What's new in Azure OpenAI Service

This article provides a summary of the latest releases and major documentation updates for Azure OpenAI.

## December 2024

### NEW data zone provisioned deployment type

Data zone provisioned deployments are available in the same Azure OpenAI resource as all other Azure OpenAI deployment types but allow you to leverage Azure global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center within the Microsoft defined data zone with the best availability for each request. Data zone provisioned deployments provide reserved model processing capacity for high and predictable throughput using Azure infrastructure within Microsoft specified data zones. Data zone provisioned deployments are supported on `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`, and `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` models.

For more information, see the [deployment types guide](https://aka.ms/aoai/docs/deployment-types).

## November 2024

### Vision Fine-tuning GA

Vision fine-tuning with GPT-4o (2024-08-06) in now Generally Available (GA).

[Vision fine-tuning](./how-to/fine-tuning.md) allows you to add images to your JSONL training data. Just as you can send one or many image inputs to chat completions, you can include those same message types within your training data. Images can be provided either as URLs or as base64 encoded images.

For fine-tuning model region availability, see the [models page](./concepts/models.md#fine-tuning-models).

### NEW AI abuse monitoring

We are introducing new forms of abuse monitoring that leverage LLMs to improve efficiency of detection of potentially abusive use of the Azure OpenAI service and to enable abuse monitoring without the need for human review of prompts and completions. Learn more, see [Abuse monitoring](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring).

Prompts and completions that are flagged through content classification and/or identified to be part of a potentially abusive pattern of use are subjected to an additional review process to help confirm the systemâ€™s analysis and inform actioning decisions. Our abuse monitoring systems have been expanded to enable review by LLM by default and by humans when necessary and appropriate. 

## October 2024

### NEW data zone standard deployment type

Data zone standard deployments are available in the same Azure OpenAI resource as all other Azure OpenAI deployment types but allow you to leverage Azure global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center within the Microsoft defined data zone with the best availability for each request. Data zone standard provides higher default quotas than our Azure geography-based deployment types.  Data zone standard deployments are supported on `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`, and `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` models.

For more information, see the [deployment types guide](https://aka.ms/aoai/docs/deployment-types).

### Global Batch GA

Azure OpenAI global batch is now generally available.

The Azure OpenAI Batch API is designed to handle large-scale and high-volume processing tasks efficiently. Process asynchronous groups of requests with separate quota, with 24-hour target turnaround, at [50% less cost than global standard](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/). With batch processing, rather than send one request at a time you send a large number of requests in a single file. Global batch requests have a separate enqueued token quota avoiding any disruption of your online workloads.  

Key use cases include:

* **Large-Scale Data Processing:** Quickly analyze extensive datasets in parallel.

* **Content Generation:** Create large volumes of text, such as product descriptions or articles.

* **Document Review and Summarization:** Automate the review and summarization of lengthy documents.

* **Customer Support Automation:** Handle numerous queries simultaneously for faster responses.

* **Data Extraction and Analysis:** Extract and analyze information from vast amounts of unstructured data.

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks:** Perform tasks like sentiment analysis or translation on large datasets.

* **Marketing and Personalization:** Generate personalized content and recommendations at scale.

### o1-preview and o1-mini models limited access

The `o1-preview` and `o1-mini` models are now available for API access and model deployment. **Registration is required, and access will be granted based on Microsoft's eligibility criteria**.

Request access: [limited access model application](https://aka.ms/oai/modelaccess)

Customers who were already approved and have access to the model through the early access playground don't need to apply again, you'll automatically be granted API access. Once access has been granted, you'll need to create a deployment for each model.

**API support:**

Support for the **o1 series** models was added in API version `2024-09-01-preview`.

The `max_tokens` parameter has been deprecated and replaced with the new `max_completion_tokens` parameter. **o1 series** models will only work with the `max_completion_tokens` parameter.

**Region availability**:

Models are available for standard and global standard deployment in East US2 and Sweden Central for approved customers.

### New GPT-4o Realtime API for speech and audio public preview

Azure OpenAI GPT-4o audio is part of the GPT-4o model family that supports low-latency, "speech in, speech out" conversational interactions. The GPT-4o audio `realtime` API is designed to handle real-time, low-latency conversational interactions, making it a great fit for use cases involving live interactions between a user and a model, such as customer support agents, voice assistants, and real-time translators.

The `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` model is available for global deployments in [East US 2 and Sweden Central regions](./concepts/models.md#global-standard-model-availability).

For more information, see the [GPT-4o real-time audio documentation](realtime-audio-quickstart.md).

### NEW Global provisioned deployment type
Global deployments are available in the same Azure OpenAI resources as non-global deployment types but allow you to leverage Azure's global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center with best availability for each request. Global provisioned deployments provide reserved model processing capacity for high and predictable throughput using Azure global infrastructure. Global provisioned deployments are supported on `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` and `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` models.

For more information, see the [deployment types guide](https://aka.ms/aoai/docs/deployment-types).

### NEW o1-preview and o1-mini models available for limited access

The Azure OpenAI `o1-preview` and `o1-mini` models are designed to tackle reasoning and problem-solving tasks with increased focus and capability. These models spend more time processing and understanding the user's request, making them exceptionally strong in areas like science, coding, and math compared to previous iterations.

### Key capabilities of the o1 series

- Complex Code Generation: Capable of generating algorithms and handling advanced coding tasks to support developers.
- Advanced Problem Solving: Ideal for comprehensive brainstorming sessions and addressing multifaceted challenges.
- Complex Document Comparison: Perfect for analyzing contracts, case files, or legal documents to identify subtle differences.

Then you can adjust your filter configuration to better serve your business needs and meet Responsible AI principles.

[Use Risks & Safety monitoring](./how-to/risks-safety-monitor.md)

### Azure OpenAI On Your Data updates

- You can now connect to an Elasticsearch vector database to be used with [Azure OpenAI On Your Data](./concepts/use-your-data.md?tabs=elasticsearch#supported-data-sources).
- You can use the [chunk size parameter](./concepts/use-your-data.md#chunk-size-preview) during data ingestion to set the maximum number of tokens of any given chunk of data in your index.

### 2024-02-01 general availability (GA) API released

This is the latest GA API release and is the replacement for the previous `2023-05-15` GA release. This release adds support for the latest Azure OpenAI GA features like Whisper, DALLE-3, fine-tuning, on your data, and more.

Features that are in preview such as Assistants, text to speech (TTS), and some of the "on your data" datasources, require a preview API version. For more information, check out our [API version lifecycle guide](./api-version-deprecation.md).

### Whisper general availability (GA)

The Whisper speech to text model is now GA for both REST and Python. Client library SDKs are currently still in public preview.

Try out Whisper by following a [quickstart](./whisper-quickstart.md).

### DALL-E 3 general availability (GA)

DALL-E 3 image generation model is now GA for both REST and Python. Client library SDKs are currently still in public preview.

Try out DALL-E 3 by following a [quickstart](./dall-e-quickstart.md).

### New regional support for DALL-E 3

You can now access DALL-E 3 with an Azure OpenAI resource in the `East US` or `AustraliaEast` Azure region, in addition to `SwedenCentral`.

### Model deprecations and retirements

We have added a page to track [model deprecations and retirements](./concepts/model-retirements.md) in Azure OpenAI Service. This page provides information about the models that are currently available, deprecated, and retired.

### 2024-03-01-preview API released

`2024-03-01-preview` has all the same functionality as `2024-02-15-preview` and adds two new parameters for embeddings:

- `encoding_format` allows you to specify the format to generate embeddings in `float`, or `base64`. The default is `float`.
- `dimensions` allows you set the number of output embeddings. This parameter is only supported with the new third generation embeddings models: `text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-3-small`. Typically larger embeddings are more expensive from a compute, memory, and storage perspective. Being able to adjust the number of dimensions allows more control over overall cost and performance. The `dimensions` parameter isn't supported in all versions of the OpenAI 1.x Python library, to take advantage of this parameter  we recommend upgrading to the latest version: `pip install openai --upgrade`.

* **Faster fine-tune deployments.** Deploy an Ada and Curie fine-tuned models in under 10 minutes.â€‹

* **Higher training limits:** 40M training tokens for Ada, Babbage, and Curie. 10M for Davinci.â€‹

* **Process for requesting modifications to the abuse & miss-use data logging & human review.** Today, the service logs request/response data for the purposes of abuse and misuse detection to ensure that these powerful models aren't abused. However, many customers have strict data privacy and security requirements that require greater control over their data. To support these use cases, we're releasing a new process for customers to modify the content filtering policies or turn off the abuse logging for low-risk use cases. This process follows the established Limited Access process within Azure AI services and [existing OpenAI customers can apply here](https://aka.ms/oai/modifiedaccess).â€‹

* **Customer managed key (CMK) encryption.** CMK provides customers greater control over managing their data in Azure OpenAI by providing their own encryption keys used for storing training data and customized models. Customer-managed keys (CMK), also known as bring your own key (BYOK), offer greater flexibility to create, rotate, disable, and revoke access controls. You can also audit the encryption keys used to protect your data. [Learn more from our encryption at rest documentation](encrypt-data-at-rest.md).

* **Lockbox support**â€‹

* **SOC-2 compliance**â€‹

* **Logging and diagnostics** through Azure Resource Health, Cost Analysis, and Metrics & Diagnostic settingsâ€‹.
