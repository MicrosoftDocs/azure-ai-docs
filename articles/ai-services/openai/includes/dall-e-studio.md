Use this guide to get started generating images with Azure OpenAI in your browser with Azure AI Foundry.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- An Azure OpenAI resource created in a supported region. See [Region availability](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).


## Go to Azure AI Foundry

Browse to [Azure AI Foundry](https://oai.azure.com/) and sign in with the credentials associated with your Azure OpenAI resource. During or after the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

From the Azure AI Foundry landing page, create or select a new project. Navigate to the **Models + endpoints** page on the left nav. Select **Deploy model** and then choose one of the DALL-E models from the list. Complete the deployment process. 

On the model's page, select **Open in playground**.

## Try out image generation

Start exploring Azure OpenAI capabilities with a no-code approach through the **Images playground**. Enter your image prompt into the text box and select **Generate**. When the AI-generated image is ready, it appears on the page.

> [!NOTE]
> The image generation APIs come with a content moderation filter. If Azure OpenAI recognizes your prompt as harmful content, it doesn't return a generated image. For more information, see [Content filtering](../concepts/content-filter.md).

In the **Images playground**, you can also view Python and cURL code samples, which are prefilled according to your settings. Select **View code** near the top of the page. You can use this code to write an application that completes the same task.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
