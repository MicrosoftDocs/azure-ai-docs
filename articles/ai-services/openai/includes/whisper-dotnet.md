## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. You can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true).
- An Azure OpenAI resource with a Whisper model deployed in a [supported region](../concepts/models.md#whisper-models). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).
- [The .NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## Set up

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an *endpoint* and a *key*.

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in the **Azure OpenAI Studio** > **Playground** > **Code View**. An example endpoint is: `https://aoai-docs.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

## Create the .NET app

1. Create a .NET app using the `dotnet new` command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new console -n OpenAIWhisper
```

1. Change into the directory of the new app:

```dotnetcli
cd OpenAIWhisper
```

1. Install the [`Azure.OpenAI`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI/) client library:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI
```

## Passwordless authentication is recommended

Passwordless authentication is more secure than the key-based alternatives and the recommended approach for connecting to Azure services. If you choose to use Passwordless authentication, you'll need to complete the following:

1. Add the [`Azure.Identity`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Identity) package.

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```

1. Assign the `Cognitive Services User` role to your user account. This can be done in the Azure portal under **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**.
1. Sign-in to Azure using Visual Studio or the Azure CLI via `az login`.

## Create the app code

1. Replace the contents of `program.cs` with the following code and update the placeholder values with your own:

> [!NOTE]
> You can get sample audio files, such as *wikipediaOcelot.wav*, from the [Azure AI Speech SDK repository at GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/sampledata/audiofiles).

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using Azure.Identity; // Required for Passwordless auth

var endpoint = new Uri("YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT");
var credentials = new AzureKeyCredential("YOUR_OPENAI_KEY");
// var credentials = new DefaultAzureCredential(); // Use for Passwordless auth
var deploymentName = "whisper"; // Default name, update with your own if necessary
var audioFilePath = "YOUR_AUDIO_FILE_PATH";

var openAIClient = new AzureOpenAIClient(endpoint, credentials);

var audioClient = openAIClient.GetAudioClient(deploymentName);

var result = await audioClient.TranscribeAudioAsync(audioFilePath);

Console.WriteLine("Transcribed text:");
foreach (var item in result.Value.Text)
{
    Console.Write(item);
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, store and access your credentials using a secure method, such as [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). For more information about credential security, see [Azure AI services security](../../security-features.md).

1. Run the application using the `dotnet run` command:

```python
dotnet run
```

If you are using the sample audio file, you should see the following text printed out in the console:

``text
The ocelot, Lepardus paradalis, is a small wild cat native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides. It weighs between 8 and 15.5 kilograms, 18 and 34 pounds, and reaches 40 to 50 centimeters 16 to 20 inches at the shoulders. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Two subspecies are recognized, L. p. paradalis and L. p. mitis. Typically active during twilight and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and territorial. It is efficient at climbing, leaping, and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals such as armadillo, opossum, and lagomorphs.
```
