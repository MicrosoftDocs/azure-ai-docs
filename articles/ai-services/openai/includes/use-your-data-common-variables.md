## Retrieve resource information

You need to retrieve the following information to authenticate your application with your Azure OpenAI resource. This quickstart assumes you've uploaded your data to an Azure blob storage account and have an Azure AI Search index created. See [Add your data using Azure AI Foundry portal](../use-your-data-quickstart.md?pivots=programming-language-studio).

#### [Microsoft Entra ID](#tab/keyless)

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your Azure OpenAI resource from the Azure portal. An example endpoint is: `https://my-resoruce.openai.azure.com`.|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | This value corresponds to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model. This value can be found under **Resource Management** > **Deployments** in the Azure portal.|
| `AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` | This value can be found in the **Overview** section when examining your Azure AI Search resource from the Azure portal. |
| `AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX` | This value corresponds to the name of the index you created to store your data. You can find it in the **Overview** section when examining your Azure AI Search resource from the Azure portal. |

#### [API key](#tab/api-key)

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your Azure OpenAI resource from the Azure portal. An example endpoint is: `https://my-resoruce.openai.azure.com`.|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | This value can be found in **Resource management** > **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your Azure OpenAI resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption. |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | This value corresponds to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model. This value can be found under **Resource Management** > **Deployments** in the Azure portal.|
| `AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` | This value can be found in the **Overview** section when examining your Azure AI Search resource from the Azure portal. |
| `AZURE_AI_SEARCH_API_KEY` | This value can be found in the **Settings** > **Keys** section when examining your Azure AI Search resource from the Azure portal. You can use either the primary admin key or secondary admin key. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption. |
| `AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX` | This value corresponds to the name of the index you created to store your data. You can find it in the **Overview** section when examining your Azure AI Search resource from the Azure portal. |
