## Global batch quota

The table shows the batch quota limit. Quota values for global batch are represented in terms of enqueued tokens. When you submit a file for batch processing the number of tokens present in the file are counted. Until the batch job reaches a terminal state, those tokens will count against your  total enqueued token limit.
