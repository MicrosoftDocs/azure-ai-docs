## Deploy your model

Once you're satisfied with the experience in Azure OpenAI studio, you can deploy a web app directly from the 
Studio by selecting the **Deploy to** button. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/use-your-data/deploy-model.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the model deployment button in Azure OpenAI Studio." lightbox="../media/use-your-data/deploy-model.png":::

This gives you the option to either deploy to a standalone web application, or a copilot in Copilot Studio (preview) if you're [using your own data](../concepts/use-your-data.md#deploy-to-a-copilot-preview-teams-app-preview-or-web-app) on the model. 

As an example, if you choose to deploy a web app:

The first time you deploy a web app, you should select **Create a new web app**. Choose a name for the app, which will 
become part of the app URL. For example, `https://<appname>.azurewebsites.net`. 

Select your subscription, resource group, location, and pricing plan for the published app. To 
update an existing app, select **Publish to an existing web app** and choose the name of your previous 
app from the dropdown menu.

If you choose to deploy a web app, see the [important considerations](../how-to/use-web-app.md#important-considerations) for using it.
