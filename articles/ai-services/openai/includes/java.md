[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/openai/azure-ai-openai) | [Artifact (Maven)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-ai-openai/1.0.0-beta.3) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/openai/azure-ai-openai/src/samples)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)

* The current version of the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* The [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/install/), or another dependency manager.
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with the `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).


## Set up

[!INCLUDE [get-key-endpoint](get-key-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [environment-variables](environment-variables.md)]


## Create a new Java application

Create a new Gradle project.

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `gradle init` command from your working directory. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, including *build.gradle.kts*, which is used at runtime to create and configure your application.

```console
gradle init --type basic
```

When prompted to choose a **DSL**, select **Kotlin**.

## Install the Java SDK

This quickstart uses the Gradle dependency manager. You can find the client library and information for other dependency managers on the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-computervision).

Locate *build.gradle.kts* and open it with your preferred IDE or text editor. Then copy in the following build configuration. This configuration defines the project as a Java application whose entry point is the class **OpenAIQuickstart**. It imports the Azure AI Vision library.

```kotlin
plugins {
    java
    application
}
application { 
    mainClass.set("GetCompletionsSample")
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation(group = "com.azure", name = "azure-ai-openai", version = "1.0.0-beta.3")
    implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.9")
}
```

## Create a sample application


1. Create a Java file.

    From your working directory, run the following command to create a project source folder:

    ```console
    mkdir -p src/main/java
    ```

    Navigate to the new folder and create a file called *GetCompletionsSample.java*. 

1. Open *GetCompletionsSample.java* in your preferred editor or IDE and paste in the following code.

    
    ```java
    package com.azure.ai.openai.usage;
    
    import com.azure.ai.openai.OpenAIClient;
    import com.azure.ai.openai.OpenAIClientBuilder;
    import com.azure.ai.openai.models.Choice;
    import com.azure.ai.openai.models.Completions;
    import com.azure.ai.openai.models.CompletionsOptions;
    import com.azure.ai.openai.models.CompletionsUsage;
    import com.azure.core.credential.AzureKeyCredential;
    
    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.List;
    
    public class GetCompletionsSample {
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String azureOpenaiKey = System.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY");;
            String endpoint = System.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT");;
            String deploymentOrModelId = "gpt-35-turbo-instruct";
    
            OpenAIClient client = new OpenAIClientBuilder()
                .endpoint(endpoint)
                .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(azureOpenaiKey))
                .buildClient();
    
            List<String> prompt = new ArrayList<>();
            prompt.add("When was Microsoft founded?");
    
            Completions completions = client.getCompletions(deploymentOrModelId, new CompletionsOptions(prompt));
    
            System.out.printf("Model ID=%s is created at %s.%n", completions.getId(), completions.getCreatedAt());
            for (Choice choice : completions.getChoices()) {
                System.out.printf("Index: %d, Text: %s.%n", choice.getIndex(), choice.getText());
            }
    
            CompletionsUsage usage = completions.getUsage();
            System.out.printf("Usage: number of prompt token is %d, "
                    + "number of completion token is %d, and number of total tokens in request and response is %d.%n",
                usage.getPromptTokens(), usage.getCompletionTokens(), usage.getTotalTokens());
        }
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.
    
1. Navigate back to the project root folder, and build the app with:

   ```console
   gradle build
   ```
   
   Then, run it with the `gradle run` command:
   
   ```console
   gradle run
   ```

## Output

```output
Model ID=cmpl-7JZRbWuEuHX8ozzG3BXC2v37q90mL is created at 1684898835.
Index: 0, Text:

Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975..
Usage: number of prompt token is 5, number of completion token is 11, and number of total tokens in request and response is 16.
```


## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
