## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true).
- An Azure OpenAI resource created in the North Central US or Sweden Central regions with the `tts-1` or `tts-1-hd` model deployed. For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an **endpoint** and a **key**.

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | The service endpoint can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

### Environment variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

[!INCLUDE [Azure key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-services/security/azure-key-vault.md)]

# [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" 
```

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" 
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
```

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
```

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

## Create a REST request and response

In a bash shell, run the following command. You need to replace `YourDeploymentName` with the deployment name you chose when you deployed the text to speech model. The deployment name isn't necessarily the same as the model name. Entering the model name results in an error unless you chose a deployment name that is identical to the underlying model name.

```bash
curl $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/deployments/YourDeploymentName/audio/speech?api-version=2024-02-15-preview \
 -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
    "model": "tts-1-hd",
    "input": "I'm excited to try text to speech.",
    "voice": "alloy"
}' --output speech.mp3
```

The format of your first line of the command with an example endpoint would appear as follows curl `https://aoai-docs.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{YourDeploymentName}/audio/speech?api-version=2024-02-15-preview \`. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.
