1. Select your deployed `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` model from the **Deployment** dropdown.

1. Optionally, you can edit contents in the **Give the model instructions and context** text box. Give the model instructions about how it should behave and any context it should reference when generating a response. You can describe the assistant's personality, tell it what it should and shouldn't answer, and tell it how to format responses.
1. Optionally, change settings such as threshold, prefix padding, and silence duration.
1. Select **Start listening** to start the session. You can speak into the microphone to start a chat.
