## Prerequisites

- Read the [When to use Azure OpenAI fine-tuning guide](../concepts/fine-tuning-considerations.md).
- An Azure subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- An Azure OpenAI resource that's located in a region that supports fine-tuning of the Azure OpenAI model. Check the [Model summary table and region availability](../concepts/models.md#fine-tuning-models) for the list of available models by region and supported functionality. For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).
- Fine-tuning access requires **Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor**.
- If you do not already have access to view quota, and deploy models in Azure AI Foundry portal you will require [additional permissions](../how-to/role-based-access-control.md).  

## Models

The following models support fine-tuning:

- `babbage-002`
- `davinci-002`
- `gpt-35-turbo` (0613)
- `gpt-35-turbo` (1106)
- `gpt-35-turbo` (0125)
- `gpt-4` (0613)**<sup>*</sup>**
- `gpt-4o` (2024-08-06)
- `gpt-4o-mini` (2024-07-18)

**<sup>*</sup>** Fine-tuning for this model is currently in public preview.

Or you can fine tune a previously fine-tuned model, formatted as base-model.ft-{jobid}.


Consult the [models page](../concepts/models.md#fine-tuning-models) to check which regions currently support fine-tuning.


## Review the workflow for Azure AI Foundry

Take a moment to review the fine-tuning workflow for using Azure AI Foundry:

1. Prepare your training and validation data.
1. Use the **Create custom model** wizard in Azure AI Foundry portal to train your custom model.
    1. [Select a base model](#select-the-base-model).
    1. [Choose your training data](#choose-your-training-data).
    1. Optionally, [choose your validation data](#choose-your-validation-data).
    1. Optionally, [configure task parameters](#configure-task-parameters) for your fine-tuning job.
    1. [Review your choices and train your new custom model](#review-your-choices-and-train-your-model).
1. Check the status of your custom fine-tuned model.
1. Deploy your custom model for use.
1. Use your custom model.
1. Optionally, analyze your custom model for performance and fit.

## Prepare your training and validation data

Your training data and validation data sets consist of input and output examples for how you would like the model to perform.

Different model types require a different format of training data.

# [chat completion models](#tab/turbo)

The training and validation data you use **must** be formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL) document. For `gpt-35-turbo` (all versions), `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o`, and `gpt-4o-mini`, the fine-tuning dataset must be formatted in the conversational format that is used by the [Chat completions](../how-to/chatgpt.md) API.

If you would like a step-by-step walk-through of fine-tuning a `gpt-4o-mini` (2024-07-18) model please refer to the [Azure OpenAI fine-tuning tutorial.](../tutorials/fine-tune.md)

### Example file format

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an Xbox customer support agent whose primary goal is to help users with issues they are experiencing with their Xbox devices. You are friendly and concise. You only provide factual answers to queries, and do not provide answers that are not related to Xbox."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is Xbox better than PlayStation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize, but I cannot provide personal opinions. My primary job is to assist you with any issues related to your Xbox device. Do you have any Xbox-related issues that need addressing?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an Xbox customer support agent whose primary goal is to help users with issues they are experiencing with their Xbox devices. You are friendly and concise. You only provide factual answers to queries, and do not provide answers that are not related to Xbox."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can I play PC games on my Xbox?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While Xbox consoles don't natively support PC games, they can play an array of Xbox games, many of which are also available on PC. Can I assist you with finding games compatible with your Xbox device?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an Xbox customer support agent whose primary goal is to help users with issues they are experiencing with their Xbox devices. You are friendly and concise. You only provide factual answers to queries, and do not provide answers that are not related to Xbox."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm having trouble connecting my Xbox to the Wi-Fi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No worries, let's go through the network settings on your Xbox. Can you please tell me what happens when you try to connect it to the Wi-Fi?"}]}
```

### Multi-turn chat file format Azure OpenAI 

Multiple turns of a conversation in a single line of your jsonl training file is also supported. To skip fine-tuning on specific assistant messages add the optional `weight` key value pair. Currently `weight` can be set to 0 or 1.  

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the capital of France?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you be more sarcastic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.", "weight": 1}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "William Shakespeare", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you be more sarcastic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?", "weight": 1}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How far is the Moon from Earth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "384,400 kilometers", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you be more sarcastic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Around 384,400 kilometers. Give or take a few, like that really matters.", "weight": 1}]}
```

### Chat completions with vision

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"}, {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/main/articles/ai-services/openai/media/how-to/generated-seattle.png"}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The image appears to be a watercolor painting of a city skyline, featuring tall buildings and a recognizable structure often associated with Seattle, like the Space Needle. The artwork uses soft colors and brushstrokes to create a somewhat abstract and artistic representation of the cityscape."}]}
```

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.

### Create your training and validation datasets

The more training examples you have, the better. Fine tuning jobs will not proceed without at least 10 training examples, but such a small number isn't enough to noticeably influence model responses. It is best practice to provide hundreds, if not thousands, of training examples to be successful.

In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind, low quality examples can negatively impact performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data, without first pruning the dataset for only the highest quality examples you could end up with a model that performs much worse than expected.

# [babbage-002/davinci-002](#tab/completionfinetuning)

The training and validation data you use **must** be formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL) document in which each line represents a single prompt-completion pair. The OpenAI command-line interface (CLI) includes [a data preparation tool](#openai-cli-data-preparation-tool) that validates, gives suggestions, and reformats your training data into a JSONL file ready for fine-tuning.

```json
{"prompt": "<prompt text>", "completion": "<ideal generated text>"}
{"prompt": "<prompt text>", "completion": "<ideal generated text>"}
{"prompt": "<prompt text>", "completion": "<ideal generated text>"}
```

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.

### Create your training and validation datasets

Designing your prompts and completions for fine-tuning is different from designing your prompts for use with any of [our GPT-3 base models](../concepts/legacy-models.md#gpt-3-models). Prompts for completion calls often use either detailed instructions or few-shot learning techniques, and consist of multiple examples. For fine-tuning, each training example should consist of a single input prompt and its desired completion output. You don't need to give detailed instructions or multiple completion examples for the same prompt.

The more training examples you have, the better. The minimum number of training examples is 10, but such a small number of examples is often not enough to noticeably influence model responses. OpenAI states it's best practice to have at least 50 high quality training examples. However, it is entirely possible to have a use case that might require 1,000's of high quality training examples to be successful.

In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind, low quality examples can negatively impact performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data, without first pruning the dataset for only the highest quality examples you could end up with a model that performs much worse than expected.

### OpenAI CLI data preparation tool

OpenAI's CLI data preparation tool was developed for the previous generation of fine-tuning models to assist with many of the data preparation steps. This tool will only work for data preparation for models that work with the completion API like `babbage-002` and `davinci-002`. The tool validates, gives suggestions, and reformats your data into a JSONL file ready for fine-tuning.

To install the OpenAI CLI, run the following Python command:

```console
pip install openai==0.28.1
```

To analyze your training data with the data preparation tool, run the following Python command. Replace the _\<LOCAL_FILE>_ argument with the full path and file name of the training data file to analyze:

```console
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f <LOCAL_FILE>
```

This tool accepts files in the following data formats, if they contain a prompt and a completion column/key:

- Comma-separated values (CSV)
- Tab-separated values (TSV)
- Microsoft Excel workbook (XLSX)
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
- JSON Lines (JSONL)

After it guides you through the process of implementing suggested changes, the tool reformats your training data and saves output into a JSONL file ready for fine-tuning.

## Use the Create custom model wizard

Azure AI Foundry provides the **Create custom model** wizard, so you can interactively create and train a fine-tuned model for your Azure resource.

1. Open Azure AI Foundry at <a href="https://oai.azure.com/" target="_blank">https://oai.azure.com/</a> and sign in with credentials that have access to your Azure OpenAI resource. During the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

1. In Azure AI Foundry portal, browse to the **Tools > Fine-tuning** pane, and select **Fine-tune model**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-create-custom-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to access the Create custom model wizard in Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-create-custom-model.png":::

The **Create custom model** wizard opens.

### Select the base model

The first step in creating a custom model is to choose a base model. The **Base model** pane lets you choose a base model to use for your custom model. Your choice influences both the performance and the cost of your model.

Select the base model from the **Base model type** dropdown, and then select **Next** to continue.

You can create a custom model from one of the following available base models:

- `babbage-002`
- `davinci-002`
- `gpt-35-turbo` (0613)
- `gpt-35-turbo` (1106)
- `gpt-35-turbo` (0125)
- `gpt-4` (0613)

- Or you can fine tune a previously fine-tuned model, formatted as base-model.ft-{jobid}.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/models.png" alt-text="Screenshot of model options with a custom fine-tuned model." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/models.png":::

For more information about our base models that can be fine-tuned, see [Models](../concepts/models.md#fine-tuning-models).

### Choose your training data

The next step is to either choose existing prepared training data or upload new prepared training data to use when customizing your model. The **Training data** pane displays any existing, previously uploaded datasets and also provides options to upload new training data.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-training-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Training data pane for the Create custom model wizard in Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-training-data.png":::

- If your training data is already uploaded to the service, select **Files from Azure OpenAI Connection**.

   - Select the file from the dropdown list shown.

- To upload new training data, use one of the following options:

   - Select **Local file** to [upload training data from a local file](#upload-training-data-from-local-file).

   - Select **Azure blob or other shared web locations** to [import training data from Azure Blob or another shared web location](#import-training-data-from-azure-blob-store).

For large data files, we recommend that you import from an Azure Blob store. Large files can become unstable when uploaded through multipart forms because the requests are atomic and can't be retried or resumed. For more information about Azure Blob Storage, see [What is Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview)?

> [!NOTE]
> Training data files must be formatted as JSONL files, encoded in UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.

#### Upload training data from local file

You can upload a new training dataset to the service from a local file by using one of the following methods:

- Drag and drop the file into the client area of the **Training data** pane, and then select **Upload file**.

- Select **Browse for a file** from the client area of the **Training data** pane, choose the file to upload from the **Open** dialog, and then select **Upload file**.

After you select and upload the training dataset, select **Next** to continue.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-training-data-local.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Training data pane for the Create custom model wizard, with local file options." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-training-data-local.png":::

#### Import training data from Azure Blob store

You can import a training dataset from Azure Blob or another shared web location by providing the name and location of the file.

1. Enter the **File name** for the file.

1. For the **File location**, provide the Azure Blob URL, the Azure Storage shared access signature (SAS), or other link to an accessible shared web location.

1. Select **Import** to import the training dataset to the service.

After you select and upload the training dataset, select **Next** to continue.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-training-data-blob.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Training data pane for the Create custom model wizard, with Azure Blob and shared web location options." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-training-data-blob.png":::

### Choose your validation data

The next step provides options to configure the model to use validation data in the training process. If you don't want to use validation data, you can choose **Next** to continue to the advanced options for the model. Otherwise, if you have a validation dataset, you can either choose existing prepared validation data or upload new prepared validation data to use when customizing your model.

The **Validation data** pane displays any existing, previously uploaded training and validation datasets and provides options by which you can upload new validation data. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-validation-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Validation data pane for the Create custom model wizard in Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-validation-data.png":::

- If your validation data is already uploaded to the service, select **Choose dataset**.

   - Select the file from the list shown in the **Validation data** pane.

- To upload new validation data, use one of the following options:

   - Select **Local file** to [upload validation data from a local file](#upload-validation-data-from-local-file).
   
   - Select **Azure blob or other shared web locations** to [import validation data from Azure Blob or another shared web location](#import-validation-data-from-azure-blob-store).

For large data files, we recommend that you import from an Azure Blob store. Large files can become unstable when uploaded through multipart forms because the requests are atomic and can't be retried or resumed.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar to training data files, validation data files must be formatted as JSONL files, encoded in UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.

#### Upload validation data from local file

You can upload a new validation dataset to the service from a local file by using one of the following methods:

- Drag and drop the file into the client area of the **Validation data** pane, and then select **Upload file**.

- Select **Browse for a file** from the client area of the **Validation data** pane, choose the file to upload from the **Open** dialog, and then select **Upload file**.

#### Import validation data from Azure Blob store

You can import a validation dataset from Azure Blob or another shared web location by providing the name and location of the file.

1. Enter the **File name** for the file.

1. For the **File location**, provide the Azure Blob URL, the Azure Storage shared access signature (SAS), or other link to an accessible shared web location.

1. Select **Import** to import the training dataset to the service.

After you select and upload the validation dataset, select **Next** to continue.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-validation-data-blob.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Validation data pane for the Create custom model wizard, with Azure Blob and shared web location options." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-validation-data-blob.png":::

### Configure task parameters

The **Create custom model** wizard shows the parameters for training your fine-tuned model on the **Task parameters** pane. The following parameters are available:


|**Name**| **Type**| **Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`batch_size` |integer | The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass. In general, we've found that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets. The default value as well as the maximum value for this property are specific to a base model. A larger batch size means that model parameters are updated less frequently, but with lower variance. |
| `learning_rate_multiplier` | number | The learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning learning rate is the original learning rate used for pre-training multiplied by this value. Larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes. We recommend experimenting with values in the range 0.02 to 0.2 to see what produces the best results. A smaller learning rate may be useful to avoid overfitting. |
|`n_epochs` | integer | The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset. |
| `seed` | integer | The seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results, but may differ in rare cases. If a seed isn't specified, one will be generated for you|

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-advanced-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Advanced options pane for the Create custom model wizard, with default options selected." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-advanced-options.png":::

Select **Default** to use the default values for the fine-tuning job, or select **Custom** to display and edit the hyperparameter values. When defaults are selected, we determine the correct value algorithmically based on your training data.

After you configure the advanced options, select **Next** to [review your choices and train your fine-tuned model](#review-your-choices-and-train-your-model).

### Review your choices and train your model

The **Review** pane of the wizard displays information about your configuration choices.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-review.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review pane for the Create custom model wizard in Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-review.png":::

If you're ready to train your model, select **Start Training job** to start the fine-tuning job and return to the **Models** pane.

## Check the status of your custom model

The **Models** pane displays information about your custom model in the **Customized models** tab. The tab includes information about the status and job ID of the fine-tune job for your custom model. When the job completes, the tab displays the file ID of the result file. You might need to select **Refresh** in order to see an updated status for the model training job.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-models-job-running.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Models pane from Azure AI Foundry, with a custom model displayed." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-models-job-running.png":::

After you start a fine-tuning job, it can take some time to complete. Your job might be queued behind other jobs on the system. Training your model can take minutes or hours depending on the model and dataset size.

Here are some of the tasks you can do on the **Models** pane:

- Check the status of the fine-tuning job for your custom model in the **Status** column of the **Customized models** tab.

- In the **Model name** column, select the model name to view more information about the custom model. You can see the status of the fine-tuning job, training results, training events, and hyperparameters used in the job.

- Select **Download training file** to download the training data you used for the model.

- Select **Download results** to download the result file attached to the fine-tuning job for your model and [analyze your custom model](#analyze-your-custom-model) for training and validation performance.

- Select **Refresh** to update the information on the page.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-model-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Models pane in Azure AI Foundry portal, with a custom model displayed." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-models-job-running.png":::

## Checkpoints

When each training epoch completes a checkpoint is generated. A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model which can both be deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, as they can provide a snapshot of your model prior to overfitting having occurred. When a fine-tuning job completes you will have the three most recent versions of the model available to deploy. 


## Safety evaluation GPT-4, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o-mini fine-tuning - public preview

[!INCLUDE [Safety evaluation](../includes/safety-evaluation.md)]

## Deploy a fine-tuned model

When the fine-tuning job succeeds, you can deploy the custom model from the **Models** pane. You must deploy your custom model to make it available for use with completion calls.

[!INCLUDE [Fine-tuning deletion](fine-tune.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Only one deployment is permitted for a custom model. An error message is displayed if you select an already-deployed custom model.

To deploy your custom model, select the custom model to deploy, and then select **Deploy model**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-models-deploy-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to deploy a custom model in Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-models-deploy-model.png":::

The **Deploy model** dialog box opens. In the dialog box, enter your **Deployment name** and then select **Create** to start the deployment of your custom model. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/fine-tuning/studio-models-deploy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Deploy Model dialog in Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../media/fine-tuning/studio-models-deploy.png":::

You can monitor the progress of your deployment on the **Deployments** pane in Azure AI Foundry portal.

### Cross region deployment

Fine-tuning supports deploying a fine-tuned model to a different region than where the model was originally fine-tuned. You can also deploy to a different subscription/region.

The only limitations are that the new region must also support fine-tuning and when deploying cross subscription the account generating the authorization token for the deployment must have access to both the source and destination subscriptions.

Cross subscription/region deployment can be accomplished via [Python](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?tabs=turbo%2Cpython-new&pivots=programming-language-python#cross-region-deployment) or [REST](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?tabs=turbo%2Cpython-new&pivots=rest-api#cross-region-deployment).

## Use a deployed custom model

After your custom model deploys, you can use it like any other deployed model. You can use the **Playgrounds** in [Azure AI Foundry](https://oai.azure.com) to experiment with your new deployment. You can continue to use the same parameters with your custom model, such as `temperature` and `max_tokens`, as you can with other deployed models. For fine-tuned `babbage-002` and `davinci-002` models you will use the Completions playground and the Completions API. For fine-tuned `gpt-35-turbo-0613` models you will use the Chat playground and the Chat completion API.

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/playground-load-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Playground pane in Azure AI Foundry portal, with sections highlighted." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/playground-load-new.png":::

## Analyze your custom model

Azure OpenAI attaches a result file named _results.csv_ to each fine-tuning job after it completes. You can use the result file to analyze the training and validation performance of your custom model. The file ID for the result file is listed for each custom model in the **Result file Id** column on the **Models** pane for Azure AI Foundry. You can use the file ID to identify and download the result file from the **Data files** pane of Azure AI Foundry.

The result file is a CSV file that contains a header row and a row for each training step performed by the fine-tuning job. The result file contains the following columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `step` | The number of the training step. A training step represents a single pass, forward and backward, on a batch of training data. |
| `train_loss` | The loss for the training batch. |
| `train_mean_token_accuracy` | The percentage of tokens in the training batch correctly predicted by the model.<br>For example, if the batch size is set to 3 and your data contains completions `[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`, this value is set to 0.83 (5 of 6) if the model predicted `[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`. |
| `valid_loss` | The loss for the validation batch. |
| `validation_mean_token_accuracy` | The percentage of tokens in the validation batch correctly predicted by the model.<br>For example, if the batch size is set to 3 and your data contains completions `[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`, this value is set to 0.83 (5 of 6) if the model predicted `[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`. |
| `full_valid_loss` | The validation loss calculated at the end of each epoch. When training goes well, loss should decrease. |
|`full_valid_mean_token_accuracy` | The valid mean token accuracy calculated at the end of each epoch. When training is going well, token accuracy should increase. |

You can also view the data in your results.csv file as plots in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the link for your trained model, and you will see three charts: loss, mean token accuracy, and token accuracy. If you provided validation data, both datasets will appear on the same plot.

Look for your loss to decrease over time, and your accuracy to increase. If you see a divergence between your training and validation data, that may indicate that you are overfitting. Try training with fewer epochs, or a smaller learning rate multiplier.

## Clean up your deployments, custom models, and training files

When you're done with your custom model, you can delete the deployment and model. You can also delete the training and validation files you uploaded to the service, if needed.

### Delete your model deployment

[!INCLUDE [Fine-tuning deletion](fine-tune.md)]

You can delete the deployment for your custom model on the **Deployments** pane in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the deployment to delete, and then select **Delete** to delete the deployment.

### Delete your custom model

You can delete a custom model on the **Models** pane in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the custom model to delete from the **Customized models** tab, and then select **Delete** to delete the custom model.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete a custom model if it has an existing deployment. You must first [delete your model deployment](#delete-your-model-deployment) before you can delete your custom model.

### Delete your training files

You can optionally delete training and validation files that you uploaded for training, and result files generated during training, on the **Management** > **Data files** pane in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the file to delete, and then select **Delete** to delete the file.

## Continuous fine-tuning

Once you have created a fine-tuned model you may wish to continue to refine the model over time through further fine-tuning. Continuous fine-tuning is the iterative process of selecting an already fine-tuned model as a base model and fine-tuning it further on new sets of training examples.

To perform fine-tuning on a model that you have previously fine-tuned you would use the same process as described in [create a customized model](#use-the-create-custom-model-wizard) but instead of specifying the name of a generic base model you would specify your already fine-tuned model. A custom fine-tuned model would look like `gpt-35-turbo-0613.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7`

We also recommend including the `suffix` parameter to make it easier to distinguish between different iterations of your fine-tuned model. `suffix` takes a string, and is set to identify the fine-tuned model. With the OpenAI Python API a string of up to 18 characters is supported that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.
