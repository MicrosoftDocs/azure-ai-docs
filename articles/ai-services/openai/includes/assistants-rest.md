## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>
- <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.8 or later version</a>
- An Azure OpenAI resource with a [compatible model in a supported region](../concepts/models.md#assistants-preview).
- We recommend reviewing the [Responsible AI transparency note](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&tabs=text) and other [Responsible AI resources](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/overview?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) to familiarize yourself with the capabilities and limitations of the Azure OpenAI Service.
- An Azure OpenAI resource with the `gpt-4 (1106-preview)` model deployed was used testing this example.


## Set up

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you'll need the following:

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `ENDPOINT`               | The service endpoint can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `API-KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|
| `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` | This value will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model. This value can be found under **Resource Management** > **Deployments** in the Azure portal or via the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

## REST API

### Create an assistant

> [!NOTE]
> With Azure OpenAI the `model` parameter requires model deployment name. If your model deployment name is different than the underlying model name then you would adjust your code to ` "model": "{your-custom-model-deployment-name}"`.

```console
curl https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/assistants?api-version=2024-05-01-preview \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instructions": "You are an AI assistant that can write code to help answer math questions.",
    "name": "Math Assist",
    "tools": [{"type": "code_interpreter"}],
    "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview"
  }'
```

### Tools

An individual assistant can access up to 128 tools including `code interpreter`, as well as any custom tools you create via [functions](../how-to/assistant-functions.md).


### Create a thread

```console
curl https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/threads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d ''

```

### Add a user question to the thread

```console
curl https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/threads/thread_abc123/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?"
    }'
```

### Run the thread

```console
curl https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/threads/thread_abc123/runs \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "assistant_id": "asst_abc123",
  }'
```

### Retrieve the status of the run

```console
curl https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/threads/thread_abc123/runs/run_abc123 \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
```

### Assistant response

```
curl https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/threads/thread_abc123/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
```


## Understanding your results

In this example we create an assistant with code interpreter enabled. When we ask the assistant a math question it translates the question into python code and executes the code in sandboxed environment in order to determine the answer to the question. The code the model creates and tests to arrive at an answer is:

```python
    from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve  
      
    # Define the variable  
    x = symbols('x')  
      
    # Define the equation  
    equation = Eq(3*x + 11, 14)  
      
    # Solve the equation  
    solution = solve(equation, x)  
    solution  
```

It is important to remember that while code interpreter gives the model the capability to respond to more complex queries by converting the questions into code and running that code iteratively in the Python sandbox until it reaches a solution, you still need to validate the response to confirm that the model correctly translated your question into a valid representation in code.

<!-- We walk through the process of creating assistants with code in much more depth in our [Azure OpenAI Assistants how-to guide](../how-to/assistant.md). -->

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
