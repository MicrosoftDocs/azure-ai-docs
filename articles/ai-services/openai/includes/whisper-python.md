## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. You can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true).
- An Azure OpenAI resource with a Whisper model deployed in a [supported region](../concepts/models.md#whisper-models). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).
- [Python 3.8 or later](https://www.python.org)
- The following Python library: os

## Set up

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an *endpoint* and a *key*.

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | The service endpoint can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

### Environment variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

[!INCLUDE [Azure key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-services/security/azure-key-vault.md)]

# [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" 
```

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" 
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
```

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
```

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

## Passwordless authentication is recommended

For passwordless authentication, you need to 

1. Use the `@azure/identity` package.
1. Assign the `Cognitive Services User` role to your user account. This can be done in the Azure portal under **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**.
1. Sign in with the Azure CLI such as `az login`.


## Create a Python environment

Install the OpenAI Python client library with:

# [OpenAI Python 1.x](#tab/python-new)

```console
pip install openai
```

# [OpenAI Python 0.28.1](#tab/python)

[!INCLUDE [Deprecation](../includes/deprecation.md)]

```console
pip install openai==0.28.1
```

---

## Create the Python app

1. Create a new Python file called *quickstart.py*. Then open it up in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Replace the contents of *quickstart.py* with the following code. Modify the code to add your deployment name:

# [OpenAI Python 1.x](#tab/python-new)

```python
    import os
    from openai import AzureOpenAI
        
    client = AzureOpenAI(
        api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
        api_version="2024-02-01",
        azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")
    )
    
    deployment_id = "YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-NAME-HERE" #This will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model."
    audio_test_file = "./wikipediaOcelot.wav"
    
    result = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        file=open(audio_test_file, "rb"),            
        model=deployment_id
    )
    
    print(result)
```

# [OpenAI Python 0.28.1](#tab/python)

```python
    import openai
    import time
    import os
    
    openai.api_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")
    openai.api_base = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")  # your endpoint should look like the following https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
    openai.api_type = "azure"
    openai.api_version = "2024-02-01"
    
    model_name = "whisper"
    deployment_id = "YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-NAME-HERE" #This will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model."
    audio_language="en"
    
    audio_test_file = "./wikipediaOcelot.wav"
    
    result = openai.Audio.transcribe(
                file=open(audio_test_file, "rb"),            
                model=model_name,
                deployment_id=deployment_id
            )
    
    print(result)
```

---

Run the application using the `python` command on your quickstart file:

```python
python quickstart.py
```

You can get sample audio files, such as *wikipediaOcelot.wav*, from the [Azure AI Speech SDK repository at GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/sampledata/audiofiles).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, store and access your credentials using a secure method, such as [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). For more information about credential security, see [Azure AI services security](../../security-features.md).

## Output

```python
{"text":"The ocelot, Lepardus paradalis, is a small wild cat native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides. It weighs between 8 and 15.5 kilograms, 18 and 34 pounds, and reaches 40 to 50 centimeters 16 to 20 inches at the shoulders. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Two subspecies are recognized, L. p. paradalis and L. p. mitis. Typically active during twilight and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and territorial. It is efficient at climbing, leaping, and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals such as armadillo, opossum, and lagomorphs."}
