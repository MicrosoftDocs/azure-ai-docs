Use this article to get started using the Azure OpenAI Python SDK to deploy and use the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model. 

[Library source code](https://github.com/openai/openai-python?azure-portal=true) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/openai?azure-portal=true) |


## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.8 or later version</a>.
- The following Python libraries: `os`
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with a GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployed. See [GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo Preview model availability](../concepts/models.md#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-model-availability) for available regions. For more information about resource creation, see the [resource deployment guide](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource).

## Set up 

Install the OpenAI Python client library with:

```console
pip install openai
```


> [!NOTE]
> This library is maintained by OpenAI. Refer to the [release history](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/releases) to track the latest updates to the library.

[!INCLUDE [get-key-endpoint](get-key-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [environment-variables](environment-variables.md)]


## Create a new Python application

Create a new Python file named _quickstart.py_. Open the new file in your preferred editor or IDE.


1. Replace the contents of _quickstart.py_ with the following code. 
    
    ```python
    from openai import AzureOpenAI
    
    api_base = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")
    api_key= os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")
    deployment_name = '<your_deployment_name>'
    api_version = '2023-12-01-preview' # this might change in the future
    
    client = AzureOpenAI(
        api_key=api_key,  
        api_version=api_version,
        base_url=f"{api_base}/openai/deployments/{deployment_name}"
    )
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=deployment_name,
        messages=[
            { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant." },
            { "role": "user", "content": [  
                { 
                    "type": "text", 
                    "text": "Describe this picture:" 
                },
                { 
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "<image URL>"
                    }
                }
            ] } 
        ],
        max_tokens=2000 
    )
    
    print(response)
    ```



1. Make the following changes:
    1. Enter the name of your GPT-4 Turbo with Vision deployment in the appropriate field.
    1. Change the value of the `"url"` field to the URL of your image.
        > [!TIP]
        > You can also use a base 64 encoded image data instead of a URL. For more information, see the [GPT-4 Turbo with Vision how-to guide](../how-to/gpt-with-vision.md#use-a-local-image).
1. Run the application with the `python` command:

    ```console
    python quickstart.py
    ```


## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
