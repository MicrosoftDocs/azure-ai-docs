## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>
- <a href="https://aka.ms/installpowershell" target="_blank">You can use either the latest version, PowerShell 7, or Windows PowerShell 5.1.</a>
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with a model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against the Azure OpenAI service, you'll need the following:

| Variable name     | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ENDPOINT`        | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can also find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`. |
| `API-KEY`         | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.                                                                                                                                  |
| `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` | This value will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model. This value can be found under **Resource Management** > **Deployments** in the Azure portal or via the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal.   |

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

### Environment variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

[!INCLUDE [Azure key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-services/security/azure-key-vault.md)]

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell-interactive
$Env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY_VALUE'
```

```powershell-interactive
$Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = 'YOUR_ENDPOINT'
```

# [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
```

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
```

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

## Create a new PowerShell script

1. Create a new PowerShell file called quickstart.ps1. Then open it up in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Replace the contents of quickstart.ps1 with the following code. Modify the code to add your key, endpoint, and deployment name:

   ```powershell-interactive
   # Azure OpenAI metadata variables
   $openai = @{
       api_key     = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
       api_base    = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT # your endpoint should look like the following https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
       api_version = '2024-02-01' # this may change in the future
       name        = 'YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-NAME-HERE' #This will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model.
   }

   # Completion text
   $prompt = 'Once upon a time...'
   
   # Header for authentication
   $headers = [ordered]@{
       'api-key' = $openai.api_key
   }

   # Adjust these values to fine-tune completions
   $body = [ordered]@{
       prompt      = $prompt
       max_tokens  = 10
       temperature = 2
       top_p       = 0.5
   } | ConvertTo-Json

   # Send a completion call to generate an answer
   $url = "$($openai.api_base)/openai/deployments/$($openai.name)/completions?api-version=$($openai.api_version)"

   $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Body $body -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json'
   return "$prompt`n$($response.choices[0].text)"
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [The PowerShell Secret Management with Azure Key Vault](/powershell/utility-modules/secretmanagement/how-to/using-azure-keyvault). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

1. Run the script using PowerShell:

   ```powershell-interactive
   ./quickstart.ps1
   ```

## Output

The output will include response text following the `Once upon a time` prompt. Azure OpenAI returned `There was a world beyond the mist...where a` in this example.

```output
Once upon a time...
 There was a world beyond the mist...where a
```

Run the code a few more times to see what other types of responses you get as the response won't always be the same.


### Understanding your results

Since our example of `Once upon a time...` provides little context, it's normal for the model to not always return expected results. You can adjust the maximum number of tokens if the response seems unexpected or truncated.

Azure OpenAI also performs content moderation on the prompt inputs and generated outputs. The prompts or responses may be filtered if harmful content is detected. For more information, see the [content filter](../concepts/content-filter.md) article.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure PowerShell](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azpowershell#clean-up-resources)
