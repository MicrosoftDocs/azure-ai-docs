## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- <a href="https://aka.ms/installpowershell" target="_blank">You can use either the latest version, PowerShell 7, or Windows PowerShell 5.1.</a>
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with a model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with either the `gpt-35-turbo` or the `gpt-4` models deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you'll need an **endpoint** and a **key**.

| Variable name | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENDPOINT`    | The service endpoint can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`. |
| `API-KEY`     | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. |

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

### Environment variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

[!INCLUDE [Azure key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-services/security/azure-key-vault.md)]

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell-interactive
$Env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY_VALUE'
$Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = 'YOUR_ENDPOINT'
```

# [Command line](#tab/command-line)

```cmd
setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
```

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

## Create a new PowerShell script

1. Create a new PowerShell file called quickstart.ps1. Then open it up in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Replace the contents of quickstart.ps1 with the following code. You need to set the `engine` variable to the deployment name you chose when you deployed the GPT-35-Turbo or GPT-4 models. Entering the model name will result in an error unless you chose a deployment name that is identical to the underlying model name.

   ```powershell-interactive
   # Azure OpenAI metadata variables
   $openai = @{
      api_key     = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
      api_base    = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT # your endpoint should look like the following https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
      api_version = '2024-02-01' # this may change in the future
      name        = 'YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-NAME-HERE' #This will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model.
   }

   # Completion text
   $messages = @()
   $messages += @{
     role = 'system'
     content = 'You are a helpful assistant.'
   }
   $messages += @{
     role = 'user'
     content = 'Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?'
   }
   $messages += @{
     role = 'assistant'
     content = 'Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI.'
   }
   $messages += @{
     role = 'user'
     content = 'Do other Azure AI services support this too?'
   }

   # Header for authentication
   $headers = [ordered]@{
      'api-key' = $openai.api_key
   }

   # Adjust these values to fine-tune completions
   $body = [ordered]@{
      messages = $messages
   } | ConvertTo-Json

   # Send a request to generate an answer
   $url = "$($openai.api_base)/openai/deployments/$($openai.name)/chat/completions?api-version=$($openai.api_version)"

   $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Body $body -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json'
   return $response
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [The PowerShell Secret Management with Azure Key Vault](/powershell/utility-modules/secretmanagement/how-to/using-azure-keyvault). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

1. Run the script using PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   ./quickstart.ps1
   ```

## Output

```powershell
# the output of the script will be a .NET object containing the response
id      : chatcmpl-7sdJJRC6fDNGnfHMdfHXvPkYFbaVc
object  : chat.completion
created : 1693255177
model   : gpt-35-turbo
choices : {@{index=0; finish_reason=stop; message=}}
usage   : @{completion_tokens=67; prompt_tokens=55; total_tokens=122}

# convert the output to JSON
./quickstart.ps1 | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3

# or to view the text returned, select the specific object property
$reponse = ./quickstart.ps1
$response.choices.message.content
```


### Understanding the message structure

The GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models are optimized to work with inputs formatted as a conversation. The `messages` variable passes an array of dictionaries with different roles in the conversation delineated by system, user, and assistant. The system message can be used to prime the model by including context or instructions on how the model should respond.

The [GPT-35-Turbo & GPT-4 how-to guide](../how-to/chatgpt.md) provides an in-depth introduction into the options for communicating with these new models.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure PowerShell](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azpowershell#clean-up-resources)
