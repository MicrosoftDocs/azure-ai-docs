# Check text against a custom term list in C#

The default global list of terms in Azure Content Moderator is sufficient for most content moderation needs. However, you might need to screen for terms that are specific to your organization.

You can use the [Content Moderator SDK for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.ContentModerator/) to create custom lists of terms to use with the Text Moderation API.

This article provides information and code samples to help you get started using 
the Content Moderator SDK for .NET to:
- Create a list.
- Add terms to a list.
- Screen terms against the terms in a list.
- Delete terms from a list.
- Delete a list.
- Edit list information.
- Refresh the index so that changes to the list are included in a new scan.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) before you begin. 

## Sign up for Content Moderator services

Before you can use Content Moderator services through the REST API or the SDK, you'll need a subscription key. Subscribe to Content Moderator service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesContentModerator) to obtain one.

## Create your Visual Studio project

1. Add a new **Console app (.NET Framework)** project to your solution.

1. Name the project **TermLists**. Select this project as the single startup project for the solution.

### Install required packages

Install the following NuGet packages for the TermLists project:

- Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.ContentModerator
- Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime
- Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime.Azure
- Newtonsoft.Json

### Update the program's using statements

Add the following `using` statements.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.ContentModerator;
using Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.ContentModerator.Models;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading;
```

### Create the Content Moderator client

Add the following code to create a Content Moderator client for your subscription. Update the `AzureEndpoint` and `CMSubscriptionKey` fields with the values of your endpoint URL and subscription key. You can find these in the **Quick start** tab of your resource in the Azure portal.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Wraps the creation and configuration of a Content Moderator client.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>This class library contains insecure code. If you adapt this 
/// code for use in production, use a secure method of storing and using
/// your Content Moderator subscription key.</remarks>
public static class Clients
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The base URL fragment for Content Moderator calls.
    /// </summary>
    private static readonly string AzureEndpoint = "YOUR ENDPOINT URL";

    /// <summary>
    /// Your Content Moderator subscription key.
    /// </summary>
    private static readonly string CMSubscriptionKey = "YOUR API KEY";

    /// <summary>
    /// Returns a new Content Moderator client for your subscription.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>The new client.</returns>
    /// <remarks>The <see cref="ContentModeratorClient"/> is disposable.
    /// When you have finished using the client,
    /// you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. </remarks>
    public static ContentModeratorClient NewClient()
    {
        // Create and initialize an instance of the Content Moderator API wrapper.
        ContentModeratorClient client = new ContentModeratorClient(new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials(CMSubscriptionKey));

        client.Endpoint = AzureEndpoint;
        return client;
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). See the Azure AI services [security](../security-features.md) article for more information.

### Add private properties

Add the following private properties to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The language of the terms in the term lists.
/// </summary>
private const string lang = "eng";

/// <summary>
/// The minimum amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait between calls
/// to the Content Moderator APIs.
/// </summary>
private const int throttleRate = 3000;

/// <summary>
/// The number of minutes to delay after updating the search index before
/// performing image match operations against the list.
/// </summary>
private const double latencyDelay = 0.5;
```

## Create a term list

You create a term list with **ContentModeratorClient.ListManagementTermLists.Create**. The first parameter to **Create** is a string that contains a MIME type, which should be "application/json". For more information, see the [API reference](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/57cf755e3f9b070c105bd2c2/operations/57cf755e3f9b070868a1f67f). The second parameter is a **Body** object that contains a name and description for the new term list.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a maximum limit of **5 term lists** with each list to **not exceed 10,000 terms**.

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Content Moderator service key has a requests-per-second (RPS)
> rate limit, and if you exceed the limit, the SDK throws an exception with a 429 error code. A free tier key has a one-RPS rate limit.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Creates a new term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <returns>The term list ID.</returns>
static string CreateTermList (ContentModeratorClient client)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Creating term list.");

    Body body = new Body("Term list name", "Term list description");
    TermList list = client.ListManagementTermLists.Create("application/json", body);
    if (false == list.Id.HasValue)
    {
        throw new Exception("TermList.Id value missing.");
    }
    else
    {
        string list_id = list.Id.Value.ToString();
        Console.WriteLine("Term list created. ID: {0}.", list_id);
        Thread.Sleep(throttleRate);
        return list_id;
    }
}
```

## Update term list name and description

You update the term list information with **ContentModeratorClient.ListManagementTermLists.Update**. The first parameter to **Update** is the term list ID. The second parameter is a MIME type, which should be "application/json". For more information, see the [API reference](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/57cf755e3f9b070c105bd2c2/operations/57cf755e3f9b070868a1f685). The third parameter is a **Body** object, which contains the new name and description.

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Update the information for the indicated term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <param name="list_id">The ID of the term list to update.</param>
/// <param name="name">The new name for the term list.</param>
/// <param name="description">The new description for the term list.</param>
static void UpdateTermList (ContentModeratorClient client, string list_id, string name = null, string description = null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Updating information for term list with ID {0}.", list_id);
    Body body = new Body(name, description);
    client.ListManagementTermLists.Update(list_id, "application/json", body);
    Thread.Sleep(throttleRate);
}
```

## Add a term to a term list

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Add a term to the indicated term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <param name="list_id">The ID of the term list to update.</param>
/// <param name="term">The term to add to the term list.</param>
static void AddTerm (ContentModeratorClient client, string list_id, string term)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Adding term \"{0}\" to term list with ID {1}.", term, list_id);
    client.ListManagementTerm.AddTerm(list_id, term, lang);
    Thread.Sleep(throttleRate);
}
```

## Get all terms in a term list

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Get all terms in the indicated term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <param name="list_id">The ID of the term list from which to get all terms.</param>
static void GetAllTerms(ContentModeratorClient client, string list_id)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Getting terms in term list with ID {0}.", list_id);
    Terms terms = client.ListManagementTerm.GetAllTerms(list_id, lang);
    TermsData data = terms.Data;
    foreach (TermsInList term in data.Terms)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(term.Term);
    }
    Thread.Sleep(throttleRate);
}
```

## Add code to refresh the search index

After you make changes to a term list, you refresh its search index for the changes to be included the next time you use the term list to screen text. This is similar to how a search engine on your desktop (if enabled) or a web search engine continually refreshes its index to include new files or pages.

You refresh a term list search index with **ContentModeratorClient.ListManagementTermLists.RefreshIndexMethod**.

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Refresh the search index for the indicated term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <param name="list_id">The ID of the term list to refresh.</param>
static void RefreshSearchIndex (ContentModeratorClient client, string list_id)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Refreshing search index for term list with ID {0}.", list_id);
    client.ListManagementTermLists.RefreshIndexMethod(list_id, lang);
    Thread.Sleep((int)(latencyDelay * 60 * 1000));
}
```

## Screen text using a term list

You screen text using a term list with **ContentModeratorClient.TextModeration.ScreenText**, which takes the following parameters.

- The language of the terms in the term list.
- A MIME type, which can be "text/html", "text/xml", "text/markdown", or "text/plain".
- The text to screen.
- A boolean value. Set this field to **true** to autocorrect the text before screening it.
- A boolean value. Set this field to **true** to detect personal data in the text.
- The term list ID.

For more information, see the [API reference](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/57cf753a3f9b070c105bd2c1/operations/57cf753a3f9b070868a1f66f).

**ScreenText** returns a **Screen** object, which has a **Terms** property that lists any terms that Content Moderator detected in the screening. Note that if Content Moderator did not detect any terms during the screening, the **Terms** property has value **null**.

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Screen the indicated text for terms in the indicated term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <param name="list_id">The ID of the term list to use to screen the text.</param>
/// <param name="text">The text to screen.</param>
static void ScreenText (ContentModeratorClient client, string list_id, string text)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Screening text: \"{0}\" using term list with ID {1}.", text, list_id);
    Screen screen = client.TextModeration.ScreenText(lang, "text/plain", text, false, false, list_id);
    if (null == screen.Terms)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("No terms from the term list were detected in the text.");
    }
    else
    {
        foreach (DetectedTerms term in screen.Terms)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Found term: \"{0}\" from list ID {1} at index {2}.", term.Term, term.ListId, term.Index));
        }
    }
    Thread.Sleep(throttleRate);
}
```

## Delete terms and lists

Deleting a term or a list is straightforward. You use the SDK to do the following tasks:

- Delete a term. (**ContentModeratorClient.ListManagementTerm.DeleteTerm**)
- Delete all the terms in a list without deleting the list. (**ContentModeratorClient.ListManagementTerm.DeleteAllTerms**)
- Delete a list and all of its contents. (**ContentModeratorClient.ListManagementTermLists.Delete**)

### Delete a term

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Delete a term from the indicated term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <param name="list_id">The ID of the term list from which to delete the term.</param>
/// <param name="term">The term to delete.</param>
static void DeleteTerm (ContentModeratorClient client, string list_id, string term)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Removed term \"{0}\" from term list with ID {1}.", term, list_id);
    client.ListManagementTerm.DeleteTerm(list_id, term, lang);
    Thread.Sleep(throttleRate);
}
```

### Delete all terms in a term list

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Delete all terms from the indicated term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <param name="list_id">The ID of the term list from which to delete all terms.</param>
static void DeleteAllTerms (ContentModeratorClient client, string list_id)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Removing all terms from term list with ID {0}.", list_id);
    client.ListManagementTerm.DeleteAllTerms(list_id, lang);
    Thread.Sleep(throttleRate);
}
```

### Delete a term list

Add the following method definition to namespace TermLists, class Program.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Delete the indicated term list.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="client">The Content Moderator client.</param>
/// <param name="list_id">The ID of the term list to delete.</param>
static void DeleteTermList (ContentModeratorClient client, string list_id)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Deleting term list with ID {0}.", list_id);
    client.ListManagementTermLists.Delete(list_id);
    Thread.Sleep(throttleRate);
}
```

## Compose the Main method

Add the **Main** method definition to namespace **TermLists**, class **Program**. Finally, close the **Program** class and the **TermLists** namespace.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    using (var client = Clients.NewClient())
    {
        string list_id = CreateTermList(client);

        UpdateTermList(client, list_id, "name", "description");
        AddTerm(client, list_id, "term1");
        AddTerm(client, list_id, "term2");

        GetAllTerms(client, list_id);

        // Always remember to refresh the search index of your list
        RefreshSearchIndex(client, list_id);

        string text = "This text contains the terms \"term1\" and \"term2\".";
        ScreenText(client, list_id, text);

        DeleteTerm(client, list_id, "term1");

        // Always remember to refresh the search index of your list
        RefreshSearchIndex(client, list_id);

        text = "This text contains the terms \"term1\" and \"term2\".";
        ScreenText(client, list_id, text);

        DeleteAllTerms(client, list_id);
        DeleteTermList(client, list_id);

        Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to close the application.");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

## Run the application to see the output

Your console output will look like the following:

```console
Creating term list.
