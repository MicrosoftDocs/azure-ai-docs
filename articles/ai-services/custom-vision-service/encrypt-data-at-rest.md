# Custom Vision encryption of data at rest

Azure AI Custom Vision automatically encrypts your data when persisting it to the cloud. That encryption helps you to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments.

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-about-encryption](../includes/cognitive-services-about-encryption.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer-managed keys are only available resources created after 11 May 2020. To use CMK with Custom Vision, you need to create a new Custom Vision resource. Once the resource is created, you can use Azure Key Vault to set up your managed identity.
