# Export a model programmatically

All of the export options available on the [Custom Vision website](https://www.customvision.ai/) are also available programmatically through the client libraries. You might want to use client libraries so you can fully automate the process of retraining and updating the model iteration you use on a local device.

This guide shows you how to export your model to an ONNX file with the Python SDK.

## Create a training client

You need to have a [CustomVisionTrainingClient](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training.customvisiontrainingclient) object to export a model iteration. Create variables for your Custom Vision training resources Azure endpoint and keys, and use them to create the client object.

```python
ENDPOINT = "PASTE_YOUR_CUSTOM_VISION_TRAINING_ENDPOINT_HERE"
training_key = "PASTE_YOUR_CUSTOM_VISION_TRAINING_KEY_HERE"

credentials = ApiKeyCredentials(in_headers={"Training-key": training_key})
trainer = CustomVisionTrainingClient(ENDPOINT, credentials)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the keys from your code when you're done, and never post them publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For more information, see the Azure AI services [security](../security-features.md) article.

## Call the export method

Call the **export_iteration** method.
* Provide the project ID, iteration ID of the model you want to export.
* The *platform* parameter specifies the platform to export to: allowed values are `CoreML`, `TensorFlow`, `DockerFile`, `ONNX`, `VAIDK`, and `OpenVino`.
* The *flavor* parameter specifies the format of the exported model: allowed values are `Linux`, `Windows`, `ONNX10`, `ONNX12`, `ARM`, `TensorFlowNormal`, and `TensorFlowLite`.
* The *raw* parameter gives you the option to retrieve the raw JSON response along with the object model response.

```python
project_id = "PASTE_YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
iteration_id = "PASTE_YOUR_ITERATION_ID"
platform = "ONNX"
flavor = "ONNX10"
export = trainer.export_iteration(project_id, iteration_id, platform, flavor, raw=False)
```

For more information, see the **[export_iteration](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training.operations.customvisiontrainingclientoperationsmixin#export-iteration-project-id--iteration-id--platform--flavor-none--custom-headers-none--raw-false----operation-config-)** method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've already exported a particular iteration, you cannot call the **export_iteration** method again. Instead, skip ahead to the **get_exports** method call to get a link to your existing exported model.

## Download the exported model

Next, you'll call the **get_exports** method to check the status of the export operation. The operation runs asynchronously, so you should poll this method until the operation completes. When it completes, you can retrieve the URI where you can download the model iteration to your device.

```python
while (export.status == "Exporting"):
    print ("Waiting 10 seconds...")
    time.sleep(10)
    exports = trainer.get_exports(project_id, iteration_id)
    # Locate the export for this iteration and check its status  
    for e in exports:
        if e.platform == export.platform and e.flavor == export.flavor:
            export = e
            break
    print("Export status is: ", export.status)
```

For more information, see the **[get_exports](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training.operations.customvisiontrainingclientoperationsmixin#get-exports-project-id--iteration-id--custom-headers-none--raw-false----operation-config-)** method.

Then, you can programmatically download the exported model to a location on your device.

```python
if export.status == "Done":
    # Success, now we can download it
    export_file = requests.get(export.download_uri)
    with open("export.zip", "wb") as file:
        file.write(export_file.content)
```
