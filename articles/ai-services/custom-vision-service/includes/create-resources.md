To use the Custom Vision service, you need to create Custom Vision training and prediction resources in Azure. In the Azure portal, use the [Create Custom Vision](https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=microsoft_azure_cognitiveservices_customvision#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesCustomVision) page to create both a training resource and a prediction resource.
