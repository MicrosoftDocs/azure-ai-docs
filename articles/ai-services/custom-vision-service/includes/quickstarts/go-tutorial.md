This guide provides instructions and sample code to help you get started using the Custom Vision client library for Go to build an image classification model. You'll create a project, add tags, train the project, and use the project's prediction endpoint URL to programmatically test it. Use this example as a template for building your own image recognition app.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to build and train a classification model _without_ writing code, see the [browser-based guidance](../../getting-started-build-a-classifier.md).

Use the Custom Vision client library for Go to:

* Create a new Custom Vision project
* Add tags to the project
* Upload and tag images
* Train the project
* Publish the current iteration
* Test the prediction endpoint

Reference documentation for [(training)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v2.1/customvision/training) and [(prediction)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.1/customvision/prediction)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. You can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).
* [Go 1.8 or later](https://go.dev/doc/install).
* Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [Custom Vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=microsoft_azure_cognitiveservices_customvision#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesCustomVision) in the Azure portal to create a training and prediction resource.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Install the Custom Vision client library

To write an image analysis app with Custom Vision for Go, you need the Custom Vision service client library. Run the following command in PowerShell:

```shell
go get -u github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/...
```

Or if you use `dep`, within your repo run:
```shell
dep ensure -add github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go
```

[!INCLUDE [python-get-images](../../includes/python-get-images.md)]


## Create the Custom Vision project

Create a new file called *sample.go* in your preferred project directory, and open it in your preferred code editor.

Add the following code to your script to create a new Custom Vision service project.

See the [CreateProject](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training.trainings.createproject#com_microsoft_azure_cognitiveservices_vision_customvision_training_Trainings_createProject_String_CreateProjectOptionalParameter_) method to specify other options when you create your project (explained in the [Build a classifier](../../getting-started-build-a-classifier.md) web portal guide).

```go
import(
    "context"
    "bytes"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "path"
    "log"
    "time"
    "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v3.0/customvision/training"
    "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v3.0/customvision/prediction"
)

var (
    training_key string = os.Getenv("VISION_TRAINING_KEY")
    prediction_key string = os.Getenv("VISION_PREDICTION_KEY")
    prediction_resource_id = os.Getenv("VISION_PREDICTION_RESOURCE_ID")
    endpoint string = os.Getenv("VISION_ENDPOINT")    

    project_name string = "Go Sample Project"
    iteration_publish_name = "classifyModel"
    sampleDataDirectory = "<path to sample images>"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Creating project...")

    ctx = context.Background()

    trainer := training.New(training_key, endpoint)

    project, err := trainer.CreateProject(ctx, project_name, "sample project", nil, string(training.Multilabel))
    if (err != nil) {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
```

## Create tags in the project

To create classification tags to your project, add the following code to the end of *sample.go*:

```go
// Make two tags in the new project
hemlockTag, _ := trainer.CreateTag(ctx, *project.ID, "Hemlock", "Hemlock tree tag", string(training.Regular))
cherryTag, _ := trainer.CreateTag(ctx, *project.ID, "Japanese Cherry", "Japanese cherry tree tag", string(training.Regular))
```

## Upload and tag images

To add the sample images to the project, insert the following code after the tag creation. This code uploads each image with its corresponding tag. You can upload up to 64 images in a single batch.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to change the path to the images based on where you downloaded the Azure AI services Go SDK Samples project earlier.

```go
fmt.Println("Adding images...")
japaneseCherryImages, err := ioutil.ReadDir(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Japanese Cherry"))
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error finding Sample images")
}

hemLockImages, err := ioutil.ReadDir(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Hemlock"))
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error finding Sample images")
}

for _, file := range hemLockImages {
    imageFile, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Hemlock", file.Name()))
    imageData := ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(imageFile))

    trainer.CreateImagesFromData(ctx, *project.ID, imageData, []string{ hemlockTag.ID.String() })
}

for _, file := range japaneseCherryImages {
    imageFile, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Japanese Cherry", file.Name()))
    imageData := ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(imageFile))
    trainer.CreateImagesFromData(ctx, *project.ID, imageData, []string{ cherryTag.ID.String() })
}
```

## Train and publish the project

This code creates the first iteration of the prediction model and then publishes that iteration to the prediction endpoint. The name given to the published iteration can be used to send prediction requests. An iteration isn't available in the prediction endpoint until it's published.

```go
fmt.Println("Training...")
iteration, _ := trainer.TrainProject(ctx, *project.ID)
for {
    if *iteration.Status != "Training" {
        break
    }
    fmt.Println("Training status: " + *iteration.Status)
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    iteration, _ = trainer.GetIteration(ctx, *project.ID, *iteration.ID)
}
fmt.Println("Training status: " + *iteration.Status)

trainer.PublishIteration(ctx, *project.ID, *iteration.ID, iteration_publish_name, prediction_resource_id))
```

## Use the prediction endpoint

To send an image to the prediction endpoint and retrieve the prediction, add the following code to the end of the file:

```go
    fmt.Println("Predicting...")
    predictor := prediction.New(prediction_key, endpoint)

    testImageData, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Test", "test_image.jpg"))
    results, _ := predictor.ClassifyImage(ctx, *project.ID, iteration_publish_name, ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(testImageData)), "")

    for _, prediction := range *results.Predictions    {
        fmt.Printf("\t%s: %.2f%%", *prediction.TagName, *prediction.Probability * 100)
        fmt.Println("")
    }
}
```

## Run the application

Run the application by using the following command:

```shell
go run sample.go
```

The output of the application should be similar to the following text:

```console
Creating project...
Adding images...
Training...
Training status: Training
Training status: Training
Training status: Training
Training status: Completed
Done!
        Hemlock: 93.53%
        Japanese Cherry: 0.01%
```

You can then verify that the test image (found in *<base_image_url>/Images/Test/*) is tagged appropriately. You can also go back to the [Custom Vision website](https://customvision.ai) and see the current state of your newly created project.

Now you've seen how every step of the object detection process can be done in code. This sample executes a single training iteration, but often you'll need to train and test your model multiple times in order to make it more accurate.
