> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft is announcing the planned retirement of the Azure Custom Vision service. Microsoft will provide full support for all existing Azure Custom Vision customers until 9/25/2028. During this support window, customers are encouraged to begin planning and executing their transition to alternative solutions.
> Depending on your use case, we recommend the following paths for transition:
> - For creating custom models for both image classification and object detection, **Azure Machine Learning AutoML** offers the ability to train both custom model types using classic machine learning techniques
> - [Learn more about Azure Machine Learning AutoML](/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml?view=azureml-api-2) and explore how it can offer support for custom model training.
> 
> Microsoft is also investing in Generative AI-based solutions that increase accuracy in custom scenarios using prompt engineering and other techniques.
> - To use generative models, you can use one of models available in the Azure AI Foundry model catalog and create your own solution for customized vision.
> - For a managed generative solution for image classification, Azure AI Content Understanding (currently in public preview) offers the ability to create custom classification workflows. It also supports processing unstructured data of any type (image, documents, audio, video) and extract structured insights based on pre-defined or user-defined formats.
> - [Learn more about Azure AI Foundry Models](/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/foundry-models-overview) and [Azure AI Content Understanding (public preview)](/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/overview) and explore how they can offer alternative paths for your custom needs.
