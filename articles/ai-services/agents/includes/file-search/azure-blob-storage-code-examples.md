## Quickstart – Use existing files in Azure Blob Storage with file search
In this example, we use Azure AI Agent Service to create an agent that can help answer questions on information from files in Azure Blob Storage.

###  Prerequisites 
1. Complete the [standard agent setup](../../quickstart.md).

2. Ensure that you have the role  **Storage Blob Data Contributor** on your project's storage account.

3. Ensure that you have the role **Azure AI Developer** on your project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> File search using Blob storage is only supported by the standard agent setup.

### Step 1: Create a project client
```python
import os
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.ai.projects.models import FileSearchTool, VectorStoreDataSource, VectorStoreDataSourceAssetType
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential


# Create an Azure AI Client from a connection string, copied from your Azure AI Foundry project.
# At the moment, it should be in the format "<HostName>;<AzureSubscriptionId>;<ResourceGroup>;<ProjectName>"
# Customer needs to login to Azure subscription via Azure CLI and set the environment variables

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
project_client = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(
    credential=credential, conn_str=os.environ["PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING"]
)
```

### Step 2: Upload local files to your project Azure Blob Storage container
Upload your local file to the project’s Azure Blob Storage container. This is the same storage account you connected to your agent during setup. When creating additional agents within the same project, you can reuse the asset URIs of any previously uploaded files that those agents need. This means you don't have to upload the same file repeatedly, as the asset URIs allow you to reference the files directly.

Then, create a vector store using the ```asset_uri```, which is the location of your file in your project's datastore.
```python
# We'll upload the local file to your project Azure Blob Storage container and will use it for vector store creation.
_, asset_uri = project_client.upload_file("sample_file_for_upload.md")
print(f"Uploaded file, asset URI: {asset_uri}")

# create a vector store with a file in blob storage and wait for it to be processed
ds = VectorStoreDataSource(asset_identifier=asset_uri, asset_type=VectorStoreDataSourceAssetType.URI_ASSET)
vector_store = project_client.agents.create_vector_store_and_poll(data_sources=[ds], name="sample_vector_store")
print(f"Created vector store, vector store ID: {vector_store.id}")
```

### Step 3: Create an agent with access to the file search tool

```python
# create a file search tool
file_search_tool = FileSearchTool(vector_store_ids=[vector_store.id])

# notices that FileSearchTool as tool and tool_resources must be added or the assistant unable to search the file
agent_1 = project_client.agents.create_agent(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    name="my-assistant",
    instructions="You are helpful assistant",
    tools=file_search_tool.definitions,
    tool_resources=file_search_tool.resources,
)
# [END upload_file_and_create_agent_with_file_search]
print(f"Created agent_1, agent_1 ID: {agent_1.id}")

thread = project_client.agents.create_thread()
print(f"Created thread, thread ID: {thread.id}")

message = project_client.agents.create_message(
    thread_id=thread.id, role="user", content="What feature does Smart Eyewear offer?"
)
print(f"Created message, message ID: {message.id}")

run = project_client.agents.create_and_process_run(thread_id=thread.id, agent_id=agent_1.id)

project_client.agents.delete_vector_store(vector_store.id)
print("Deleted vector store")

project_client.agents.delete_agent(agent.id)
print("Deleted agent")

messages = project_client.agents.list_messages(thread_id=thread.id)
print(f"Messages: {messages}")
```

### Step 4: Create second vector store using the previously uploaded file
Now, create a second vector store using the previously uploaded file. Using the ```asset_uri``` of a file already in Azure Blob Storage is useful if you have multiple agents that need access to the same files, as it eliminates the need to upload the same file multiple times.
```python

# create a vector store with a previously uploaded file and wait for it to be processed
ds_2 = VectorStoreDataSource(asset_identifier=asset_uri, asset_type=VectorStoreDataSourceAssetType.URI_ASSET)
vector_store_2 = project_client.agents.create_vector_store_and_poll(data_sources=[ds_2], name="sample_vector_store_2")
print(f"Created vector store, vector store ID: {vector_store.id}")

```

### Step 5: Create a second agent with access to the file search tool
```python
file_search_tool_2 = FileSearchTool(vector_store_ids=[vector_store_2.id])
# notices that FileSearchTool as tool and tool_resources must be added or the assistant unable to search the file
agent_2 = project_client.agents.create_agent(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    name="my-assistant-2",
    instructions="You are helpful assistant",
    tools=file_search_tool_2.definitions,
    tool_resources=file_search_tool_2.resources,
)
# [END upload_file_and_create_agent_with_file_search]
print(f"Created agent, agent ID: {agent_2.id}")
```
