# Use Docker Compose to deploy multiple containers

This article shows you how to deploy multiple Azure AI containers. Specifically, you'll learn how to use Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple Docker container images.

> [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. In Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, you create and start all the services from your configuration by running a single command.

It can be useful to orchestrate multiple container images on a single host computer. In this article, we'll pull together the Read and Document Intelligence containers.

## Prerequisites

This procedure requires several tools that must be installed and run locally:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services) before you begin.
* [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine). Confirm that the Docker CLI works in a console window.
* An Azure resource with the correct pricing tier. Only the following pricing tiers work with this container:
  * **Azure AI Vision** resource with F0 or Standard pricing tier only.
  * **Document Intelligence** resource with F0 or Standard pricing tier only.
  * **Azure AI services** resource with the S0 pricing tier.
* If you're using a gated preview container, You will need to complete the [online request form](https://aka.ms/csgate/) to use it.

## Docker Compose file

The YAML file defines all the services to be deployed. These services rely on either a `DockerFile` or an existing container image. In this case, we'll use two preview images. Copy and paste the following YAML file, and save it as *docker-compose.yaml*. Provide the appropriate **apikey**, **billing**, and **EndpointUri** values in the file.

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  forms:
    image: "mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/form-recognizer/layout"
    environment:
       eula: accept
       billing: # < Your Document Intelligence billing URL >
       apikey: # < Your Document Intelligence API key >
       FormRecognizer__ComputerVisionApiKey: # < Your Document Intelligence API key >
       FormRecognizer__ComputerVisionEndpointUri: # < Your Document Intelligence URI >
    volumes:
       - type: bind
         source: E:\publicpreview\output
         target: /output
       - type: bind
         source: E:\publicpreview\input
         target: /input
    ports:
      - "5010:5000"

  ocr:
    image: "mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/vision/read:3.1-preview"
    environment:
      eula: accept
      apikey: # < Your Azure AI Vision API key >
      billing: # < Your Azure AI Vision billing URL >
    ports:
      - "5021:5000"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Create the directories on the host machine that are specified under the **volumes** node. This approach is required because the directories must exist before you try to mount an image by using volume bindings.

## Start the configured Docker Compose services

A Docker Compose file enables the management of all the stages in a defined service's life cycle: starting, stopping, and rebuilding services; viewing the service status; and log streaming. Open a command-line interface from the project directory (where the docker-compose.yaml file is located).

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid errors, make sure that the host machine correctly shares drives with Docker Engine. For example, if *E:\publicpreview* is used as a directory in the *docker-compose.yaml* file, share drive **E** with Docker.

From the command-line interface, execute the following command to start (or restart) all the services defined in the *docker-compose.yaml* file:

```console
docker-compose up
```

The first time Docker executes the **docker-compose up** command by using this configuration, it pulls the images configured under the **services** node and then downloads and mounts them:

## Verify the service availability

[!INCLUDE [Tip for using docker list](../includes/cognitive-services-containers-docker-list-tip.md)]

Here's some example output:

```

```

### Test containers

Open a browser on the host machine and go to **localhost** by using the specified port from the *docker-compose.yaml* file, such as http://localhost:5021/swagger/index.html. For example, you could use the **Try It** feature in the API to test the Document Intelligence endpoint. Both containers swagger pages should be available and testable.
