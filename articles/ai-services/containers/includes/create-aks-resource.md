## Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster resource

1. Go to [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://portal.azure.com/#create/microsoft.aks), and select **Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following information:

    |Setting|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Subscription|Select an appropriate subscription.|
    |Resource group|Select an available resource group.|
    |Kubernetes cluster name|Enter a name (lowercase).|
    |Region|Select a nearby location.|
    |Kubernetes version|Whatever value is marked as **(default)**.|
    |DNS name prefix|Created automatically, but you can override.|
    |Node size|Standard DS2 v2:<br>`2 vCPUs`, `7 GB`|
    |Node count|Leave the slider at the default value.|

1. On the **Node pools** tab, leave **Virtual nodes** and **VM scale sets** set to their default values.
1. On the **Authentication** tab, leave **Service principal** and **Enable RBAC** set to their default values.
1. On the **Networking** tab, enter the following selections:

    |Setting|Value|
    |--|--|
    |HTTP application routing|No|
    |Networking configuration|Basic|

1. On the **Integrations** tab, make sure that **Container monitoring** is set to **Enabled**, and leave **Log Analytics workspace** as the default value.
1. On the **Tags** tab, leave the name/value pairs blank for now.
1. Select **Review and Create**.
1. After validation passes, select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> If validation fails, it might be because of a "Service principal" error. Go back to the **Authentication** tab and then go back to **Review + create**, where validation should run and then pass.
