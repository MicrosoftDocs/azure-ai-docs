# Limited Access features for Azure AI services

Our vision is to empower developers and organizations to use AI to transform society in positive ways. We encourage responsible AI practices to protect the rights and safety of individuals. To help achieve this goal, Microsoft has implemented a Limited Access policy grounded in our [AI Principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai) to support responsible deployment of Azure services.

## What is Limited Access?

Limited Access services require registration, and only customers managed by Microsoft&mdash;meaning anyone who works directly with Microsoft account teams&mdash;is eligible for access. The use of these services is limited to the use case selected at the time of registration. Customers must acknowledge that they've reviewed and agree to the terms of service. Microsoft might require customers to reverify this information.

Limited Access services are made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services (including the [terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-supplemental-terms-and-conditions)). Review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations governing your use of Limited Access services.

### How long does the registration process take?

You'll receive communication from us about your application within 5-10 business days. In some cases, reviews can take longer. You'll receive an email as soon as your application is reviewed.

### Who is eligible to use Limited Access services?

Limited Access services are available only to customers managed by Microsoft. Additionally, Limited Access services are only available for certain use cases, and customers must select their intended use case in their registration form.  

Please use an email address affiliated with your organization in your registration form. Registration forms submitted with personal email addresses are denied.

If you're not a managed customer, we invite you to submit an application using the same forms and we'll reach out to you about any opportunities to join an eligibility program. 

### What is a managed customer? What if I don't know whether I'm a managed customer?

Managed customers work with Microsoft account teams. We invite you to submit a registration form for the features you'd like to use, and we'll verify your eligibility for access. We aren't able to accept requests to become a managed customer at this time.

### What happens if I'm an existing customer and I don't register?

Existing customers have until June 30, 2023 to submit a registration form and be approved to continue using Limited Access services after June 30, 2023. Allow 10 business days for review. Without an approved application, you will be denied access after June 30, 2023.  

### I'm an existing customer who applied for access to Custom Neural Voice or Speaker Recognition. Do I have to register to keep using these services?

We're always looking for opportunities to improve our Responsible AI program, and Limited Access is an update to our service gating processes. If you previously applied for and were granted access to Custom Neural Voice or Speaker Recognition, we request that you submit a new registration form to continue using these services beyond June 30, 2023. 

If you're an existing customer using Custom Neural Voice or Speaker Recognition on June 21, 2022, you have until June 30, 2023 to submit a registration form with your selected use case and receive approval to continue using these services after June 30, 2023. We recommend allowing 10 days for application processing. Existing customers can continue using the service until June 30, 2023, after which they must be approved for access. The registration forms can be found here: 

- [Custom Neural Voice](https://aka.ms/customneural): Pro features 
- [Speaker Recognition](https://aka.ms/azure-speaker-recognition): All features 

### What if my use case isn't on the registration form?

Limited Access features are only available for the use cases listed on the registration forms. If your desired use case isn't listed, let us know in this [feedback form](https://aka.ms/CogSvcsLimitedAccessFeedback) so we can improve our service offerings. 

### Where can I use Limited Access services?

To view regional availability for a Limited Access service, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/). In the Brazil South and UAE North datacenter regions, we prioritize access for commercial customers managed by Microsoft.

For more information about supported regions for Custom Neural Voice and Speaker Recognition operations, see [Speech service supported regions](./speech-service/regions.md).

### What happens to my data if my application is denied?

If you're an existing customer and your application for access is denied, you can no longer use Limited Access features after June 30, 2023. Your data is subject to Microsoft's [data retention policies](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-management#leave).
