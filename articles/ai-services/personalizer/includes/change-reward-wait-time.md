### Change the reward wait time

In the Azure portal, go to your Personalizer resource's **Configuration** page, and change the **Reward wait time** to 10 minutes. This determines how long the model will wait after sending a recommendation, to receive the reward feedback from that recommendation. Training won't occur until the reward wait time has passed.
