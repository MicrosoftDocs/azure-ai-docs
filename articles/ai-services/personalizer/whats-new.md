[Learn more about Inference Explainability](how-to-inference-explainability.md).
* Personalizer SDK now available in [Java](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-ai-personalizer/1.0.0-beta.1/jar) and [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure-rest/ai-personalizer).

### April 2022
* Local inference SDK (Preview): Personalizer now supports near-realtime (sub-10ms) inference without the need to wait for network API calls. Your Personalizer models can be used locally for lightning fast Rank calls using the [C# SDK (Preview)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.Personalizer/2.0.0-beta.2), empowering your applications to personalize quickly and efficiently. Your model continues to train in Azure while your local model is seamlessly updated. 

### May 2021  - //Build conference

* Auto-Optimize (Preview) : You can configure a Personalizer loop that you are using to continuously improve over time with less work. Personalizer will automatically run offline evaluations, discover better machine learning settings, and apply them. To learn more, see [Personalizer Auto-Optimize (Preview)](concept-auto-optimization.md).
* Multi-slot personalization (Preview): If you have tiled layouts, carousels, and/or sidebars, it is easier to use Personalizer for each place that you recommend products or content on the same page.
