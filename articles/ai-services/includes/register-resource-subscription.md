> [!Tip]
> If your subscription doesn't allow you to create an Azure AI services resource, you might need to enable the privilege of that [Azure resource provider](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#register-resource-provider) using the [Azure portal](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-portal), [PowerShell command](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-powershell) or an [Azure CLI command](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-cli). If you are not the subscription owner, ask the *Subscription Owner* or someone with a role of *admin* to complete the registration for you or ask for the **/register/action** privileges to be granted to your account.
