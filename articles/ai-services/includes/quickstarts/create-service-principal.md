## Create an Azure Service Principal

To have your application interact with your Azure account, you need an Azure service principal to manage permissions. Follow the instructions in [Create an Azure service principal](/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps).

When you create a service principal, you'll see it has a secret value, an ID, and an application ID. Save the application ID and secret to a temporary location for later steps.
