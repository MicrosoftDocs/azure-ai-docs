## Prerequisites

* A valid Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).

## Create a new Azure AI services resource

The Azure AI services multi-service resource is listed under **Azure AI services** > **Azure AI services** in the portal. Look for the logo as shown here:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure provides more than one resource kinds named Azure AI services. Be sure to select the one that is listed under **Azure AI services** > **Azure AI services** with the logo as shown previously.

To create an Azure AI services resource follow these instructions:
1. Select this link to create an **Azure AI services** resource: [https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAIServices](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAIServices)

1. On the **Create** page, provide the following information:

    |Project details| Description   |
    |--|--|
    | **Subscription** | Select one of your available Azure subscriptions. |
    | **Resource group** | The Azure resource group that will contain your Azure AI services resource. You can create a new group or add it to a pre-existing group. |
    | **Region** | The location of your Azure AI service instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. |
    | **Name** | A descriptive name for your Azure AI services resource. For example, *MyAIServicesResource*. |
    | **Pricing tier** | The cost of your Azure AI services account depends on the options you choose and your usage. For more information, see the API [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/). |

1. Configure other settings for your resource as needed, read and accept the conditions (as applicable), and then select **Review + create**.

> [!TIP]
> If your subscription doesn't allow you to create an Azure AI services resource, you might need to enable the privilege of that [Azure resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) using the [Azure portal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-portal), [PowerShell command](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-powershell) or an [Azure CLI command](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-cli). If you are not the subscription owner, ask someone with the role of *Owner* or *Admin* to complete the registration for you or ask for the **/register/action** privileges to be granted to your account.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources contained in the group.

1. In the Azure portal, expand the menu on the left side to open the menu of services, and choose **Resource Groups** to display the list of your resource groups.
1. Locate the resource group containing the resource to be deleted.
1. If you want to delete the entire resource group, select the resource group name. On the next page, Select **Delete resource group**, and confirm.
1. If you want to delete only the Azure AI services resource, select the resource group to see all the resources within it. On the next page, select the resource that you want to delete, select the ellipsis menu for that row, and select **Delete**.
