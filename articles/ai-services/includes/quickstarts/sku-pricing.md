Pricing tiers (and the amount you're billed) are based on the number of transactions that you send by using your authentication information. Each pricing tier specifies the:

* Maximum number of allowed transactions per second (TPS).
* Service features enabled within the pricing tier.
* Cost for a predefined number of transactions. Going above this number will cause an extra charge, as specified in the [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) for your service.
