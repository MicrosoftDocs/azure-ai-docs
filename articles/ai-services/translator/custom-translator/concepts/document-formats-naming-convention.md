# Azure AI Custom Translator formats and naming convention guidance

Any file used for custom translation must be at least **four** characters in length.

This table includes all supported file formats that you can use to build your translation system:

| Format            | Extensions   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `XLIFF`             | `.XLF`, `.XLIFF` | A parallel document format, export of Translation Memory systems. The languages used are defined inside the file.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `TMX`               | `.TMX`         | A parallel document format, export of Translation Memory systems. The languages used are defined inside the file.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `ZIP`               | `.ZIP`         | An archive file format.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Locstudio`         | `.LCL`         | A Microsoft format for parallel documents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Microsoft Word    | `.DOCX`        | Microsoft Word document                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The file name must not contain Japanese characters.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Aligned text file | `.ALIGN`       | The extension `.ALIGN` is a special extension that you can use if you know that the sentences in the document pair are perfectly aligned. If you provide a `.ALIGN` file, Custom Translator doesn't align the sentences for you. |
| Excel file        | `.XLSX`        | Excel file (2013 or later). First line/ row of the spreadsheet should be language code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Dictionary formats

For dictionaries, Custom Translator supports all file formats that are supported for training sets. If you're using an Excel dictionary, the first line/ row of the spreadsheet should be language codes.

## ZIP file formats

Documents can be grouped into a single zip file and uploaded. The Custom Translator supports zip file formats (`ZIP`, `GZ`, and `TGZ`).

Each document in the zip file with the extension TXT, HTML, HTM, PDF, DOCX, ALIGN must follow this naming convention:

{document name}\_{language code}
where {document name} is the name of your document, {language code} is the ISO LanguageID (two characters), indicating that the document contains sentences in that language. There must be an underscore (_) before the language code.

For example, to upload two parallel documents within a zip for an English to
Spanish system, the files should be named `data_en` and `data_es`.

Translation Memory files (`TMX`, `XLF`, `XLIFF`, `LCL`, `XLSX`) aren't required to follow the specific language-naming convention.
