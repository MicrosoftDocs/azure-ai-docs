# Train an Azure AI Custom Translator model

An Azure AI Custom Translator model provides translations for a specific language pair. The outcome of a successful training is a model. To train a custom model, three mutually exclusive document types are required: training, tuning, and testing. If only training data is provided when queuing a training, Custom Translator automatically assembles tuning and testing data. It uses a random subset of sentences from your training documents, and exclude these sentences from the training data itself. A minimum of 10,000 parallel training sentences are required to train a full model.

## Create custom model

1. Select the **Train model** blade.

1. Type the **Model name**.

1. Keep the default **Full training** selected or select **Dictionary-only training**.

   >[!Note]
   >Full training displays all uploaded document types. Dictionary-only displays dictionary documents only.

1. Under **Select documents**, select the documents you want to use to train the model, for example, `sample-English-German` and review the training cost associated with the selected number of sentences.

1. Select **Train now**.

1. Select **Train** to confirm.

    >[!Note]
    >**Notifications** displays model training in progress, e.g., **Submitting data** state. Training model takes few hours, subject to the number of selected sentences.

## When to select dictionary-only training

For better results, we recommended letting the system learn from your training data. However, when you don't have enough parallel sentences to meet the 10,000 minimum requirements, or sentences and compound nouns must be rendered as-is, use dictionary-only training. Your model typically completes training faster than with full training. The resulting models use the baseline models for translation along with the dictionaries you added. You don't see `BLEU` scores or get a test report.

> [!Note] 
>Custom Translator doesn't sentence-align dictionary files. Therefore, it is important that there are an equal number of source and target phrases/sentences in your dictionary documents and that they are precisely aligned. If not, the document upload will fail.

## Model details

1. After successful model training, select the **Model details** blade.

1. Select the **Model Name** to review training date/time, total training time, number of sentences used for training, tuning, testing, dictionary, and whether the system generated the test and tuning sets. You use `Category ID` to make translation requests.

1. Evaluate the model [`BLEU` score](../beginners-guide.md#what-is-a-bleu-score). Review the test set: the **BLEU score** is the custom model score and the **Baseline BLEU** is the pretrained baseline model used for customization. A higher **BLEU score** means higher translation quality using the custom model.

## Duplicate model

1. Select the **Model details** blade.

1. Hover over the model name and check the selection button.

1. Select **Duplicate**.

1. Fill in **New model name**.

1. Keep **Train immediately** checked if no further data is selected or uploaded, otherwise, check **Save as draft**

1. Select **Save**

   > [!Note]
   >
   > If you save the model as `Draft`, **Model details** is updated with the model name in `Draft` status.
   >
   > To add more documents, select on the model name and follow the steps in the [Create model](#create-custom-model) section.
