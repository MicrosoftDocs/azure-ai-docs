# Deploy an Azure AI Foundry custom translation model

Deploying your Azure AI Foundry custom translation model makes it available for use with the Azure AI Translator API. A language pair might have one or many successfully trained models. You can only deploy one model per language pair; however, you can deploy  a model to one or multiple regions depending on your needs. For more information, see [Translator pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/translator/#pricing).

## Deploy your trained model

You can deploy one model per language pair to one or multiple regions.

1. Select **Deploy model** from the menu on the left.

1. Select the model name under **Name** and check the button then select **Deploy model**.

1. Check the desired regions. Later, you can add or remove regions by selecting **Update regions**.

1. Select **Deploy model**. The status should transition from _Updating_deployment_ to _Deployed_region_names_.

## Replace a deployed model

To replace a deployed model, you can exchange the deployed model with a different model in the same region:

1. Select the model name under **Name** then select **Deploy model**.

1. Select **Swap model**.

   The redeployment takes several minutes to complete. In the meantime, deployed model continues to be available for use with the Translator API until this process is complete.
