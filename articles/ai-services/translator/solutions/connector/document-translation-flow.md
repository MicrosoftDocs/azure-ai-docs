# Create an Azure AI Translator Document Translation flow (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Microsoft Azure Translator connector is currently available in public preview. Features, approaches, and processes may change, before General Availability (GA) release, based on user feedback.

This tutorial guides you through configuring a Microsoft Azure Translator V3 connector cloud flow that supports document translation. The Translator V3 connector creates a connection between your Translator Service instance and Microsoft Power Automate enabling you to use one or more prebuilt operations as steps in your apps and workflows.

Document Translation is a cloud-based REST API feature of the Azure AI Translator service. The Document Translation API enables multiple and complex document translations while preserving original document structure and data format.

In this tutorial:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * [Create a blob storage account with containers for your source and target files](#azure-storage).
> * [Set-up a managed identity with role-based access control (RBAC)](#create-a-managed-identity).
> * [Translate documents from your Azure Blob Storage account](#translate-documents).
> * [Translate documents from your SharePoint site](#translate-documents).

## Prerequisites

Here's what you need to get started: [**Translator resource**](#translator-resource), [**Azure storage account**](#azure-storage) with at least two containers, and a [**system-assigned managed identity**](#managed-identity-with-rbac) with role-based access.

### Translator resource

* If you don't have an active [**Azure account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/), you can [**create one for free**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* Create a [**single-service Translator resource**](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextTranslation) (**not** a multi-service Azure AI services resource). As you complete the Translator project and instance details fields, pay special attention to the following entries:

  * **Resource Region**. Choose  a **geographic** region like **West US** (**not** the *Global* region).

  * **Pricing tier**. Select **Standard S1** to try the service.

* Use the **key** and **name** from your Translator resource to connect your application to Power Automate. Your Translator resource keys are found under the Resource Management section in the Azure portal and your resource name is located at the top of the page.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/connectors/keys-resource-details.png" alt-text="Get key and endpoint.":::

* Copy and paste your key and resource name in a convenient location, such as *Microsoft Notepad*.

### Azure storage

* Next, you need an [**Azure Blob Storage account**](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StorageAccount-ARM) and at least two [containers](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal?branch=main#create-a-container) for your source and target files:

  * **Source container**. This container is where you upload your files for translation (required).
  * **Target container**. This container is where your translated files are stored (required).

* **If your storage account is behind a firewall, you must enable additional configurations**:

   1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in to your Azure account.
   1. Select your Storage account.
   1. In the **Security + networking** group in the left pane, select **Networking**.
   1. In the **Firewalls and virtual networks** tab, select **Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**.

      :::image type="content" source="../../media/managed-identities/firewalls-and-virtual-networks.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Selected networks radio button selected.":::

   1. Deselect all check boxes.
   1. Make sure **Microsoft network routing** is selected.
   1. Under the **Resource instances** section, select **Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts** as the resource type and select your Translator resource as the instance name.
   1. Make certain that the **`Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account`** box is checked. For more information about managing exceptions, *see* [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security).

      :::image type="content" source="../../media/managed-identities/allow-trusted-services-checkbox-portal-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot: allow trusted services checkbox, portal view.":::

   1. Select **Save**. It may take up to 5 min for the network changes to propagate.

### Managed identity with RBAC

 Finally, before you can use the Translator V3 connector's operations for document translation, you must grant your Translator resource access to your storage account using a managed identity with role based identity control (RBAC).

  :::image type="content" source="../../document-translation/media/managed-identity-rbac-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of managed identity flow (RBAC).":::

#### Create a managed identity

First, create a system-assigned managed identity for your Translator resource and grant that identity specific permissions to access your Azure storage account:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in to your Azure account.
1. Select the Translator resource.
1. In the **Resource Management** group in the left pane, select **Identity**.
1. Within the **System assigned** tab, turn on the **Status** toggle.
1. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/managed-identities/resource-management-identity-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot: resource management identity tab in the Azure portal.":::

#### Role assignment

Next, assign a **`Storage Blob Data Contributor`** role to the managed identity *at the* storage scope for your storage resource.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in to your Azure account.
1. Select the Translator resource.
1. In the **Resource Management** group in the left pane, select **Identity**.
1. Under **Permissions** select **Azure role assignments**:

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/managed-identities/enable-system-assigned-managed-identity-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot: enable system-assigned managed identity in Azure portal.":::

1. On the Azure role assignments page that opened, choose your subscription from the drop-down menu then select **&plus; Add role assignment**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/managed-identities/azure-role-assignments-page-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Azure role assignments page in the Azure portal.":::

1. Finally, assign a **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role to your Translator service resource. The **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role gives Translator (represented by the system-assigned managed identity) read, write, and delete access to the blob container and data. In the **`Add role assignment`** pop-up window, complete the fields as follows and select **Save**:

    | Field | Value|
    |------|--------|
    |**Scope**| ***Storage***.|
    |**Subscription**| ***The subscription associated with your storage resource***.|
    |**Resource**| ***The name of your storage resource***.
    |**Role** | ***Storage Blob Data Contributor***.|

1. After the *Added Role assignment* confirmation message appears, refresh the page to see the added role assignment.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/managed-identities/add-role-assignment-confirmation.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Added role assignment confirmation pop-up message.":::

1. If you don't see the new role assignment right away, wait and try refreshing the page again. When you assign or remove role assignments, it can take up to 30 minutes for changes to take effect.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/managed-identities/assigned-roles-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Azure role assignments window.":::
