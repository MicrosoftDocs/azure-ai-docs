# Create a text translation flow (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * The Translator connector is currently available in public preview. Features, approaches, and processes can change, before General Availability (GA) release, based on user feedback.

This article guides you through configuring a Microsoft Translator V3 connector cloud flow that supports text translation and transliteration. The Translator V3 connector creates a connection between your Translator Service instance and Microsoft Power Automate enabling you to use one or more prebuilt operations as steps in your apps and workflows.

Text translation is a cloud-based REST API feature of the Azure AI Translator service. The Text Translation API enables quick and accurate source-to-target text translations in real time.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need  an active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).

* Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [**single-service Translator resource**](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextTranslation) (**not** a multi-service Azure AI services resource):

* You need the key and name from your resource to connect your application to Power Automate. Your Translator resource keys are found under the Resource Management section in the Azure portal and your resource name is located at the top of the page. Copy and paste your key and resource name in a convenient location, such as *Microsoft Notepad*.

## Configure the Translator V3 connector

Now that you completed the prerequisites, let's get started.

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/).

1. Select **Create** from the left sidebar menu.

1. Select **Instant cloud flow** from the main content area.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/connectors/create-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to create an instant cloud flow.":::

1. In the popup window, **name your flow**, choose **Manually trigger a flow** then, select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/connectors/select-manual-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to manually trigger a flow.":::

1. The first step for your instant flow—**Manually trigger a flow**—appears on screen. Select **New step**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/connectors/add-new-step.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add new flow step page.":::

## Test your connector flow

Let's test the cloud flow and view the translated text.

1. There's a green bar at the top of the page indicating that **Your flow is ready to go.**.

1. Select **Test Flow** → **Manually** → **Test** from the right-side window.
1. In the next window, select the  **Run flow** button. 
1. Finally, select  the **Done** button.
1. You should receive a "Your flow ran successfully" message and green check marks align with each successful step.
