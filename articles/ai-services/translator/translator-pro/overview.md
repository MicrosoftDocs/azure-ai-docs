For example, an identity created in the commercial cloud can't be used to access an Azure resource in the government cloud via this app.

* This app operates as a paid offering, necessitating payment before usage.

* The app preview is initially available only to enterprises in the United States that meet certain criteria.

* Offline translation is limited to a select number of languages.

## Core features and capabilities

* **Eliminate language barriers**. Real-time speech-to-speech translation allows seamless communication between individuals speaking different languages.

* **Unified efficient experience**. Both transcription and translation can be viewed or heard simultaneously on a single device, ensuring smooth and efficient conversations.

* **Offline usage capability**. The app's speech-to-speech translation capability can be utilized without an internet connection in limited languages, maintaining productivity without interruption.

* **Full administrator control**. Your enterprise IT administrator has extensive control over the app's deployment and usage within your organization. Administrators can fine-tune settings to manage conversation history, audit trails, and diagnostic logs. Additionally, administrators have the ability to disable history or configure the automatic exportation of the history to cloud storage.

* **Enterprise-grade security**. Microsoft Translator Pro ensures exceptional translation quality paired with robust security features. Recognizing that privacy and security are paramount for your organization, administrators can sign in to the app using organizational credentials.
