This approach greatly minimizes the possibility of unauthorized access to sensitive information or critical functions within your API.<br>
For more information, *see* [Managed identities: role-based access control](/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/create-use-managed-identities)

* **Authentication**. Access to Translator data should be limited solely to entities that successfully complete authentication. This restriction requires users to successfully complete verification and receive authorization before they can view or modify Translator data. Only users with proper approval gain access or editing privileges. This approach provides a layer of security by making certain that unauthorized users can't access sensitive information or make changes that could impact the integrity of the data.<br>
For more information, *see* [Authentication and authorization](/azure/ai-services/translator/text-translation/reference/authentication)

* **Azure Key Vault**. Azure Key Vault offers a secure, centralized repository for application secrets like database connection strings, API keys, customer managed keys (CMK), passwords, and cryptographic keys. Using the key vault eliminates the need to hard-code sensitive information directly into application code or configuration files, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.<br>
For more information, *see* [About Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview).<br>
For Custom Translator implementation, *see* [Encryption key management](/azure/ai-services/translator/custom-translator/concepts/encrypt-data-at-rest)<br><br>

   > [!TIP]
   > ✔️ **Rotate API keys regularly**: Keys in Azure Key Vault can be configured with rotation policies that automatically generate new key versions at specified frequencies. Regularly rotating your Translator service API keys mitigates the risk of compromised credentials being used to access your services. For more information, *see* [Key autorotation](/azure/key-vault/general/autorotation).
