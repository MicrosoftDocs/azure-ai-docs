# How to prevent translation of content with Azure AI Translator

Azure AI Translator allows you to tag content so that it isn't translated. For example, you might want to tag code, a brand name, or a word/phrase that doesn't make sense when localized.

## Methods for preventing translation

1. Tag your content with `notranslate`. It's by design that this works only when the input textType is set as HTML

   Example:

   ```html
   <span class="notranslate">This will not be translated.</span>
   <span>This will be translated. </span>
   ```

   ```html
   <div class="notranslate">This will not be translated.</div>
   <div>This will be translated. </div>
   ```

2. Tag your content with `translate="no"`. This tag only works when the input textType is set as HTML

   Example:

   ```html
   <span translate="no">This will not be translated.</span>
   <span>This will be translated. </span>
   ```

   ```html
   <div translate="no">This will not be translated.</div>
   <div>This will be translated. </div>
   ```

3. Use the [dynamic dictionary](../../dynamic-dictionary.md) to prescribe a specific translation.

4. Don't pass the string to the Translator for translation.

5. Custom Translator: Use a [dictionary in Custom Translator](../../custom-translator/concepts/dictionaries.md) to prescribe the translation of a phrase with 100% probability.
