# Azure AI Translator response codes and messages

When you use `HTTP` protocol to access content on a server running `IIS`, the server returns a numeric code indicating the outcome of the request and the nature of the response, including its success or failure.
The status code's first digit categorizes the response class, while the last two digits serve no classification purpose. The first digit can be one of five values:

* **1xx** (Informational): An interim response indicating that the request was received and processing continues.
* **2xx** (Successful): The server successfully received and accepted the client request.
* **3xx** (Redirection): More action is required to complete the request.
* **4xx** (Client Error): An error occurred originating with the client browser and can't be fulfilled.
* **5xx** (Server Error): The server encountered an error and the request failed.

## Status codes

The following are the possible HTTP status codes that a request returns.

|Status code | Description |
| --- | --- |
|200 | Success. |
|400 |One of the query parameters is missing or not valid. Correct request parameters before retrying. |
|401 | The request couldn't be authenticated. Check that credentials are specified and valid. |
|403 | The request isn't authorized. Check the details error message. This status code often indicates that you used all the free translations provided with a trial subscription. |
|408 | The request couldn't be fulfilled because a resource is missing. Check the details error message. When the request includes a custom category, this status code often indicates that the custom translation system isn't yet available to serve requests. The request should be retried after a waiting period (for example, 1 minute). |
|429 | The server rejected the request because the client exceeded request limits. |
|500 |  An unexpected error occurred. If the error persists, report it with: date and time of the failure, request identifier from response header X-RequestId, and client identifier from request header X-ClientTraceId. |
|503 |Server temporarily unavailable. Retry the request. If the error persists, report it with: date and time of the failure, request identifier from response header X-RequestId, and client identifier from request header X-ClientTraceId. |

If an error occurs, the request returns a JSON error response. The error code is a 6-digit number combining the 3-digit HTTP status code followed by a 3-digit number to further categorize the error:

## Error codes

A standard error response is a JSON object with name/value pair named `error`. The value is also a JSON object with properties:

* `code`: A server-defined error code.
* `message`: A string giving a human-readable representation of the error.

For example, a customer with a free trial subscription would receive the following error once the free quota is exhausted:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code":403001,
    "message":"The operation isn't allowed because the subscription has exceeded its free quota."
    }
}
```

The error code is a 6-digit number combining the 3-digit HTTP status code followed by a 3-digit number to further categorize the error. Common error codes are:
