# Azure AI Translator v3.0: detect

Identifies the language of a piece of text.

## Request URL

Send a `POST` request to:

```bash
https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/detect?api-version=3.0

```

_See_ [**Virtual Network Support**](../authentication.md#virtual-network-support) for Translator service selected network and private endpoint configuration and support.

## Request parameters

Request parameters passed on the query string are:

| Query parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| api-version | *Required parameter*.<br>Version of the API requested by the client. Value must be `3.0`. |

Request headers include:

| Headers | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication headers | <em>Required request header</em>.<br>*See* [available options for authentication](../authentication.md). |
| Content-Type | _Required request header_.<br>Specifies the content type of the payload. Accepted values are: `application/json`. |
| Content-Length | _Optional_.<br>The length of the request body. |
| X-ClientTraceId | _Optional_.<br>A client-generated GUID to uniquely identify the request. You can omit this optional header if you include the trace ID in the query string using a query parameter named `ClientTraceId`. |

## Request body

The body of the request is a JSON array. Each array element is a JSON object with a string property named `Text`. Language detection is applied to the value of the `Text` property. The language autodetection works better with longer input text. A sample request body looks like that:

```json
[
    { "Text": "Ich würde wirklich gerne Ihr Auto ein paar Mal um den Block fahren." }
]
```

The following limitations apply:

* The array can have at most 100 elements.
* The entire text included in the request can't exceed 50,000 characters including spaces.

## Response body

A successful response is a JSON array with one result for each string in the input array. A result object includes the following properties:

* `language`: Code of the detected language.

* `score`: A float value indicating the confidence in the result. The score is between zero and one and a low score indicates a low confidence.

* `isTranslationSupported`: A boolean value that is true if the detected language is one of the languages supported for text translation.

* `isTransliterationSupported`: A boolean value that is true if the detected language is one of the languages supported for transliteration.

* `alternatives`: An array of other possible languages. Each element of the array is another object the following properties: `language`, `score`, `isTranslationSupported`, and `isTransliterationSupported`.

An example JSON response is:

```json
[

    {

        "language": "de",

        "score": 1.0,

        "isTranslationSupported": true,

        "isTransliterationSupported": false

    }

]
```

## Response headers

| Headers | Description |
| --- | --- |
| X-RequestId | Value generated by the service to identify the request and used for troubleshooting purposes. |

## Response status codes

If an error occurs, the request returns a JSON error response. The error code is a 6-digit number combining the 3-digit HTTP status code followed by a 3-digit number to further categorize the error. Common error codes can be found on the [Translator status code reference page](../status-response-codes.md).

## Examples

The following example shows how to retrieve languages supported for text translation.

 ```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/detect?api-version=3.0" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <client-secret>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "[{'Text':'What language is this text written in?'}]"
```
