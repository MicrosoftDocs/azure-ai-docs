# Translator 3.0: Transliterate

Converts text in one language from one script to another script.

## Request URL

Send a `POST` request to:

```HTTP
https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/transliterate?api-version=3.0
```

_See_ [**Virtual Network Support**](reference.md#virtual-network-support) for Translator service selected network and private endpoint configuration and support.

## Request parameters

Request parameters passed on the query string are:

| Query parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| api-version | *Required parameter*.<br/>Version of the API requested by the client. Value must be `3.0`. |
| language | *Required parameter*.<br/>Specifies the language of the text to convert from one script to another. Possible languages are listed in the `transliteration` scope obtained by querying the service for its [supported languages](languages.md). |
| fromScript | *Required parameter*.<br/>Specifies the script used by the input text. Look up [supported languages](languages.md) using the `transliteration` scope, to find input scripts available for the selected language. |
| toScript | *Required parameter*.<br/>Specifies the output script. Look up [supported languages](languages.md) using the `transliteration` scope, to find output scripts available for the selected combination of input language and input script. |

Request headers include:

| Headers | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication headers | _Required request header_.<br/>See [available options for authentication](reference.md#authentication). |
| Content-Type | _Required request header_.<br/>Specifies the content type of the payload. Possible values are: `application/json` |
| Content-Length | _Optional_.<br/>The length of the request body. |
| X-ClientTraceId | _Optional_.<br/>A client-generated GUID to uniquely identify the request. You can omit this header if you include the trace ID in the query string using a query parameter named `ClientTraceId`. |

## Request body

The body of the request is a JSON array. Each array element is a JSON object with a string property named `Text`, which represents the string to convert.

```json
[
    {"Text":"こんにちは"},
    {"Text":"さようなら"}
]
```

The following limitations apply:

* The array can have at most 10 elements.
* The text value of an array element can't exceed 1,000 characters including spaces.
* The entire text included in the request can't exceed 5,000 characters including spaces.

## Response body

A successful response is a JSON array with one result for each element in the input array. A result object includes the following properties:

* `text`: A string that results from converting the input string to the output script.

* `script`: A string specifying the script used in the output.

An example JSON response is:

```json
[
    {"text":"konnnichiha","script":"Latn"},
    {"text":"sayounara","script":"Latn"}
]
```

## Response headers

| Headers | Description |
| --- | --- |
| X-RequestId | Value generated by the service to identify the request and used for troubleshooting purposes. |

## Response status codes

The following are the possible HTTP status codes that a request returns.

| Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Success. |
| 400 | One of the query parameters is missing or not valid. Correct request parameters before retrying. |
| 401 | The request couldn't be authenticated. Check that credentials are specified and valid. |
| 403 | The request isn't authorized. Check the details error message. This code often indicates that all free translations provided with a trial subscription are used. |
| 429 | The server rejected the request because the client exceeded request limits. |
| 500 | An unexpected error occurred. If the error persists, report it with: date and time of the failure, request identifier from response header `X-RequestId`, and client identifier from request header `X-ClientTraceId`. |
| 503 | Server temporarily unavailable. Retry the request. If the error persists, report it with: date and time of the failure, request identifier from response header `X-RequestId`, and client identifier from request header `X-ClientTraceId`. |

If an error occurs, the request also returns a JSON error response. The error code is a 6-digit number combining the 3-digit HTTP status code followed by a 3-digit number to further categorize the error. Common error codes can be found on the [v3 Translator reference page](reference.md#errors).

## Examples

The following example shows how to convert two Japanese strings into Romanized Japanese.

The JSON payload for the request in this example:

```json
[{"text":"こんにちは","script":"jpan"},{"text":"さようなら","script":"jpan"}]
```

If you're using cURL in a command-line window that doesn't support Unicode characters, take the following JSON payload and save it into a file named `request.txt`. Be sure to save the file with `UTF-8` encoding.

```
curl -X POST "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/transliterate?api-version=3.0&language=ja&fromScript=Jpan&toScript=Latn" -H "X-ClientTraceId: 875030C7-5380-40B8-8A03-63DACCF69C11" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <client-secret>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @request.txt
```
