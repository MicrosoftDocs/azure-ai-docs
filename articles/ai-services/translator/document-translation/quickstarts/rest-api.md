# Get started: Document translation REST APIs
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 -->

Document translation is a cloud-based feature of the [Azure AI Translator](../../translator-overview.md) service that asynchronously translates whole documents in [supported languages](../../language-support.md) and various [file formats](../overview.md#batch-supported-document-formats). In this quickstart, learn to use Document translation with a programming language of your choice to translate a source document into a target language while preserving structure and text formatting.

The Document translation API supports two translation processes:

* [Asynchronous batch translation](#asynchronously-translate-documents-post) supports the processing of multiple documents and large files. The batch translation process requires an Azure Blob storage account with storage containers for your source and translated documents.

* [Synchronous single file](#synchronously-translate-a-single-document-post) supports the processing of single file translations. The file translation process doesn't require an Azure Blob storage account. The final response contains the translated document and is returned directly to the calling client.

***Let's get started.***

## Prerequisites

You need an active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).

* Once you have your Azure subscription, create an [Azure AI Translator resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextTranslation) in the Azure portal.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > * For this quickstart, we recommend that you use an Azure AI Translator text single-service global resource unless your business or application requires a specific region. If you're planning on using a [system-assigned managed identity](../how-to-guides/create-use-managed-identities.md) for authentication, choose a **geographic** region like **West US**.
    > * With a single-service global resource, you include one authorization header (**Ocp-Apim-Subscription-key**) with the REST API request. The value for `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-key` is your Azure secret key for your Azure AI Translator Text subscription.

* After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** and retrieve your key and endpoint.

  * You need the key and endpoint from the resource to connect your application to the Azure AI Translator service. You paste your key and endpoint into the code later in the quickstart. You can find these values on the Azure portal **Keys and Endpoint** page.

* For this project, we use the cURL command line tool to make REST API calls.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The cURL package is preinstalled on most Windows 10 and Windows 11 and most macOS and Linux distributions. You can check the package version with the following commands:
    > Windows: `curl.exe -V`
    > macOS `curl -V`
    > Linux: `curl --version`

* If cURL isn't installed, here are installation links for your platform:

  * [Windows](https://curl.haxx.se/windows/)
  * [Mac or Linux](https://learn2torials.com/thread/how-to-install-curl-on-mac-or-linux-(ubuntu)-or-windows)

## Asynchronously translate documents (POST)

1. Using your preferred editor or IDE, create a new directory for your app named `document-translation`.

1. Create a new json file called **document-translation.json** in your **document-translation** directory.

1. Copy and paste the document translation **request sample** into your `document-translation.json` file. Replace **`{your-source-container-SAS-URL}`** and **`{your-target-container-SAS-URL}`** with values from your Azure portal Storage account containers instance.

    ***Request sample:***

    ```json
    {
      "inputs":[
        {
          "source":{
            "sourceUrl":"{your-source-container-SAS-URL}"
          },
          "targets":[
            {
              "targetUrl":"{your-target-container-SAS-URL}",
              "language":"fr"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### Build and run the POST request

Before you run the **POST** request, replace `{your-document-translator-endpoint}` and `{your-key}` with the values from your Azure portal Azure AI Translator instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). For more information, *see* Azure AI services [security](../../../security-features.md).

***PowerShell***

```powershell
cmd /c curl "{document-translation-endpoint}/translator/document/batches?api-version={date}" -i -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: {your-key}" --data "@document-translation.json"
```

***command prompt / terminal***

```bash
curl "{document-translation-endpoint}/translator/document/batches?api-version={date}" -i -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: {your-key}" --data "@document-translation.json"
```

Upon successful completion:

* The translated documents can be found in your target container.
* The successful POST method returns a `202 Accepted` response code indicating that the service created the batch request.
* The POST request also returns response headers including `Operation-Location` that provides a value used in subsequent GET requests.

## Synchronously translate a single document (POST)

To call the synchronous translation feature via the [REST API](../reference/synchronous-rest-api-guide.md), you need to include the following headers with each request. Don't worry, we include the headers for you in the sample code.

> [!NOTE]
> All cURL flags and command line options are **case-sensitive**.

|Query parameter&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|Description| Condition|
|---------|---------|----|
|`-X` or `--request` `POST`|The -X flag specifies the request method to access the API.|***Required*** |
|`{endpoint}`  |The URL for your Document translation resource endpoint|***Required*** |
|`targetLanguage`|Specifies the language of the output document. The target language must be one of the supported languages included in the translation scope.|***Required*** |
|`sourceLanguage`|Specifies the language of the input document. If the `sourceLanguage` parameter isn't specified, automatic language detection is applied to determine the source language. |***Optional***|
|`-H` or `--header` `"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key:{KEY}`    | Request header that specifies the Document translation resource key authorizing access to the API.|***Required***|
|`-F` or `--form` |The filepath to the document that you want to include with your request. Only one source document is allowed.|***Required***|
|&bull; `document=`<br> &bull; `type={contentType}/fileExtension` |&bull; Path to the file location for your source document.</br> &bull; Content type and file extension.</br></br> Ex: **"document=@C:\Test\test-file.md;type=text/markdown**|***Required***|
|`-o` or `--output`|The filepath to the response results.|***Required***|
|`-F` or `--form` |The filepath to an optional glossary to include with your request. The glossary requires a separate `--form` flag.|***Optional***|
| &bull; `glossary=`<br> &bull; `type={contentType}/fileExtension`|&bull; Path to the file location for your optional glossary file.</br> &bull; Content type and file extension.</br></br> Ex: **"glossary=@C:\Test\glossary-file.txt;type=text/plain**|***Optional***|

✔️ For more information on **`contentType`**, *see* [**Supported document formats**](../overview.md#synchronous-supported-document-formats).

### Build and run the synchronous POST request

1. For this project, you need a **sample document**. You can download our [Microsoft Word sample document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/Translator/document-translation-sample.docx) for this quickstart. The source language is English.

1. Before you run the **POST** request, replace `{your-document-translation-endpoint}` and `{your-key}` with the values from your Azure portal Azure AI Translator service instance.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). For more information, *see* Azure AI services [security](/azure/ai-services/security-features).

   ***command prompt / terminal***

    ```bash

    curl -i -X POST "{document-translation-endpoint}/translator/document:translate?targetLanguage={target_language}&api-version={date}" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key:{your-key}"  -F "document={path-to-your-document-with-file-extension};type={ContentType}/{file-extension}" -F "glossary={path-to-your-glossary-with-file-extension};type={ContentType}/{file-extension}" -o "{path-to-output-file}"
    ```

    ***PowerShell***

    ```powershell
    cmd /c curl "{document-translation-endpoint}/translator/document:translate?targetLanguage={target_language}&api-version={date}" -i -X POST  -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: {your-key}" -F "{path-to-your-document-with-file-extension};type=text/{file-extension}" -o "{path-to-output-file}

    ```

    ✔️ For more information on **`Query parameters`**, *see* [**synchronous document translation**](../reference/translate-document.md).

***Upon successful completion***:

* The translated document is returned with the response.
* The successful POST method returns a `200 OK` response code indicating that the service created the request.

That's it, congratulations! You just learned to translate documents using the Azure AI Translator service.
