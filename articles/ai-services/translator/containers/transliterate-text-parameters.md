### Sample request

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/transliterate?api-version=3.0&language=ja&fromScript=Jpan&toScript=Latn"
```

### Sample request body

The body of the request is a JSON array. Each array element is a JSON object with a string property named `Text`, which represents the string to convert.

```json
[
    {"Text":"こんにちは"},
    {"Text":"さようなら"}
]
```

The following limitations apply:

* The array can have a maximum of 10 elements.
* The text value of an array element can't exceed 1,000 characters including spaces.
* The entire text included in the request can't exceed 5,000 characters including spaces.

### Sample JSON response:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Kon'nichiwa​",
    "script": "Latn"
  },
  {
    "text": "sayonara",
    "script": "Latn"
  }
]
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Each sample runs on the `localhost` that you specified with the `docker run` command.
> * While your container is running, `localhost` points to the container itself.
> * You don't have to use `localhost:5000`. You can use any port that isn't already in use in your host environment.
