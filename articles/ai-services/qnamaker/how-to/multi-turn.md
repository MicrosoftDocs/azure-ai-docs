# Use follow-up prompts to create multiple turns of a conversation

Use follow-up prompts and context to manage the multiple turns, known as _multi-turn_, for your bot from one question to another.

To see how multi-turn works, view the following demonstration video:

[![Multi-turn conversation in QnA Maker](../media/conversational-context/youtube-video.png)](https://aka.ms/multiturnexample)

[!INCLUDE [Custom question answering](../includes/new-version.md)]

## What is a multi-turn conversation?

Some questions can't be answered in a single turn. When you design your client application (chat bot) conversations, a user might ask a question that needs to be filtered or refined to determine the correct answer. You make this flow through the questions possible by presenting the user with *follow-up prompts*.

When a user asks a question, QnA Maker returns the answer _and_ any follow-up prompts. This response allows you to present the follow-up questions as choices.

> [!CAUTION]
> Multi-turn prompts are not extracted from FAQ documents. If you need multi-turn extraction, remove the question marks that designate the QnA pairs as FAQs.

## Example multi-turn conversation with chat bot

With multi-turn, a chat bot manages a conversation with a user to determine the final answer, as shown in the following image:

![A multi-turn dialog with prompts that guide a user through a conversation](../media/conversational-context/conversation-in-bot.png)

In the preceding image, a user has started a conversation by entering **My account**. The knowledge base has three linked question-and-answer pairs. To refine the answer, the user selects one of the three choices in the knowledge base. The question (#1), has three follow-up prompts, which are presented in the chat bot as three options (#2).

When the user selects an option (#3), the next list of refining options (#4) is presented. This sequence continues (#5) until the user determines the correct, final answer (#6).

### Use multi-turn in a bot

After publishing your KB, you can select the **Create Bot** button to deploy your QnA Maker bot to Azure AI Bot Service. The prompts will appear in the chat clients that you have enabled for your bot.

## Create a multi-turn conversation from a document's structure

When you create a knowledge base, the **Populate your KB** section displays an **Enable multi-turn extraction from URLs, .pdf or .docx files** check box.

![Check box for enabling multi-turn extraction](../media/conversational-context/enable-multi-turn.png)

When you select this option, QnA Maker extracts the hierarchy present in the document structure. The hierarchy is converted in to follow up prompts and the root of the hierarchy serves as the parent QnA. In some documents, the root of the hierarchy does not have content, which could serve as an answer. You can provide the 'Default Answer Text' to be used as a substitute answer text to extract such hierarchies.

Multi-turn structure can be inferred only from URLs, PDF files, or DOCX files. For an example of structure, view an image of a [Microsoft Surface user manual PDF file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/qna-maker/data-source-formats/product-manual.pdf).

:::image type="content" source="../media/conversational-context/import-file-with-conversational-structure.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of the structure in a user manual." lightbox="../media/conversational-context/import-file-with-conversational-structure.png":::

### Building your own multi-turn document

If you are creating a multi-turn document, keep in mind the following guidelines:

* Use headings and sub-headings to denote hierarchy. For example, use a h1 to denote the parent QnA and h2 to denote the QnA that should be taken as prompt. Use small heading size to denote subsequent hierarchy. Don't use style, color, or some other mechanism to imply structure in your document, QnA Maker will not extract the multi-turn prompts.

* First character of heading must be capitalized.

* Do not end a heading with a question mark, `?`.

* You can use the [sample document](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/qna-maker/data-source-formats/multi-turn.docx) as an example to create your own multi-turn document.

### Adding files to a multi-turn KB

When you add a hierarchical document, QnA Maker determines follow-up prompts from the structure to create conversational flow.

1. In QnA Maker, select an existing knowledge base, which was created with **Enable multi-turn extraction from URLs, .pdf or .docx files** enabled.
1. Go to the **Settings** page, select the file or URL to add.
1. **Save and train** the knowledge base.

> [!Caution]
> Support for using an exported TSV or XLS multi-turn knowledge base file as a data source for a new or empty knowledge base isn't supported. You need to **Import** that file type, from the **Settings** page of the QnA Maker portal, in order to add exported multi-turn prompts to a knowledge base.

## Create knowledge base with multi-turn prompts with the Create API

You can create a knowledge case with multi-turn prompts using the [QnA Maker Create API](/rest/api/qnamaker/knowledgebase/create). The prompts are adding in the `context` property's `prompts` array.

## Show questions and answers with context

Reduce the displayed question-and-answer pairs to only those pairs with contextual conversations.

Select **View options**, and then select **Show context**. The list displays question-and-answer pairs that contain follow-up prompts.

![Filter question-and-answer pairs by contextual conversations](../media/conversational-context/filter-question-and-answers-by-context.png)

The multi-turn context is displayed in the first column.

:::image type="content" source="../media/conversational-context/surface-manual-pdf-follow-up-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Context section highlighted." lightbox="../media/conversational-context/surface-manual-pdf-follow-up-prompt.png":::

In the preceding image, **#1** indicates bold text in the column, which signifies the current question. The parent question is the top item in the row. Any questions below it are the linked question-and-answer pairs. These items are selectable, so that you can immediately go to the other context items.

## Add an existing question-and-answer pair as a follow-up prompt

The original question, **My account**, has follow-up prompts, such as **Accounts and signing in**.

![The "Accounts and signing in" answers and follow-up prompts](../media/conversational-context/detected-and-linked-follow-up-prompts.png)

Add a follow-up prompt to an existing question-and-answer pair that isn't currently linked. Because the question isn't linked to any question-and-answer pair, the current view setting needs to be changed.

1. To link an existing question-and-answer pair as a follow-up prompt, select the row for the question-and-answer pair. For the Surface manual, search for **Sign out** to reduce the list.
1. In the row for **Signout**, in the **Answer** column, select **Add follow-up prompt**.
1. In the fields in the **Follow-up prompt** pop-up window, enter the following values:

    |Field|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Display text|Enter **Turn off the device**. This is custom text to display in the follow-up prompt.|
    |Context-only| Select this check box. An answer is returned only if the question specifies context.|
    |Link to answer|Enter **Use the sign-in screen** to find the existing question-and-answer pair.|

1.  One match is returned. Select this answer as the follow-up, and then select **Save**.

    ![The "Follow-up prompt" page](../media/conversational-context/search-follow-up-prompt-for-existing-answer.png)

1. After you've added the follow-up prompt, select **Save and train** in the top navigation.

### Edit the display text

When a follow-up prompt is created, and an existing question-and-answer pair is entered as the **Link to Answer**, you can enter new **Display text**. This text doesn't replace the existing question, and it doesn't add a new alternate question. It is separate from those values.

1. To edit the display text, search for and select the question in the **Context** field.
1. In the row for that question, select the follow-up prompt in the answer column.
1. Select the display text you want to edit, and then select **Edit**.

    ![The Edit command for the display text](../media/conversational-context/edit-existing-display-text.png)

1. In the **Follow-up prompt** pop-up window, change the existing display text.
1. When you're done editing the display text, select **Save**.
1. In the top navigation bar, **Save and train**.

## Add a new question-and-answer pair as a follow-up prompt

When you add a new question-and-answer pair to the knowledge base, each pair should be linked to an existing question as a follow-up prompt.

1. On the knowledge base toolbar, search for and select the existing question-and-answer pair for **Accounts and signing in**.

1. In the **Answer** column for this question, select **Add follow-up prompt**.
1. Under **Follow-up prompt (PREVIEW)**, create a new follow-up prompt by entering the following values:

    |Field|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Display text|*Create a Windows Account*. The custom text to display in the follow-up prompt.|
    |Context-only|Select this check box. This answer is returned only if the question specifies context.|
    |Link to answer|Enter the following text as the answer:<br>*[Create](https://account.microsoft.com/) a Windows account with a new or existing email account*.<br>When you save and train the database, this text will be converted. |
    |||

    ![Create a new prompt question and answer](../media/conversational-context/create-child-prompt-from-parent.png)

1. Select **Create new**, and then select **Save**.

    This action creates a new question-and-answer pair and links the selected question as a follow-up prompt. The **Context** column, for both questions, indicates a follow-up prompt relationship.

1. Select **View options**, and then select [**Show context (PREVIEW)**](#show-questions-and-answers-with-context).

    The new question shows how it's linked.

    ![Create a new follow-up prompt](../media/conversational-context/new-qna-follow-up-prompt.png)

    The parent question displays a new question as one of its choices.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/conversational-context/child-prompt-created.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Context column, for both questions, indicates a follow-up prompt relationship." lightbox="../media/conversational-context/child-prompt-created.png":::

1. After you've added the follow-up prompt, select **Save and train** in the top navigation bar.

## Query the knowledge base with the QnA Maker ID

If you are building a custom application, in the initial question's response, any follow-up prompts, and its associated `qnaId` are returned. Now that you have the ID, you can pass it in the follow-up prompt's request body. If the request body contains the `qnaId`, and the context object (which contains the previous QnA Maker properties), then GenerateAnswer will return the exact question by ID, instead of using the ranking algorithm to find the answer by the question text.

## Display order is supported in the Update API

The [display text and display order](/rest/api/qnamaker/knowledgebase/update#promptdto), returned in the JSON response, is supported for editing by the [Update API](/rest/api/qnamaker/knowledgebase/update).

## Add or delete multi-turn prompts with the Update API

You can add or delete multi-turn prompts using the [QnA Maker Update API](/rest/api/qnamaker/knowledgebase/update).  The prompts are adding in the `context` property's `promptsToAdd` array and the `promptsToDelete` array.

## Export knowledge base for version control

QnA Maker supports version control by including multi-turn conversation steps in the exported file.
