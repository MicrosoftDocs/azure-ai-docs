# Importing from data sources

A knowledge base consists of question and answer pairs brought in by public URLs and files.

[!INCLUDE [Custom question answering](../includes/new-version.md)]

## Data source locations

Content is brought into a knowledge base from a data source. Data source locations are **public URLs or files**, which do not require authentication.

[SharePoint files](../how-to/add-sharepoint-datasources.md), secured with authentication, are the exception. SharePoint resources must be files, not web pages. 

QnA Maker supports public URLs ending with a .ASPX web extension which are not secured with authentication.

## Chit-chat content

The chit-chat content set is offered as a complete content data source in several languages and conversational styles. This can be a starting point for your bot's personality, and it will save you the time and cost of writing them from scratch. Learn [how to add chit-chat content](../how-to/chit-chat-knowledge-base.md) to your knowledge base.

## Structured data format through import

Importing a knowledge base replaces the content of the existing knowledge base. Import requires a structured `.tsv` file that contains questions and answers. This information helps QnA Maker group the question-answer pairs and attribute them to a particular data source.

| Question  | Answer  | Source| Metadata (1 key: 1 value) |
|-----------|---------|----|---------------------|
| Question1 | Answer1 | Url1 | <code>Key1:Value1 &#124; Key2:Value2</code> |
| Question2 | Answer2 | Editorial|    `Key:Value`       |

## Structured multi-turn format through import

You can create the multi-turn conversations in a `.tsv` file format. The format provides you with the ability to create the multi-turn conversations by analyzing previous chat logs (with other processes, not using QnA Maker), then create the `.tsv` file through automation. Import the file to replace the existing knowledge base.

> ![Conceptual model of 3 levels of multi-turn question](../media/qnamaker-concepts-knowledgebase/nested-multi-turn.png)

The column for a multi-turn `.tsv`, specific to multi-turn is **Prompts**. An example `.tsv`, shown in Excel, show the information to include to define the multi-turn children:

```JSON
[
    {"displayOrder":0,"qnaId":2,"displayText":"Level 2 Question A"},
    {"displayOrder":0,"qnaId":3,"displayText":"Level 2 - Question B"}
]
```

The **displayOrder** is numeric and the **displayText** is text that shouldn't include markdown.

## Export as example

If you are unsure how to represent your QnA pair in the `.tsv` file:
* Use this [downloadable example from GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/qna-maker/data-source-formats/Structured-multi-turn-format.xlsx?raw=true)
* Or create the pair in the QnA Maker portal, save, then export the knowledge base for an example of how to represent the pair.

## Unstructured data format 

You can also create a knowledge base based on unstructured content imported via a file. Currently this functionality is available only via document upload for documents that are in any of the supported file formats.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The support for unstructured content via file upload is available only in [question answering](../../language-service/question-answering/overview.md).

## Content types of documents you can add to a knowledge base
Content types include many standard structured documents such as PDF, DOC, and TXT.

### File and URL data types

If you need authentication for your data source, consider the following methods to get that content into QnA Maker:

* Download the file manually and import into QnA Maker
* Add the file from authenticated [SharePoint location](../how-to/add-sharepoint-datasources.md)

### URL content

Two types of documents can be imported via **URL** in QnA Maker:

* FAQ URLs
* Support URLs

Each type indicates an expected format.

### File-based content

You can add files to a knowledge base from a public source, or your local file system, in the [QnA Maker portal](https://www.qnamaker.ai).

### Content format guidelines

Learn more about the [format guidelines](../reference-document-format-guidelines.md) for the different files.
