# Service configuration

Each version of QnA Maker uses a different set of Azure resources (services). This article describes the supported customizations for these services. 

## App Service

QnA Maker uses the App Service to provide the query runtime used by the [generateAnswer API](/rest/api/qnamaker/runtime/generate-answer).

These settings are available in the Azure portal, for the App Service. The settings are available by selecting **Settings**, then **Configuration**.

You can set an individual setting either through the Application Settings list, or modify several settings by selecting **Advanced edit**.

|Resource|Setting|
|--|--|
|AzureSearchAdminKey|Cognitive Search - used for QnA pair storage and Ranker #1|
|AzureSearchName|Cognitive Search - used for QnA pair storage and Ranker #1|
|DefaultAnswer|Text of answer when no match is found|
|UserAppInsightsAppId|Chat log and telemetry|
|UserAppInsightsKey|Chat log and telemetry|
|UserAppInsightsName|Chat log and telemetry|
|QNAMAKER_EXTENSION_VERSION|Always set to _latest_. This setting will initialize the QnAMaker Site Extension in the App Service.|

You need to **restart** the service from the **Overview** page of the Azure portal, once you are done making changes.
