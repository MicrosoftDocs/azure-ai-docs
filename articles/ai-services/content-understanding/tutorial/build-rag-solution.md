* The multimodal data used in this tutorial consists of documents, images, audio, and video. They're designed to guide you through the process of building a robust RAG solution with Azure AI Content Understanding.

## Extract data

Retrieval-augmented generation (*RAG**) is a method that enhances the functionality of Large Language Models (**LLM**) by integrating data from external knowledge sources. Building a robust multimodal RAG solution begins with extracting and structuring data from diverse content types. Azure AI Content Understanding provides three key components to facilitate this process: **content extraction**, **field extraction**, and **analyzers**. Together, these components form the foundation for creating a unified, reusable, and enhanced data pipeline for RAG workflows.

## Implementation steps

To implement data extraction in Content Understanding, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Analyzer:** Define an analyzer using REST APIs or our Python code samples.

1. **Perform Content Extraction:** Use the analyzer to process files and extract structured content.

1. **(Optional) Enhance with Field Extraction:** Optionally, specify AI-generated fields to enrich the extracted content with added metadata.

## Create analyzers

Analyzers are reusable components in Content Understanding that streamline the data extraction process. Once an analyzer is created, it can be used repeatedly to process files and extract content or fields based on predefined schemas. An analyzer acts as a blueprint for how data should be processed, ensuring consistency and efficiency across multiple files and content types.

The following code samples demonstrate how to create analyzers for each modality, specifying the structured data to be extracted, such as key fields, summaries, or classifications. These analyzers serve as the foundation for extracting and enriching content in your RAG solution.

#### Code sample: create analyzer

``` python
from pathlib import Path
from python.content_understanding_client import AzureContentUnderstandingClient
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default")

#set analyzer configs
analyzer_configs = [
    {
        "id": "doc-analyzer" + str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "template_path": "../analyzer_templates/content_document.json",
        "location": Path("../data/sample_layout.pdf"),
    },
    {
        "id": "image-analyzer" + str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "template_path": "../analyzer_templates/image_chart_diagram_understanding.json",
        "location": Path("../data/sample_report.pdf"),
    },
    {
        "id": "audio-analyzer" + str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "template_path": "../analyzer_templates/call_recording_analytics.json",
        "location": Path("../data/callCenterRecording.mp3"),
    },
    {
        "id": "video-analyzer" + str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "template_path": "../analyzer_templates/video_content_understanding.json",
        "location": Path("../data/FlightSimulator.mp4"),
    },
]

# Create Content Understanding client
content_understanding_client = AzureContentUnderstandingClient(
    endpoint=AZURE_AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT,
    api_version=AZURE_AI_SERVICE_API_VERSION,
    token_provider=token_provider,
    x_ms_useragent="azure-ai-content-understanding-python/content_extraction", # This header is used for sample usage telemetry, please comment out this line if you want to opt out.
)

# Iterate through each config and create an analyzer
for analyzer in analyzer_configs:
    analyzer_id = analyzer["id"]
    template_path = analyzer["template_path"]

    try:

        # Create the analyzer using the content understanding client
        response = content_understanding_client.begin_create_analyzer(
            analyzer_id=analyzer_id,
            analyzer_template_path=template_path
        )
        result = content_understanding_client.poll_result(response)
        print(f"Successfully created analyzer: {analyzer_id}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to create analyzer: {analyzer_id}")
        print(f"Error: {e}")

```

## Content and field extraction

**Content extraction** is the first step in the RAG implementation process. It transforms raw multimodal data into structured, searchable formats. This foundational step ensures that the content is organized and ready for indexing and retrieval. While content extraction provides the baseline for indexing and retrieval, it may not fully address domain-specific needs or provide deeper contextual insights.
[Learn more]() about content extraction capabilities for each modality.

**Field extraction** builds on content extraction by using AI to generate further metadata that enriches the knowledge base. This step allows you to define custom fields tailored to your specific use case, enabling more precise retrieval and enhanced search relevance. Field extraction complements content extraction by adding depth and context, making the data more actionable for RAG scenarios.
[Learn more]() about field extraction capabilities for each modality.

With the analyzers created for each modality, we can now process files to extract structured content and AI-generated metadata based on the defined schemas. This section demonstrates how to use the analyzers to analyze multimodal data and provides a sample of the results returned by the APIs. These results showcase the transformation of raw data into actionable insights, forming the foundation for indexing, retrieval, and RAG workflows.

#### Analyze files

``` python

#Iterate through each analyzer created and analyze content for each modality

analyzer_results =[]
extracted_markdown = []
analyzer_content = []
for analyzer in analyzer_configs:
    analyzer_id = analyzer["id"]
    template_path = analyzer["template_path"]
    file_location = analyzer["location"]
    try:
           # Analyze content
            response = content_understanding_client.begin_analyze(analyzer_id, file_location)
            result = content_understanding_client.poll_result(response)
            analyzer_results.append({"id":analyzer_id, "result": result["result"]})
            analyzer_content.append({"id": analyzer_id, "content": result["result"]["contents"]})

    except Exception as e:
            print(e)
            print("Error in creating analyzer. Please double-check your analysis settings.\nIf there is a conflict, you can delete the analyzer and then recreate it, or move to the next cell and use the existing analyzer.")

print("Analyzer Results:")
for analyzer_result in analyzer_results:
    print(f"Analyzer ID: {analyzer_result['id']}")
    print(json.dumps(analyzer_result["result"], indent=2))

# Delete the analyzer if it is no longer needed
#content_understanding_client.delete_analyzer(ANALYZER_ID)
```

### Extraction Results

The following code samples demonstrate the output of content and field extraction using Azure AI Content Understanding. The JSON response contains multiple fields, each serving a specific purpose in representing the extracted data.

- **Markdown Field**: The `markdown` field provides a simplified, human-readable representation of the extracted content. It's especially useful for quick previews or for integrating the extracted data into applications that require structured text, such as knowledge bases or search interfaces. For example, with a document, the `markdown` field might include headers, paragraphs, and other structural elements formatted for easy readability.

- **JSON Output**: The full JSON output provides a comprehensive representation of the extracted data, including both the content and the metadata generated during the extraction process including the following properties:

  - **Fields:** AI-generated metadata such as summaries, key topics, or classifications, tailored to the specific schema defined in the analyzer.
  - **Confidence Scores:** Indicators of the reliability of the extracted data.
  - **Spans:** Information about the location of the extracted content within the source file.
  - **Additional Metadata:** Details such as page numbers, dimensions, and other contextual information.

## Preprocessing output from Content Understanding

Once the data is extracted using Azure AI Content Understanding, the next step is to prepare the analysis output for embedding within a search system. Preprocessing the output ensures that the extracted content is transformed into a format suitable for indexing and retrieval. This step involves converting the JSON output from the analyzers into structured strings, preserving both the content and metadata for seamless integration into downstream workflows.

The following example demonstrates how to preprocess the output data from the analyzers, including documents, images, audio, and video. The process of converting each JSON output into a structured string lays the groundwork for embedding the data into a vector-based search system, enabling efficient retrieval and enhanced RAG workflows.

---

``` python

def convert_values_to_strings(json_obj):
    return [str(value) for value in json_obj]

#process all content and convert to string
def process_allJSON_content(all_content):

    # Initialize empty list to store string of all content
    output = []

    document_splits = [
        "This is a json string representing a document with text and metadata for the file located in "+str(analyzer_configs[0]["location"])+" "
        + v
        + "```"
        for v in convert_values_to_strings(all_content[0]["content"])
    ]
    docs = [Document(page_content=v) for v in document_splits]
    output += docs

    #convert image json object to string and append file metadata to the string
    image_splits = [
       "This is a json string representing an image verbalization and OCR extraction for the file located in "+str(analyzer_configs[1]["location"])+" "
       + v
       + "```"
       for v in convert_values_to_strings(all_content[1]["content"])
    ]
    image = [Document(page_content=v) for v in image_splits]
    output+=image

    #convert audio json object to string and append file metadata to the string
    audio_splits = [
        "This is a json string representing an audio segment with transcription for the file located in "+str(analyzer_configs[2]["location"])+" "
       + v
       + "```"
       for v in convert_values_to_strings(all_content[2]["content"])
    ]
    audio = [Document(page_content=v) for v in audio_splits]
    output += audio

    #convert video json object to string and append file metadata to the string
    video_splits = [
        "The following is a json string representing a video segment with scene description and transcript for the file located in "+str(analyzer_configs[3]["location"])+" "
        + v
        + "```"
        for v in convert_values_to_strings(all_content[3]["content"])
    ]
    video = [Document(page_content=v) for v in video_splits]
    output+=video

    return output

all_splits = process_allJSON_content(analyzer_content)

print("There are " + str(len(all_splits)) + " documents.")
# Print the content of all doc splits
for doc in all_splits:
    print(f"doc content", doc.page_content)
```

## Embed and index extracted content

After preprocessing the extracted data from Azure AI Content Understanding is complete, the next step is to embed and index the content for efficient retrieval. This step involves transforming the structured strings into vector embeddings using an embedding model and storing them within an Azure AI Search system. By embedding the content, you enable semantic search capabilities, allowing the system to retrieve the most relevant information based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches. This step is critical for building a robust RAG solution, as it ensures that the extracted content is optimized for advanced search and retrieval workflows.


``` python
# Embed the splitted documents and insert into Azure Search vector store
def embed_and_index_chunks(docs):
    aoai_embeddings = AzureOpenAIEmbeddings(
        azure_deployment=AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
        openai_api_version=AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_API_VERSION,  # e.g., "2023-12-01-preview"
        azure_endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
        azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider
    )

    vector_store: AzureSearch = AzureSearch(
        azure_search_endpoint=AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT,
        azure_search_key=None,
        index_name=AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME,
        embedding_function=aoai_embeddings.embed_query
    )
    vector_store.add_documents(documents=docs)
    return vector_store


# embed and index the docs:
vector_store = embed_and_index_chunks(all_splits)
```
---

## Semantic chunk retrieval

With the extracted content embedded and indexed, the next step is to use the power of similarity and vector search to retrieve the most relevant chunks of information. This section demonstrates how to execute both similarity and hybrid searches, enabling the system to surface content based on semantic meaning rather than exact keyword matches. By retrieving contextually relevant chunks, you can enhance the precision of your RAG workflows and provide more accurate, meaningful responses to user queries.

``` python
# Set your query
query = "japan"

# Perform a similarity search
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query=query,
    k=3,
    search_type="similarity",
)
for doc in docs:
    print(doc.page_content)

# Perform a hybrid search using the search_type parameter
docs = vector_store.hybrid_search(query=query, k=3)
for doc in docs:
    print(doc.page_content)

```

## Use OpenAI to interact with data

With the extracted content embedded and indexed, the final step in building a robust RAG solution is enabling conversational interactions using OpenAI chat models. This section demonstrates how to query your indexed data and apply OpenAI chat models to provide concise, contextually rich answers. By integrating conversational AI, you can transform your RAG solution into an interactive system that delivers meaningful insights and enhances user engagement. The following examples guide you through setting up a retrieval-augmented conversational flow, ensuring seamless integration between your data and OpenAI chat models.

---

```python
# Setup rag chain
prompt_str = """You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.
Question: {question}
Context: {context}
Answer:"""


def setup_rag_chain(vector_store):
    retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", k=3)

    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_str)
    llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
        openai_api_version=AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_API_VERSION,
        azure_deployment=AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
        azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    def format_docs(docs):
        return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)

    rag_chain = (
        {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
        | prompt
        | llm
        | StrOutputParser()
    )
    return rag_chain


# Setup conversational search
def conversational_search(rag_chain, query):
    print(rag_chain.invoke(query))


rag_chain = setup_rag_chain(vector_store)
while True:
    query = input("Enter your query: ")
    if query=="":
        break
    conversational_search(rag_chain, query)
```
