Content Understanding serves as a cornerstone for Media Asset Management solutions, enabling the following capabilities for audio files:
  
### Content extraction

* **Transcription**. Converts conversational audio into searchable and analyzable text-based transcripts in WebVTT format. Customizable fields can be generated from transcription data. Sentence-level and word-level timestamps are available upon request.

* **`Diarization`**. Distinguishes between speakers in a conversation, attributing parts of the transcript to specific speakers.

* **Speaker role detection**. Identifies agent and customer roles within contact center call data.

* **Language detection**. Automatically detects the language in the audio or uses specified language/locale hints.

### Field extraction

Field extraction allows you to extract structured data from audio files, such as summaries, sentiments, and mentioned entities from call logs. You can begin by customizing a suggested analyzer template or creating one from scratch.

## Key Benefits
Content Understanding offers advanced audio capabilities, including:

* **Customizable data extraction**. Tailor the output to your specific needs by modifying the field schema, allowing for precise data generation and extraction.

* **Generative models**. Utilize generative AI models to specify in natural language the content you want to extract, and the service generates the desired output.

* **Integrated pre-processing**. Benefit from built-in preprocessing steps like transcription, diarization, and role detection, providing rich context for generative models.

* **Scenario adaptability**. Adapt the service to your requirements by generating custom fields and extract relevant data.

## Content Understanding audio analyzer templates

Content Understanding offers customizable audio analyzer templates:

* **Post-call analysis**. Analyze call recordings to generate conversation transcripts, call summaries, sentiment assessments, and more.

* **Conversation analysis**. Generate transcriptions, summaries, and sentiment assessments from conversation audio recordings.
