# Document analysis: Markdown representation

Azure AI Content Understanding converts unstructured documents into [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm), while maintaining content and layout for accurate downstream use. This document describes how each content and layout element is represented in markdown.

## Words and selection marks

Recognized words and detected selection marks are represented in markdown as plain text. Selection marks are encoded using the Unicode characters `☒` (selected) and `☐` (unselected). Content might be escaped to avoid ambiguity with markdown formatting syntax.

## Barcodes

Barcodes are represented as markdown images with alt text and title: `![alt text](url "title")`.

| Content Type | Markdown Pattern | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Barcode | `![{barcode.kind}]({barcode.path} "{barcode.value}")` | `![QRCode](barcodes/1.2 "https://www.microsoft.com")` |

## Formulas

Mathematical formulas are encoded using LaTeX in Markdown:

* Inline formulas are enclosed in single dollar signs (`$...$`) to maintain text flow.
* Display formulas use double dollar signs (`$$...$$`) for standalone display.
* Multi-line formulas are represented as consecutive display formulas without intervening empty lines, preserving mathematical relationships.

| Formula Kind | Markdown | Visualization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inline | `$\sqrt { -1 } $ is $i$` | $\sqrt { -1 } $ is $i$
| Display | `$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$` | $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ |
| Multi-line | `$$( x + 2 ) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + 4 x + 4$$`<br/>`$$= x ( x + 4 ) + 4$$` | $$( x + 2 ) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + 4 x + 4$$ $$= x ( x + 4 ) + 4$$ |

## Images

Detected images, including figures and charts, are currently represented using HTML `<figure>` elements in markdown that wrap the detected text in the image. Any caption is represented via an `<figcaption>` elements. Any associated footnotes appear as text immediately after the figure.

``` md
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 2: Example</figcaption>

Values

200
100

</figure>

This is a footnote.
```

## Lines and paragraph

Paragraphs are represented in markdown as a block of text separate by blank lines.
When lines are available, each document line maps to a separate line in the markdown.

## Sections

Paragraphs with title or section heading role are converted into markdown headings. Title, if any, is assigned heading level 1. The heading levels of all other sections are assigned to preserve the detected hierarchical structure.

## Tables

Tables are currently represented in markdown using HTML table markup (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`) to enable support for merged cells via `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes and rich headers via `<th>`. Any caption is represented via an `<caption>` element. Any associated footnotes appear as text immediately after the table.

:::row:::
:::column:::

``` md
<table>
<caption>Table 1. Example</caption>
<tr><th>Header A</th><th>Header B</th></tr>
<tr><td>Cell 1A</td><td>Cell 1B</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cell 2A</td><td>Cell 2B</td></tr>
</table>
This is a footnote.
```

:::column-end:::
:::column:::

```md
<table>
<caption>Table 1. Example</caption>
<tr><th>Header A</th><th>Header B</th></tr>
<tr><td>Cell 1A</td><td>Cell 1B</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cell 2A</td><td>Cell 2B</td></tr>
</table>
This is a footnote.
```
:::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Page metadata

Markdown doesn't natively encode page metadata, such as page numbers, headers, footers, and breaks.
Since this information might be useful for downstream applications, we encode such metadata as HTML comments.

| Metadata | Markdown |
| --- | --- |
| Page number | `<!-- PageNumber="1" -->` |
| Page header | `<!-- PageHeader="Header" -->` |
| Page footer | `<!-- PageNumber="Footer" -->` |
| Page break | `<!-- PageBreak -->` |

## Conclusion

Content Understanding's Markdown elements provide a powerful way to represent the structure and content of analyzed documents. By understanding and properly utilizing these Markdown elements, you can enhance your document processing workflows and build more sophisticated content extraction applications.
