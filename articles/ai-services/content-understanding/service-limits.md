   > The file size limit is 200 MB and the duration limit is 30 minutes if the video file is included directly in the analysis request.

## Field schema limits

Content Understanding supports both basic field value types and nested structures, including lists, groups, tables, and fixed tables.

* **Basic field value types**: *string*, *date*, *time*, *number*, *integer*, and *boolean*.
* **List field**: A sequence of values of the same type, represented as an array of basic fields in the API.
* **Group field**: A set of semantically related fields, represented as an object of basic fields in the API.
* **Table field**: A variable number of items with fixed subfields, represented as an array of objects of basic fields in the API.
* **Fixed table field**: A group of fields with shared subfields, represented as an object of objects of basic fields in the API.

The following limits apply as of version 2024-12-01-preview.

### Basic limits

| Property | Document | Image | Text | Audio | Video |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Max fields | 50 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Max classify field categories | 300 | 300 | 300 | 300 | 300 |
| Supported generation methods | extract | generate<br>classify | generate<br>classify | generate<br>classify | generate<br>classify |

* The *Max fields* limit includes all named fields. For example, a list of strings counts as one field, while a group with string and number subfields counts as three fields. To extract beyond default limits, contact us at cu_contact@microsoft.com.
* The *Max classify field categories* limit is the total number of categories across all fields using the `classify` generation method.
* The generation method currently applies only to basic fields.

### Field type limits

| Field type | Document | Image | Text | Audio | Video |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic | No *boolean* | No *date*, *time* | *string* | *string* | No *date*, *time* |
| List | N/A | No *date*, *time* | *string* | *string* | No *date*, *time* |
| Group | N/A | No *date*, *time* | N/A | N/A | No *date*, *time* |
| Table | No *boolean* | No *date*, *time* | *string* | *string* | No *date*, *time* |
| Fixed table | No *boolean* | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Classification fields

Classification fields can be defined to return either a single category (single-label classification) or multiple categories (multi-label classification).

* **Single-label classification**: Defined using a string field with the `classify` method. It can be a top-level basic field or a subfield within a group or table.
* **Multi-label classification**: Represented as a list of string fields with the `classify` method. In the [REST API](/rest/api/contentunderstanding/operation-groups?view=rest-contentunderstanding-2024-12-01-preview&preserve-view=true), `method=classify` and `enum` are specified on the inner string field and can only be a top-level field.

*Note: Document analyzers currently don't support classification fields.*
