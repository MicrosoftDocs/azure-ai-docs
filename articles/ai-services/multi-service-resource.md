# Quickstart: Create your first AI Foundry resource

Learn how to create and manage an AI Foundry resource. It is the primary resource type for designing, deploying, and managing generative AI applications and agents. It provides access to agent service, models that are hosted using a serverless hosting model, evaluations and Azure OpenAI service. This is the recommended resource type for most applications built in Azure AI Foundry. 

Azure AI Foundry is the next version and renaming of former 'Azure AI Services'. All its previous capabilities are supported including Azure AI Services models for Speech, Vision, Language capabilities. New capabilities include AI Foundry API which lets you access Agent service and Evaluations, [projects](../ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects.md) as folders to organize your work, and [connections](../ai-foundry/how-to/connections-add.md) to integrate with other Azure services.

## Default project

In AI Foundry, projects provide access to developer APIs, and act as folders to organize your work. A default project is created for you when you create your resource in Azure portal or Azure AI Foundry Portal. The default project has a special notion - it provides backwards compatibility with developer APIs that are supported on the parent resource level. Typically these are AI Services and Azure OpenAI APIs for model customization. Newer APIs including Agents and Evaluations are accessible from any project. For more information, see [Types of projects](../ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#project-types).

Your AI Foundry resource might or might not be associated with an AI Foundry project:
- If your AI Foundry resources was created using Azure CLI, PowerShell, Bicep template, Terraform, or SDKs. In those cases, the AI Foundry resource by default isn't associated with a project. You can create a project later as a child resource.
- If your AI Foundry resource was created as a connection. For example, when you try to deploy a model that is not available in the region of your current AI Foundry resource. 
- A [project can be created in the Azure AI Foundry portal](../ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects.md) and automatically associated as a dependent of a new AI Foundry resource. 
- An AI Foundry resource might have been created in the AI Foundry portal, but as a dependent resource of an [Azure AI Foundry hub](../ai-foundry/concepts/ai-resources.md). In this case, the resource is automatically associated with the project you create in the hub. 

## Supported services with an AI Foundry resource

The AI Foundry resource enables access to the following Azure AI services with a single set of credentials. Some services are available via the AI Foundry resource and single-service resource.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend whenever possible to use the **AI Foundry** resource (where the API kind is `AIServices`) to access multiple Azure AI services with a single set of credentials. For services not available via the AI Foundry resource (such as Face and Custom Vision), you can alternatively create a single-service resource.

## Azure AI multi-services resource for Azure AI Search skills

Azure AI Search skills don't support the AI Foundry resource as described previously in this article. You must create a different kind of multi-service resource for Azure AI Search skills. 

The multi-service resource that you can use with Azure AI Search skills is listed under **AI Foundry** > **Classic AI services** > **Azure AI services multi-service account (classic)** in the portal. Look for the logo as shown here:

:::image type="content" source="./media/cognitive-services-resource-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure AI services multi-service account in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/cognitive-services-resource-portal.png":::

To create a multi-service resource for Azure AI Search follow these instructions:
1. Select this link to create an **Azure AI services multi-service account (classic)** resource: [https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne)

1. On the **Create** page, provide the following information:

    |Project details| Description   |
    |--|--|
    | **Subscription** | Select one of your available Azure subscriptions. |
    | **Resource group** | The Azure resource group that will contain your Azure AI services multi-service account resource. You can create a new group or add it to a preexisting group. |
    | **Region** | The location of your Azure AI services multi-service account instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. |
    | **Name** | A descriptive name for your Azure AI services multi-service account resource. For example, *MyCognitiveServicesResource*. |
    | **Pricing tier** | The cost of your Azure AI services multi-service account depends on the options you choose and your usage. For more information, see the API [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/). |

1. Configure other settings for your resource as needed, read and accept the conditions (as applicable), and then select **Review + create**.

> [!TIP]
> If your subscription doesn't allow you to create an AI Foundry resource, you might need to enable the privilege of that [Azure resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) using the [Azure portal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-portal), [PowerShell command](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-powershell) or an [Azure CLI command](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-cli). If you are not the subscription owner, ask someone with the role of *Owner* or *Admin* to complete the registration for you or ask for the **/register/action** privileges to be granted to your account.
