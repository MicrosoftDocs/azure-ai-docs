# Quickstart: Create an Azure AI services resource

Learn how to create and manage an Azure AI services resource. An Azure AI services resource allows you to access multiple Azure AI services with a single set of credentials. 

You can access Azure AI services through two different resource kinds: 

* Azure AI services multi-service resource:
    * Access multiple Azure AI services with a single set of credentials.
    * Consolidates billing from the services you use.
* Single-service resource such as Face and Vision:
    * Access a single Azure AI service with a unique set of credentials for each service created. 
    * Most Azure AI services offer a free tier to try it out.

Azure AI services are Azure [resources](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resources-portal) that you create under your Azure subscription. After you create a resource, you can use the keys and endpoint generated to authenticate your applications.

## Supported services with a multi-service resource

The multi-service resource enables access to the following Azure AI services with a single set of credentials. Some services are available via the multi-service resource and single-service resource.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend whenever possible to use the **Azure AI services** resource (where the API kind is `AIServices`) to access multiple Azure AI services with a single set of credentials. For services not available via the multi-service resource (such as Face and Custom Vision), you can create a single-service resource.
