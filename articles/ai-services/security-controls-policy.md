# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure AI services

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance) provides Microsoft-created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the **compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure AI services. You can assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources compliant with the specific standard.
