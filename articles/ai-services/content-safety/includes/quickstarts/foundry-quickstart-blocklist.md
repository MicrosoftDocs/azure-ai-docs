## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=ai-services). 
- An [Azure AI resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ProjectOxford/CognitiveServicesHub/~/AIServices). 


## Setup

Follow these steps to use the Content Safety **try it out** page: 

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) and navigate to your project/hub. Then select the **Guardrails + controls** tab on the left nav and select the **Try it out** tab.
1. On the **Try it out** page, you can experiment with various Guardrails & controls features such as text and image content, using adjustable thresholds to filter for inappropriate or harmful content.

### Use a blocklist 

The **Use blocklist** tab lets you create, edit, and add a blocklist to the moderation workflow. If you have a blocklist enabled when you run the test, you get a **Blocklist detection** panel under **Results**. It reports any matches with the blocklist.
