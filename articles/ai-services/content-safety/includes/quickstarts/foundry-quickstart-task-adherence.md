## Prerequisites 

- An Azure account. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- An [Azure AI resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ProjectOxford/CognitiveServicesHub/~/AIServices). 


## Use task adherence

Follow these steps to use task adherence on the Content Safety **try it out** page: 

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry (classic)](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) and navigate to your project/hub. Then select the **Guardrails + controls** tab on the left nav and select the **Try it out** tab.
1. On the **Try it out** page, you can experiment with various Guardrails & controls features such as text and image content, using adjustable thresholds to filter for inappropriate or harmful content.
1. Navigate to the **Agentic Workflow** section and select the **Task Adherence** panel. 
1. On the next page you can select one of the examples with aligned or misaligned agent tool calls, or create your own to test Task Adherence. 
1. Select **Run test**. Task Adherence returns the risk flag for each sample, and if a risk is detected, it returns a reason.
