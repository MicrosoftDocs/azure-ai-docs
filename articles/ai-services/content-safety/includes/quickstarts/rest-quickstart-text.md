## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) 
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://aka.ms/acs-create"  title="Create a Content Safety resource"  target="_blank">create a Content Safety resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Enter a unique name for your resource, select your subscription, and select a resource group, supported region (see [Region availability](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview#region-availability)), and supported pricing tier. Then select **Create**.
  * The resource takes a few minutes to deploy. After it finishes, Select **go to resource**. In the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **Subscription Key and Endpoint**. The endpoint and either of the keys are used to call APIs.
* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) installed

## Analyze text content

The following section walks through a sample request with cURL. Paste the command below into a text editor, and make the following changes.

1. Replace `<endpoint>` with the endpoint URL associated with your resource.
1. Replace `<your_subscription_key>` with one of the keys that come with your resource.
1. Optionally, replace the `"text"` field in the body with your own text you'd like to analyze.
    > [!TIP]
    > Text size and granularity
    >
    > See [Input requirements](../../overview.md#input-requirements) for maximum text length limitations.

```shell
curl --location --request POST '<endpoint>/contentsafety/text:analyze?api-version=2024-09-01' \
--header 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your_subscription_key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "text": "I hate you",
  "categories": ["Hate", "Sexual", "SelfHarm", "Violence"],
  "blocklistNames": ["string"],
  "haltOnBlocklistHit": true,
  "outputType": "FourSeverityLevels"
}'
```

The below fields must be included in the url:

| Name      |Required  |  Description | Type   |
| :------- |-------- |:--------------- | ------ |
| **API Version** |Required |This is the API version to be checked. The current version is: api-version=2024-09-01. Example: `<endpoint>/contentsafety/text:analyze?api-version=2024-09-01` | String |

The parameters in the request body are defined in this table:

| Name        | Required     | Description  | Type    |
| :---------- | ----------- | :------------ | ------- |
| **text**    | Required | This is the raw text to be checked. Other non-ascii characters can be included. | String  |
| **categories** | Optional | This is assumed to be an array of category names. See the [Harm categories guide](../../concepts/harm-categories.md) for a list of available category names. If no categories are specified, all four categories are used. We use multiple categories to get scores in a single request. | String  |
| **blocklistNames**    | Optional | Text blocklist Name. Only support following characters:  `0-9 A-Z a-z - . _ ~`. You could attach multiple list names here. | Array   |
| **haltOnBlocklistHit** | Optional | When set to `true`, further analyses of harmful content won't be performed in cases where blocklists are hit. When set to `false`, all analyses of harmful content will be performed, whether or not blocklists are hit. | Boolean|
| **outputType** | Optional | `"FourSeverityLevels"` or `"EightSeverityLevels"`. Output severities in four or eight levels, the value can be `0,2,4,6` or `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`. | String|

See the following sample request body:

```json
{
  "text": "I hate you",
  "categories": ["Hate", "Sexual", "SelfHarm", "Violence"],
  "blocklistNames": ["array"],
  "haltOnBlocklistHit": false,
  "outputType": "FourSeverityLevels"
}
```

Open a command prompt window, paste in the edited cURL command, and run it.


## Output

You should see the text moderation results displayed as JSON data in the console output. For example:

```json
{
  "blocklistsMatch": [
    {
      "blocklistName": "string",
      "blocklistItemId": "string",
      "blocklistItemText": "string"
    }
  ],
  "categoriesAnalysis": [
    {
      "category": "Hate",
      "severity": 2
    },
    {
      "category": "SelfHarm",
      "severity": 0
    },
    {
      "category": "Sexual",
      "severity": 0
    },
    {
      "category": "Violence",
      "severity": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

The JSON fields in the output are defined here:

| Name     | Description   | Type   |
| :------------- | :--------------- | ------ |
| **categoriesAnalysis**   | Each output class that the API predicts. Classification can be multi-labeled. For example, when a text sample is run through the text moderation model, it could be classified as both sexual content and violence. [Harm categories](../../concepts/harm-categories.md)| String |
| **Severity** | The higher the severity of input content, the larger this value is. 	  | Integer |
