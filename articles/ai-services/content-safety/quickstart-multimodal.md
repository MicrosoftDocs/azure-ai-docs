# Quickstart: Analyze multimodal content (preview) 

The Multimodal API analyzes materials containing both image content and text content to help make applications and services safer from harmful user-generated or AI-generated content. Analyzing an image and its associated text content together can preserve context and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the content.

For more information on how content is filtered, see the [Harm categories concept page](./concepts/harm-categories.md#multimodal-image-with-text-content). For API input limits, see the [Input requirements](./overview.md#input-requirements) section of the Overview. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available in certain Azure regions. See [Region availability](./overview.md#region-availability).
