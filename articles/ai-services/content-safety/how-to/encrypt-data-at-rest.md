When you enable customer managed keys this also enables a system-assigned managed identity, a feature of Microsoft Entra ID. Once the system-assigned managed identity is enabled, your resource is registered with Microsoft Entra ID. After being registered, the managed identity will be given access to the Key Vault selected during customer managed key setup.
