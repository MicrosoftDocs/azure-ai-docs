# Quickstart: Protected material detection for code (preview)

The Protected Material for Code feature provides a comprehensive solution for identifying AI outputs that match code from existing GitHub repositories. This feature allows you to use code generation models confidently, in a way that enhances transparency to end users and promotes compliance with organizational policies.

[!INCLUDE [content-safety-code-indexer](./includes/code-indexer.md)]

The key objectives of the Protected Material Detection for Code feature for AI-generated code are:

- To detect and prevent the display of protected code generated by AI models.
- To enable organizations to manage risks associated with AI-generated code.
- To ensure that AI-generated code complies with legal, ethical, and organizational policy standards.

For more information about protected material detection, see the [Protected material detection concept page](./concepts/protected-material.md). For API input limits, see the [Input requirements](./overview.md#input-requirements) section of the Overview.
