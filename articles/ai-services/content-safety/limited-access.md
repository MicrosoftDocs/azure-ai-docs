# Limited Access to Content Safety Features

The Azure AI Content Safety [disconnected containers](./how-to/containers/container-overview.md) and [embedded SDK](./how-to/embedded-content-safety.md) are Limited Access features available by registration only, and only for certain use cases. These features allow for on-device analysis where cloud connectivity is intermittent or unavailable.

## Registration process

The content safety disconnected containers and embedded SDK require registration. Only customers managed by Microsoft, meaning those who are working directly with Microsoft account teams, are eligible for access. Customers who wish to use this feature must register by submitting a registration form. The use of either feature is limited to the use case selected at the time of registration. Microsoft may require customers to re-verify this information.
