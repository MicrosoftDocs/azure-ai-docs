| Error Code    | Possible reasons   | Suggestions           |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| InvalidRequestBody  | One or more fields in the request body do not match the API definition. | Check the API version you specified in the API call. <br/>Check the corresponding API definition for the API version you selected. |
| InvalidResourceName | The resource name you specified in the URL does not meet the requirements, like the blocklist name, blocklist term ID, etc. | Check the API version you specified in the API call.  <br/>Check whether the given name has invalid characters according to the API definition. |

| InternalError       | Some unexpected situations on the server side have been triggered. | You may want to retry a few times after a small period and see it the issue happens again.  <br/>             Contact Azure Support if this issue persists. |
| ServerBusy          | The server side cannot process the request temporarily.      | You may want to retry a few times after a small period and see it the issue happens again.  <br/>Contact Azure Support if this issue persists. |
