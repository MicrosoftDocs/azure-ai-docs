# Protected material detection

The Protected material detection APIs scan the output of large language models to identify and flag known protected material. These APIs help organizations prevent the generation of content that closely matches copyrighted text or code.

The [Protected material text API](../quickstart-protected-material.md) flags any known text content that large language models output, such as song lyrics, articles, recipes, and selected web content.

The [Protected material code API](../quickstart-protected-material-code.md) flags protected code content that large language models might output. This content comes from known GitHub repositories and includes software libraries, source code, algorithms, and other proprietary programming content.
