# Quickstart: Use Prompt Shields

In this quickstart, you use the Prompt Shields feature. Prompt Shields in Azure AI Content Safety is designed to safeguard generative AI systems from generating harmful or inappropriate content. These filters detect and mitigate risks associated with both User Prompt Attacks (malicious or harmful user-generated inputs) and Document Attacks (inputs containing harmful content embedded within documents). The use of Prompt Shields is crucial in environments where GenAI is used, to ensure that AI outputs remain safe, compliant, and trustworthy.

The primary objectives of the Prompt Shields feature for GenAI applications are:

- To detect and block harmful or policy-violating user prompts that could lead to unsafe AI outputs.
- To identify and mitigate document attacks where harmful content is embedded within user-provided documents.
- To maintain the integrity, safety, and compliance of AI-generated content, preventing misuse of GenAI systems.

For more information on Prompt Shields, see the [Prompt Shields concept page](./concepts/jailbreak-detection.md). For API input limits, see the [Input requirements](./overview.md#input-requirements) section of the Overview.
