# Quickstart: Protected material detection for text

The Protected Material for Text feature provides a comprehensive solution for managing risks associated with AI-generated content (English content only). By detecting and preventing the display of protected material, organizations can ensure compliance with intellectual property laws, maintain content originality, and protect their reputations. Protected material refers to content that matches known text from copyrighted sources, such as song lyrics, articles, recipes, or other selected web content.

The key objectives of the Protected Material Detection for Text feature for AI-generated content are:

- To detect and prevent the display of protected content generated by AI models.
- To enable organizations to manage risks associated with AI-generated content.
- To ensure that AI-generated content complies with legal, ethical, and content policy guidelines.

For more information about protected material detection, see the [Protected material detection concept page](./concepts/protected-material.md). For API input limits, see the [Input requirements](./overview.md#input-requirements) section of the Overview.
