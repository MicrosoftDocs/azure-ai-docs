# What is voice conversion? (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](./includes/previews/preview-generic.md)]

Voice conversion is the process of transforming the voice characteristics of a given audio to a target voice speaker. After voice conversion, the resulting audio reserves source audio's linguistic content and prosody while the voice timbre sounds like the target speaker.

There are 3 reasons users need voice conversion functionality:

- Voice conversion can replicate your content using a different voice identity while maintaining the original prosody and emotion. For instance, in education, teachers can record themselves reading stories, and voice conversion can deliver these stories using a pre-designed cartoon character's voice. This method preserves the expressiveness of the teacher's reading while incorporating the unique timbre of the cartoon character's voice.
- Another application is multilingual dubbing. When localized content is read by different voices, voice conversion can transform them into a uniform voice, ensuring a consistent experience across all languages while keeping the most localized voice characters.
- Voice conversion enhances the control over the expressiveness of a voice. By transforming various speaking styles, such as adopting a unique tone or conveying exaggerated emotions, a voice gains greater versatility in expression and can be more dynamic in different scenarios.

## Key capabilities

Voice conversion (or voice changer or speech to speech conversion) is built on state-of-the-art generative models and offers high-quality voice conversion. It delivers the following core capabilities:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **High speaker similarity**   | Captures the timbre and vocal identity of the target speaker.<br>Generates audio that accurately matches the target voice. |
| **Prosody preservation**      | Maintains rhythm, stress, and intonation of source audio.<br>Preserves expressive and emotional qualities. |
| **High audio fidelity**       | Generates realistic, natural-sounding audio.<br>Minimizes artifacts.                                      |
| **Multilingual support**      | Enables multilingual voice conversion.<br>Supports 91 locales (same as standard text to speech locale support).<br>See [supported voices for voice conversion](./language-support.md?tabs=tts#voice-conversion) for the complete list. |

## Use voice conversion

You can use Azure AI Speech voice conversion with either the Speech SDK or text to speech REST APIs.

Use the `<mstts:voiceconversion>` tag via Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) to specify the source audio URL and the target voice for the conversion. For a complete list of supported target voices, see [supported voices for voice conversion](./language-support.md?tabs=tts#voice-conversion).

### Example SSML

```xml
<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="https://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xml:lang="en-US">
    <voice xml:lang="en-US" xml:gender="Female" name="en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural">
        <mstts:voiceconversion url="https://your.blob.core.windows.net/sourceaudio.wav"/>
    </voice>
</speak>
```

For details about the SSML structure and usage, see the [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) reference](./speech-synthesis-markup-voice.md#voice-conversion-element) documentation.
