# What is the Speech SDK?

The Speech SDK (software development kit) exposes many of the [Speech service capabilities](overview.md), so you can develop speech-enabled applications. The Speech SDK is available [in many programming languages](quickstarts/setup-platform.md) and across platforms. The Speech SDK is ideal for both real-time and non-real-time scenarios, by using local devices, files, Azure Blob Storage, and input and output streams.

In some cases, you can't or shouldn't use the [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md). In those cases, you can use REST APIs to access the Speech service. For example, use the [Speech to text REST API](rest-speech-to-text.md) for [batch transcription](batch-transcription.md) and [custom speech](custom-speech-overview.md) model management.

## Supported languages

The Speech SDK supports the following languages and platforms:

| Programming language | Reference | Platform support |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| [C#](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) <sup>1</sup> | [.NET](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech) | Windows, Linux, macOS, Mono, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac, Xamarin.Android, UWP, Unity |
| [C++](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-cpp) <sup>2</sup> | [C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/) | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| [Go](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-go) | [Go](https://github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go) | Linux | 
| [Java](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-java) | [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech) | Android, Windows, Linux, macOS |
| [JavaScript](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript) | [JavaScript](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/) | Browser, Node.js |
| [Objective-C](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-objectivec) | [Objective-C](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/) | iOS, macOS |
| [Python](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-python) | [Python](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/) | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| [Swift](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-swift) | [Objective-C](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/) <sup>3</sup> | iOS, macOS |

<sup>1 C# code samples are available in the documentation. The Speech SDK for C# is based on .NET Standard 2.0, so it supports many platforms and programming languages. For more information, see [.NET implementation support](/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support).</sup>  
<sup>2 C isn't a supported programming language for the Speech SDK.</sup>  
<sup>3 The Speech SDK for Swift shares client libraries and reference documentation with the Speech SDK for Objective-C.</sup>

## Speech SDK demo

The following video shows how to install the [Speech SDK for C#](quickstarts/setup-platform.md) and write a .NET console application for speech to text.

## Code samples

Speech SDK code samples are available in the documentation and GitHub. 

### Docs samples

At the top of documentation pages that contain samples, options to select include C#, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Python, or Swift.

If a sample isn't available in your preferred programming language, you can select another programming language to get started and learn about the concepts, or see the reference and samples linked from the beginning of the article.

### GitHub samples

In depth samples are available in the [Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk](https://aka.ms/csspeech/samples) repository on GitHub. There are samples for C# (including UWP, Unity, and Xamarin), C++, Java, JavaScript (including Browser and Node.js), Objective-C, Python, and Swift. Code samples for Go are available in the [Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go](https://github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go) repository on GitHub.
