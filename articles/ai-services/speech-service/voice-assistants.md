# What is a voice assistant?

By using voice assistants with the Speech service, developers can create natural, human-like, conversational interfaces for their applications and experiences. The voice assistant service provides fast, reliable interaction between a device and an assistant implementation.

## Choose an assistant solution

The first step in creating a voice assistant is to decide what you want it to do. Speech service provides multiple, complementary solutions for crafting assistant interactions. You might want your application to support an open-ended conversation with phrases such as "I need to go to Seattle" or "What kind of pizza can I order?" For flexibility and versatility, you can add voice in and voice out capabilities to a bot by using Azure AI Bot Service with the [Direct Line Speech](direct-line-speech.md) channel. 

If you aren't yet sure what you want your assistant to do, we recommend [Direct Line Speech](direct-line-speech.md) as the best option. It offers integration with a rich set of tools and authoring aids, such as the [Virtual Assistant solution and enterprise template](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-enterprise-template-overview) and the [QnA Maker service](../qnamaker/overview/overview.md), to build on common patterns and use your existing knowledge sources.

## Core features

Whether you choose [Direct Line Speech](direct-line-speech.md) or another solution to create your assistant interactions, you can use a rich set of customization features to customize your assistant to your brand, product, and personality.

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
|[Custom keyword](./custom-keyword-basics.md) | Users can start conversations with assistants by using a custom keyword such as "Hey Contoso." An app does this with a custom keyword engine in the Speech SDK, which you can configure by going to [Get started with custom keywords](./custom-keyword-basics.md). Voice assistants can use service-side keyword verification to improve the accuracy of the keyword activation (versus using the device alone).
|[Speech to text](speech-to-text.md) | Voice assistants convert real-time audio into recognized text by using [speech to text](speech-to-text.md) from the Speech service. This text is available, as it's transcribed, to both your assistant implementation and your client application.
|[Text to speech](text-to-speech.md) | Textual responses from your assistant are synthesized through [text to speech](text-to-speech.md) from the Speech service. This synthesis is then made available to your client application as an audio stream. Microsoft offers the ability to build your own custom, high-quality Neural Text to speech (Neural TTS) voice that gives a voice to your brand.
