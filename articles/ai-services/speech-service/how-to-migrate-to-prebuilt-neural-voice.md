# Migrate from prebuilt standard voice to prebuilt neural voice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are retiring the standard voices from September 1, 2021 through August 31, 2024. Speech resources created after September 1, 2021 could never use standard voices. We are gradually sunsetting standard voice support for Speech resources created prior to September 1, 2021. By August 31, 2024 the standard voices won’t be available for all customers. You can choose from the supported [neural voice names](language-support.md?tabs=tts).
> 
> The pricing for prebuilt standard voice is different from prebuilt neural voice. Go to the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) and check the pricing details in the collapsable "Deprecated" section. Prebuilt standard voice (retired) is referred as **Standard**. 

The prebuilt neural voice provides more natural sounding speech output, and thus, a better end-user experience. 

|Prebuilt standard voice  | Prebuilt neural voice | 
|--|--|
| Noticeably robotic  | Natural sounding, closer to human-parity|
| Limited capabilities in voice tuning<sup>1</sup> |Advanced capabilities in voice tuning   |
| No new investment in future voice fonts  |On-going investment in future voice fonts |

<sup>1</sup> For voice tuning, volume and pitch changes can be applied to standard voices at the word or sentence-level, whereas they can only be applied to neural voices at the sentence level. Duration supports standard voices only. To learn more about details on prosody elements, see [Improve synthesis with SSML](speech-synthesis-markup.md).

## Action required

> [!TIP]
> Even without an Azure account, you can listen to voice samples at the [Voice Gallery](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery) and determine the right voice for your business needs.

1. Review the [price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) structure.
2. To make the change, [follow the sample code](speech-synthesis-markup-voice.md#use-voice-elements) to update the voice name in your speech synthesis request to the supported neural voice names in chosen languages. Use neural voices for your speech synthesis request, on cloud or on prem. For on-premises container, use the [neural voice containers](../cognitive-services-container-support.md) and follow the [instructions](speech-container-howto.md).

## Standard voice details (deprecated)

Read the following sections for details on standard voice.

### Language support

More than 75 prebuilt standard voices are available in over 45 languages and locales, which allow you to convert text into synthesized speech.

> [!NOTE]
> With two exceptions, standard voices are created from samples that use a 16 khz sample rate.
> **The en-US-AriaRUS** and **en-US-GuyRUS** voices are also created from samples that use a 24 khz sample rate.
> All voices can upsample or downsample to other sample rates when synthesizing.
