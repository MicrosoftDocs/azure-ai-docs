# What is video translation (preview) 

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](../includes/preview-feature.md)]

Video translation is a feature in Azure AI Speech that enables you to seamlessly translate and generate videos in multiple languages automatically. This feature is designed to help you localize your video content to cater to diverse audiences around the globe. You can efficiently create immersive, localized videos across various use cases such as vlogs, education, news, enterprise training, advertising, film, TV shows, and more.

The process of replacing the original language of a video with audio recorded in a different language is often relied upon to cater to diverse audiences. Traditionally achieved through human recording and manual post-production, translation is essential for ensuring that viewers can enjoy video content in their native language. However, this process comes with key pain points, including its high cost, lengthy duration, and inability to replicate the original speaker's voice accurately. Video translation in Azure AI Speech addresses these challenges by providing an automated, efficient, and cost-effective solution for creating localized videos.
