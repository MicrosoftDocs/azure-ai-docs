# What is video translation (preview) 

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](../includes/preview-feature.md)]

Video translation is a feature in Azure AI Speech that enables you to seamlessly translate and generate videos in multiple languages automatically. This feature is designed to help you localize your video content to cater to diverse audiences around the globe. You can efficiently create immersive, localized videos across various use cases such as vlogs, education, news, enterprise training, advertising, film, TV shows, and more.

The process of replacing the original language of a video with speech recorded in a different language is essential for catering to diverse audiences. This method, typically achieved through human recording and manual post-production, ensures that viewers can enjoy video content in their native language. However, it comes with key pain points:
- **High cost**: Traditional video translation methods often require expensive human voice actors and extensive post-production work, making it a costly endeavor for content creators.
- **Time-consuming**: The manual process of recording and editing translated speech can take a significant amount of time, delaying the release of localized content.
- **Inconsistent quality**: Human voice actors might not always accurately replicate the original speaker's voice, leading to a less immersive experience for viewers.

With video translation in Azure AI Speech, these challenges are effectively addressed. The feature automates the translation process, significantly reducing costs and production time while ensuring high-quality results. Accurately replicating the original speaker's voice creates a seamless and immersive viewing experience for audiences worldwide.
- **Cost-effective**: Reduces the need for expensive human voice actors and manual post-production work.

## How it works

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the workflow.

![Diagram of video translation API workflow.](./media/video-translation/video-translation-api-workflow.png)

1. You upload the video file that you want translated to Azure Blob Storage. 
1. You create a translation by specifying the URL of the video file. Include other parameters, such as the source and target languages, voice type, and whether to burn subtitles into the video. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > Creating a translation doesn't initiate the translation process. 
1. You can start translating the video by creating an iteration. An iteration is a specific instance of the translation process. You can create multiple iterations for the same translation, allowing you to experiment with different settings or parameters.
1. After the first iteration, you can use the subtitle file in subsequent iterations. Upload your own subtitle file or make changes to the auto-generated subtitle file and upload the modified subtitle file.
1. Periodically get the status of the translation and iteration. The status will indicate whether the translation is in progress, completed, or failed.
1. Once the translation is complete, you can download the translated video and subtitles. The translated video will have the original speech replaced with the translated speech, and the subtitles will be synchronized with the translated speech.
1. You can also delete the translation and iteration if you no longer need them. Deleting a translation will remove all associated iterations and data.
