# Customize a speech model with fine-tuning in the Azure AI Foundry portal

With custom speech, you can enhance speech recognition accuracy for your applications by using a custom model for real-time speech to text, speech translation, and batch transcription. The base model, trained with Microsoft-owned data, handles common spoken language well, but a custom model can improve domain-specific vocabulary and audio conditions by providing text and audio data for training. Additionally, you can train the model with structured text for custom pronunciations, display text formatting, and profanity filtering.

> [!TIP]
> You can bring your custom speech models from [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com) to the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com). In AI Foundry, you can pick up where you left off by connecting to your existing Speech resource. For more information about connecting to an existing Speech resource, see [Connect to an existing Speech resource](../../ai-studio/ai-services/how-to/connect-ai-services.md#connect-azure-ai-services-after-you-create-a-project).

In [AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com), you create a custom speech model by fine-tuning an Azure AI Speech base model with your own data. You can upload your data, test and train a custom model, compare accuracy between models, and deploy a model to a custom endpoint.

This article shows you how to use fine-tuning in AI Foundry to create a custom speech model. For more information about custom speech, see the [custom speech overview](./custom-speech-overview.md) documentation.

## Start fine-tuning a model with your data

In AI Foundry, you can fine-tune some Azure AI services models. For example, you can fine-tune a model for custom speech. Each custom model is specific to a [locale](language-support.md?tabs=stt). For example, you might fine-tune a model for English in the United States.

1. Go to your AI Foundry project. If you need to create a project, see [Create an AI Foundry project](../../ai-studio/how-to/create-projects.md).
1. Select **Fine-tuning** from the left pane.
1. Select **AI Service fine-tuning** > **+ Fine-tune**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../ai-studio/media/ai-services/fine-tune-azure-ai-services.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page to select fine-tuning of Azure AI Services models." lightbox="../../ai-studio/media/ai-services/fine-tune-azure-ai-services.png":::
 
1. In the wizard, select **Speech to text (speech recognition)** for custom speech. Then select **Next**.
1. Select the connected service resource that you want to use for fine-tuning. Then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-select-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page to select the connected service resource that you want to use for fine-tuning." lightbox="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-select-connection.png":::

    In this example, we can choose from the following options:
    - **AI Service**: The Azure AI Services multi-service resource that [came with the AI Foundry project](../../ai-studio/ai-services/how-to/connect-ai-services.md#connect-azure-ai-services-when-you-create-a-project-for-the-first-time).
    - **Speech Service**: An Azure AI Speech resource that was [connected after the project was created](../../ai-studio/ai-services/how-to/connect-ai-services.md#connect-azure-ai-services-after-you-create-a-project). 

1. Enter a name and description for the fine-tuning job. Then select **Next**.
1. From the new left menu in the fine-tuning page, select **Manage data** and then select **Add data**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-add-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page with an option to add data to the custom speech project." lightbox="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-add-data.png":::

1. In the **Add data** wizard, select the type of training data you want to add. In this example, we select **Audio + human-labeled transcript**. Then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-add-data-select-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page with an option to select the type of training data you want to add." lightbox="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-add-data-select-type.png":::

1. On the **Upload your data** page, select local files, Azure Blob Storage, or other shared web locations. Then select **Next**.
1. Enter a name and description for the data. Then select **Next**.
1. Review the data and select **Upload**. You're taken back to the **Manage data** page. The status of the data is **Processing**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-add-data-status-processing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page that shows the status of the data as processing." lightbox="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-add-data-status-processing.png":::

## Train a custom model from your data

1. After the data is processed, select **Train model** from the left menu. Then select **+ Train model**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-train-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page with an option to start training for a custom speech model." lightbox="./media/ai-studio/custom-speech/new-fine-tune-train-model.png":::
