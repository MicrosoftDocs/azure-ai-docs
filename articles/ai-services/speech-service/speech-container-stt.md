# Speech to text containers with Docker

The Speech to text container transcribes real-time speech or batch audio recordings with intermediate results. In this article, you learn how to download, install, and run a speech to text container.

For more information about prerequisites, validating that a container is running, running multiple containers on the same host, and running disconnected containers, see [Install and run Speech containers with Docker](speech-container-howto.md).

## Container images

The Speech to text container image for all supported versions and locales can be found on the [Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text/tags) syndicate. It resides within the `azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/` repository and is named `speech-to-text`. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/containers/mcr-tags-speech-to-text.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the search connectors and triggers dialog." lightbox="./media/containers/mcr-tags-speech-to-text.png":::

The fully qualified container image name is, `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text`. Either append a specific version or append `:latest` to get the most recent version.

| Version | Path |
|-----------|------------|
| Latest | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text:latest`<br/><br/>The `latest` tag pulls the latest image for the `en-US` locale. |
| 4.10.0 | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text:4.10.0-amd64-mr-in` |

All tags, except for `latest`, are in the following format and are case sensitive:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<platform>-<locale>-<prerelease>
```

The tags are also available [in JSON format](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text/tags/list) for your convenience. The body includes the container path and list of tags. The tags aren't sorted by version, but `"latest"` is always included at the end of the list as shown in this snippet:

```json
{
  "name": "azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text",
  "tags": [
    <--redacted for brevity-->    
    "4.10.0-amd64-sw-tz",
    "4.10.0-amd64-ta-in",
    "4.10.0-amd64-th-th",
    "4.10.0-amd64-tr-tr",
    "4.10.0-amd64-vi-vn",
    "4.10.0-amd64-wuu-cn",
    "4.10.0-amd64-yue-cn",
    "4.10.0-amd64-zh-cn",
    "4.10.0-amd64-zh-cn-sichuan",
    "4.10.0-amd64-zh-hk",
    "4.10.0-amd64-zh-tw",
    "4.10.0-amd64-zu-za",
    "latest"
  ]
}
```

## Get the container image with docker pull

You need the [prerequisites](speech-container-howto.md#prerequisites) including required hardware. Also see the [recommended allocation of resources](speech-container-howto.md#container-requirements-and-recommendations) for each Speech container. 

Use the [docker pull](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) command to download a container image from Microsoft Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text:latest
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `latest` tag pulls the latest image for the `en-US` locale. For additional versions and locales, see [speech to text container images](#container-images).

## Run the container with docker run

Use the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command to run the container. 

# [Speech to text](#tab/container)

The following table represents the various `docker run` parameters and their corresponding descriptions:

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|---------|
| `{ENDPOINT_URI}` | The endpoint is required for metering and billing. For more information, see [billing arguments](speech-container-howto.md#billing-arguments). |
| `{API_KEY}` | The API key is required. For more information, see [billing arguments](speech-container-howto.md#billing-arguments). |

When you run the speech to text container, configure the port, memory, and CPU according to the speech to text container [requirements and recommendations](speech-container-howto.md#container-requirements-and-recommendations).

Here's an example `docker run` command with placeholder values. You must specify the `ENDPOINT_URI` and `API_KEY` values:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 8g --cpus 4 \
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

This command:
* Runs a `speech-to-text` container from the container image.
* Allocates 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory.
* Exposes TCP port 5000 and allocates a pseudo-TTY for the container.
* Automatically removes the container after it exits. The container image is still available on the host computer.

# [Disconnected speech to text](#tab/disconnected)

To run disconnected containers (not connected to the internet), you must submit [this request form](https://aka.ms/csdisconnectedcontainers) and wait for approval. For more information about applying and purchasing a commitment plan to use containers in disconnected environments, see [Use containers in disconnected environments](../containers/disconnected-containers.md) in the Azure AI services documentation.

If you're approved to run the container disconnected from the internet, the following example shows the formatting of the `docker run` command to use, with placeholder values. Replace these placeholder values with your own values.

The `DownloadLicense=True` parameter in your `docker run` command downloads a license file to enable your Docker container to run when it isn't connected to the internet. It also contains an expiration date, after which the license file is invalid to run the container. You can only use a license file with the appropriate container that you're approved for. For example, you can't use a license file for a `speech-to-text` container with a `neural-text-to-speech` container.

| Placeholder | Description | 
|-------------|-------|
| `{IMAGE}` | The container image you want to use.<br/><br/>For example: `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/speech-to-text:latest` |
| `{LICENSE_MOUNT}` | The path where the license is downloaded, and mounted.<br/><br/>For example: `/host/license:/path/to/license/directory` |
| `{ENDPOINT_URI}` | The endpoint for authenticating your service request. You can find it on your resource's **Key and endpoint** page, on the Azure portal.<br/><br/>For example: `https://<your-resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com` |
| `{API_KEY}` | The key for your Speech resource. You can find it on your resource's **Key and endpoint** page, on the Azure portal. |
| `{CONTAINER_LICENSE_DIRECTORY}` | Location of the license folder on the container's local filesystem.<br/><br/>For example: `/path/to/license/directory` |

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 \ 
-v {LICENSE_MOUNT} \
{IMAGE} \
eula=accept \
billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
apikey={API_KEY} \
DownloadLicense=True \
Mounts:License={CONTAINER_LICENSE_DIRECTORY} 
```

Once the license file is downloaded, you can run the container in a disconnected environment. The following example shows the formatting of the `docker run` command you use, with placeholder values. Replace these placeholder values with your own values.

Wherever the container is run, the license file must be mounted to the container and the location of the license folder on the container's local filesystem must be specified with `Mounts:License=`. An output mount must also be specified so that billing usage records can be written.

Placeholder | Value | Format or example |
|-------------|-------|---|
| `{IMAGE}` | The container image you want to use.<br/><br/>For example: `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/speech-to-text:latest` |
 `{MEMORY_SIZE}` | The appropriate size of memory to allocate for your container.<br/><br/>For example: `4g` |
| `{NUMBER_CPUS}` | The appropriate number of CPUs to allocate for your container.<br/><br/>For example: `4` |
| `{LICENSE_MOUNT}` | The path where the license is located and mounted.<br/><br/>For example: `/host/license:/path/to/license/directory` |
| `{OUTPUT_PATH}` | The output path for logging.<br/><br/>For example: `/host/output:/path/to/output/directory`<br/><br/>For more information, see [usage records](../containers/disconnected-containers.md#usage-records) in the Azure AI services documentation. |
| `{CONTAINER_LICENSE_DIRECTORY}` | Location of the license folder on the container's local filesystem.<br/><br/>For example: `/path/to/license/directory` |
| `{CONTAINER_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}` | Location of the output folder on the container's local filesystem.<br/><br/>For example: `/path/to/output/directory` |

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory {MEMORY_SIZE} --cpus {NUMBER_CPUS} \ 
-v {LICENSE_MOUNT} \ 
-v {OUTPUT_PATH} \
{IMAGE} \
eula=accept \
Mounts:License={CONTAINER_LICENSE_DIRECTORY}
Mounts:Output={CONTAINER_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}
```

Speech containers provide a default directory for writing the license file and billing log at runtime. The default directories are /license and /output respectively. 

When you're mounting these directories to the container with the `docker run -v` command, make sure the local machine directory is set ownership to `user:group nonroot:nonroot` before running the container.

Here's a sample command to set file/directory ownership.

```bash
sudo chown -R nonroot:nonroot <YOUR_LOCAL_MACHINE_PATH_1> <YOUR_LOCAL_MACHINE_PATH_2> ...
```
