    questions:
      - question: |
          What scenarios does Voice Live support?
        answer: |
          Voice Live API supports a wide range of real-time, natural voice interaction scenarios: contact centers, automotive assistants, accessibility applications, virtual tutors and learning companions, multilingual public service agents, HR support, and training. Used by customers like eClinicalWorks and the Government of Malta.
      - question: |
          How does Voice Live compare to AOAI Realtime API? When should I choose which?
        answer: |
          Voice Live API enhances AOAI Realtime API by offering: expanded model selection (including GPT-Realtime, GPT-5, GPT-4.1, PHI), more natural voice options, more supported speech languages, avatar integration, advanced semantic voice activity detection (VAD), seamless Microsoft Foundry Agent Service integration, telephony integration via Azure Communication Services.
      - question: |
          What regions does Voice Live support?
        answer: |
          Voice Live is available in 10+ Azure regions. For more information, see [Region support](./regions.md?tabs=voice-live).
      - question: |
          What is the tokens-per-minute threshold?
        answer: |
          The current limit is 100,000 tokens per minute per resource. Customers can request an increase. For more information, see [Speech service quotas and limits](./speech-services-quotas-and-limits.md).
  - name: Generative AI Models
    questions:
      - question: |
          What generative AI models are supported?
        answer: |
          Supports OpenAI models in Microsoft Foundry, Phi-based LLMs, and SLMs. For more information, see [Voice Live overview](./voice-live.md). Voice Live also provides an option to bring-your-own model (PREVIEW).
      - question: |
          How do I choose the LLM model for my use case?
        answer: |
          Consider: accuracy (Azure Speech-based models are more robust for noisy audio), existing LLM solutions (reuse prompts and grounding data), latency (text-based LLMs can have slightly higher latency), inference cost (smaller models can be more cost-effective).
      - question: |
          What is response instruction?
        answer: |
          Guides model behavior and context. Define agent personality, specify questions, control response formatting. Responses should be concise and normalized for optimal audio synthesis.
      - question: |
          What is response temperature?
        answer: |
          Controls randomness of output. Lower values = deterministic, higher = creative. Adjust temperature or Top-P, not both.
