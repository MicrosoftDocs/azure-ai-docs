# Speech service supported regions

The Speech service allows your application to convert audio to text, perform speech translation, and convert text to speech. The service is available in multiple regions with unique endpoints for the Speech SDK and REST APIs.

Keep in mind the following points:

- If your application uses a [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md), you provide the region identifier, such as `westus`, when you create a `SpeechConfig`. Make sure the region matches the region of your Speech resource.
- If your application uses one of the Speech service REST APIs, the region is part of the endpoint URI you use when making requests.
- Keys created for a region are valid only in that region. If you attempt to use them with other regions, you get authentication errors.

> [!NOTE]
> Speech service doesn't store or process your data outside the region of your Speech resource. The data is only stored or processed in the region where the resource is created. For example, if you create an AI Foundry resource for Speech in the `westus` region, the data is only in the `westus` region.

## Regions

The regions in these tables support most of the core features of the Speech service, such as speech to text, text to speech, and translation. Some features, such as fast transcription and batch synthesis require specific regions. For the features that require specific regions, the according tables indicate the regions that support them.

<sup>1</sup> Supports custom speech model processing.<br>
<sup>2</sup> The region uses dedicated hardware for custom speech training. If you plan to train a custom model, you must use one of the regions with dedicated hardware. Then you can [copy the trained model](how-to-custom-speech-train-model.md#copy-a-model) to another region.

<sup>1</sup> The Azure AI Foundry resource must be in Central India. Azure AI Speech features remain in Central India. The Voice live API uses Sweden Central as needed for generative AI load balancing.

<sup>2</sup> The resource must be in West US 2. Azure AI Speech features remain in West US 2. The Voice live API uses East US 2 as needed for generative AI load balancing.

<sup>3</sup> Currently West US 2 only supports Speech Service resources (not AI Foundry resources). Use one of the other regions to use an Azure AI Foundry resource and best integration with Azure AI Foundry Agent Service and bring-your-own-model (BYOM) support.
