### Endpoint information

This section contains Speech service endpoint information for the usage with [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md), [Speech to text REST API](rest-speech-to-text.md), and [Text to speech REST API](rest-text-to-speech.md).

#### Speech service REST API

Speech service REST API endpoints in Azure Government have the following format:

|  REST API type / operation | Endpoint format |
|--|--|
| Access token | `https://<REGION_IDENTIFIER>.api.cognitive.microsoft.us/sts/v1.0/issueToken`
| [Speech to text REST API](rest-speech-to-text.md) | `https://<REGION_IDENTIFIER>.api.cognitive.microsoft.us/<URL_PATH>` |
| [Speech to text REST API for short audio](rest-speech-to-text-short.md) | `https://<REGION_IDENTIFIER>.stt.speech.azure.us/<URL_PATH>` |
| [Text to speech REST API](rest-text-to-speech.md) | `https://<REGION_IDENTIFIER>.tts.speech.azure.us/<URL_PATH>` |

Replace `<REGION_IDENTIFIER>` with the identifier matching the region of your subscription from this table:

|                     | Region identifier |
|--|--|
| **US Gov Arizona**  | `usgovarizona` |
| **US Gov Virginia** | `usgovvirginia` |

#### Speech SDK

For [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) in sovereign clouds, you need to use "from host / with host" instantiation of `SpeechConfig` class or `--host` option of [Speech CLI](spx-overview.md). (You can also use "from endpoint / with endpoint" instantiation and `--endpoint` Speech CLI option).

`SpeechConfig` class should be instantiated like this:

# [C#](#tab/c-sharp)
```csharp
var config = SpeechConfig.FromHost(usGovHost, subscriptionKey);
```
# [C++](#tab/cpp)
```cpp
auto config = SpeechConfig::FromHost(usGovHost, subscriptionKey);
```
# [Java](#tab/java)
```java
SpeechConfig config = SpeechConfig.fromHost(usGovHost, subscriptionKey);
```
# [Python](#tab/python)
```python
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk
speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(host=usGovHost, subscription=subscriptionKey)
```
# [Objective-C](#tab/objective-c)
```objectivec
SPXSpeechConfiguration *speechConfig = [[SPXSpeechConfiguration alloc] initWithHost:usGovHost subscription:subscriptionKey];
```
***

Speech CLI should be used like this (note the `--host` option):
```dos
spx recognize --host "usGovHost" --file myaudio.wav
```
Replace `subscriptionKey` with your Speech resource key. Replace `usGovHost` with the expression matching the required service offering and the region of your subscription from this table:

|  Region / Service offering | Host expression |
|--|--|
| **US Gov Arizona** | |
| Speech to text | `wss://usgovarizona.stt.speech.azure.us` |
| Text to speech | `https://usgovarizona.tts.speech.azure.us` |
| **US Gov Virginia** | |
| Speech to text | `wss://usgovvirginia.stt.speech.azure.us` |
| Text to speech | `https://usgovvirginia.tts.speech.azure.us` |

### Endpoint information

This section contains Speech service endpoint information for the usage with [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md), [Speech to text REST API](rest-speech-to-text.md), and [Text to speech REST API](rest-text-to-speech.md).

#### Speech service REST API

Speech service REST API endpoints in Azure operated by 21Vianet have the following format:

|  REST API type / operation | Endpoint format |
|--|--|
| Access token | `https://<REGION_IDENTIFIER>.api.cognitive.azure.cn/sts/v1.0/issueToken`
| [Speech to text REST API](rest-speech-to-text.md) | `https://<REGION_IDENTIFIER>.api.cognitive.azure.cn/<URL_PATH>` |

| [Text to speech REST API](rest-text-to-speech.md) | `https://<REGION_IDENTIFIER>.tts.speech.azure.cn/<URL_PATH>` |

Replace `<REGION_IDENTIFIER>` with the identifier matching the region of your subscription from this table:

|                     | Region identifier |
|--|--|
| **China East 2**  | `chinaeast2` |
| **China North 2**  | `chinanorth2` |
| **China North 3**  | `chinanorth3` |

#### Speech SDK

For [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) in sovereign clouds you need to use "from host / with host" instantiation of `SpeechConfig` class or `--host` option of [Speech CLI](spx-overview.md). (You can also use "from endpoint / with endpoint" instantiation and `--endpoint` Speech CLI option).

`SpeechConfig` class should be instantiated like this:

# [C#](#tab/c-sharp)
```csharp
var config = SpeechConfig.FromHost("azCnHost", subscriptionKey);
```
# [C++](#tab/cpp)
```cpp
auto config = SpeechConfig::FromHost("azCnHost", subscriptionKey);
```
# [Java](#tab/java)
```java
SpeechConfig config = SpeechConfig.fromHost("azCnHost", subscriptionKey);
```
# [Python](#tab/python)
```python
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk
speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(host="azCnHost", subscription=subscriptionKey)
```
# [Objective-C](#tab/objective-c)
```objectivec
SPXSpeechConfiguration *speechConfig = [[SPXSpeechConfiguration alloc] initWithHost:"azCnHost" subscription:subscriptionKey];
```
***

Speech CLI should be used like this (note the `--host` option):
```dos
spx recognize --host "azCnHost" --file myaudio.wav
```
Replace `subscriptionKey` with your Speech resource key. Replace `azCnHost` with the expression matching the required service offering and the region of your subscription from this table:

|  Region / Service offering | Host expression |
|--|--|
| **China East 2** | |
| Speech to text | `wss://chinaeast2.stt.speech.azure.cn` |
| Text to speech | `https://chinaeast2.tts.speech.azure.cn` |
| **China North 2** | |
| Speech to text | `wss://chinanorth2.stt.speech.azure.cn` |
| Text to speech | `https://chinanorth2.tts.speech.azure.cn` |
| **China North 3** | |
| Speech to text | `wss://chinanorth3.stt.speech.azure.cn` |
| Text to speech | `https://chinanorth3.tts.speech.azure.cn` |
