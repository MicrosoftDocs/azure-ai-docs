# SSML phonetic alphabets

Phonetic alphabets are used with the [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)](speech-synthesis-markup.md) to improve the pronunciation of text to speech voices. To learn when and how to use each alphabet, see [Use phonemes to improve pronunciation](speech-synthesis-markup-pronunciation.md#phoneme-element).

Speech service supports the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) suprasegmentals that are listed here. You set `ipa` as the `alphabet` in [SSML](speech-synthesis-markup-pronunciation.md#phoneme-element). 

|`ipa` | Symbol         | Note|
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `ˈ`   | Primary stress     |  Don't use single quote (`‘` or `'`) though they look similar.  |
| `ˌ`   | Secondary stress   | Don't use comma (`,`) though it looks similar.                 |
| `.`   | Syllable boundary  |                  |
| `ː`   | Long  | Don't use colon (`:` or `：`) though they look similar.         |
| `‿`   | Linking   |           |

> [!TIP]
> You can use [the international phonetic alphabet keyboard](https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/html-ipa-keyboard-v1/keyboard/) to create the correct `ipa` suprasegmentals.

For some locales, Speech service defines its own phonetic alphabets, which ordinarily map to the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet). The eight locales that support the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI, or `sapi`) are en-US, fr-FR, de-DE, es-ES, ja-JP, zh-CN, zh-HK, and zh-TW. For those eight locales, you set `sapi` or `ipa` as the `alphabet` in [SSML](speech-synthesis-markup-pronunciation.md#phoneme-element). 

See the sections in this article for the phonemes that are specific to each locale.

> [!NOTE]
> The following tables list viseme IDs corresponding to phonemes for different locales. When viseme ID is 0, it indicates silence.
