# How to invoke a proactive greeting and pregenerated messages with Voice live

The voice agent user experience build with the Voice live API can be enhanced for advanced use cases by adding proactive greeting messages or pregenerated messages.

Common use-cases are:
* Call center voice agents proactively greeting customers when answering calls
* Voice agents and avatars proactively greeting users to provide guidance at the start of the conversation on the available use cases
* Pregenerated phrases for legal or compliance sensitive responses
