# Migrate code from v3.2 to version 2024-11-15

The Speech to text REST API is used for [fast transcription](./fast-transcription-create.md), [batch transcription](batch-transcription.md), and [custom speech](custom-speech-overview.md). This article describes changes from version 3.2 to version 2024-11-15.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Speech to text REST API version `2024-11-15` is the latest version that's generally available. 
> - [Speech to text REST API](rest-speech-to-text.md) version `2024-05-15-preview` will be retired on a date to be announced. 
> - Speech to text REST API `v3.0`, `v3.1`, `v3.2`, `3.2-preview.1`, and `3.2-preview.2` will be retired on April 1st, 2026. 
> 
> For more information about upgrading, see the Speech to text REST API [v3.0 to v3.1](migrate-v3-0-to-v3-1.md), [v3.1 to v3.2](migrate-v3-1-to-v3-2.md), and [v3.2 to 2024-11-15](migrate-2024-11-15.md) migration guides.

## Base path

Custom speech API switched from a path based versioning scheme to a query parameter based scheme in alignment with general Azure API versioning schemes. This required changes to the used base path. Update path from `/speechtotext/v3.2` to `/speechtotext` and append API version with `?api-version=2024-11-15` to all requests.

## Datasets

The `email` property and the connected email notification process is removed from the API.

The `duration` property in dataset responses is renamed from `duration` to `durationMilliseconds` and are now a plain number instead of an ISO8601 formatted string (P1D2H3M4S…) to further simply processing.

The query parameter `sasValidityInSeconds` is renamed to `sasLifetimeMinutes` for getting files. Usage is only allowed for an account with BYOS disabled. For BYOS enabled accounts, SAS URLs aren't returned.

The `project` property is removed in creation requests.

## Models

Removed the `text` property in a model creation request. The alternative is to create a dataset with the text content and create a dataset first, which then is later on used for model creation.

The `email` property and the connected email notification process is removed from the API.

The query parameter `sasValidityInSeconds` is renamed to `sasLifetimeMinutes` for getting files. Usage is only allowed for an account with BYOS (bring your own storage) disabled. For BYOS enabled accounts, SAS URLs aren't returned.

The `GET models/id/manifest` operation now always requires a nonzero SAS lifetime. The corresponding `sasValidityInSeconds` property is renamed to `sasLifetimeMinutes`.

The `project` property is removed in creation requests.
 
## Evaluations

The query parameter `sasValidityInSeconds` is renamed to `sasLifetimeMinutes` for getting files. Usage is only allowed for an account with BYOS disabled. For BYOS enabled accounts, SAS URLs aren't returned.

The `project` property is removed in creation requests

The `email` property and the connected email notification process is removed from the API.

## Endpoints

The API to retrieve and delete log files of endpoint logs is removed. Custom speech now supports BYOS (bring your own storage). Only accounts with BYOS enabled can enable logging on model endpoints. This offers full manageability of log files on customer storage instead of a proxy API.

Removed support for `timeToLive` in endpoint creations.

Removed the `text` property in an endpoint creation request. The alternative is to create a dataset with the text content and create a dataset first, which then is later on used for model creation. This model can then be used to create an endpoint.

Endpoint links now only return endpoint of websocket connection, used for SDK.

The `project` property is removed in creation requests.

The `email` property and the connected email notification process is removed from the API.

## Transcriptions

Removed the top-level `diarizationEnabled` property of a transcription. The diarization configuration is simplified to `"diarization": {"maxSpeakers": 2,"enabled": true}`. The `maxSpeakers` property is optional and defaults to 2. The `enabled` property is required for diarization.

Transcription creation: `timeToLive` renamed to `timeToLiveHours` including a format change from ISO8601 formatted string to a simple int (number of hours).

The `duration` property in transcription responses is renamed from `duration` to `durationMilliseconds` and are now a plain number instead of an ISO8601 formatted string (P1D2H3M4S…) to further simplify processing. Transcription result files have this property added for consistency with API.

The query parameter `sasValidityInSeconds` is renamed to `sasLifetimeMinutes` for getting files. Usage is only allowed for an account with BYOS disabled. For BYOS enabled accounts, SAS URLs aren't returned.

The `project` property is removed in creation requests.

The `email` property and the connected email notification process is removed from the API.
 
## Projects

The projects API is removed.
