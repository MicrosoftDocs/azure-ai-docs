# How to recognize intents with custom entity pattern matching

The Azure AI services [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) has a built-in feature to provide **intent recognition** with **simple language pattern matching**. An intent is something the user wants to do: close a window, mark a checkbox, insert some text, etc.

In this guide, you use the Speech SDK to develop a console application that derives intents from speech utterances spoken through your device's microphone. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a Visual Studio project referencing the Speech SDK NuGet package
> - Create a speech configuration and get an intent recognizer
> - Add intents and patterns via the Speech SDK API
> - Add custom entities via the Speech SDK API
> - Use asynchronous, event-driven continuous recognition

## When to use pattern matching

Use pattern matching if: 
* You're only interested in matching strictly what the user said. These patterns match more aggressively than [conversational language understanding (CLU)](../language-service/conversational-language-understanding/overview.md).
* You don't have access to a CLU model, but still want intents. 

For more information, see the [pattern matching overview](./pattern-matching-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

Be sure you have the following items before you begin this guide:

- An [Azure AI services resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices) or a [Unified Speech resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices)
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (any edition).
