# How to use batch synthesis for text to speech avatar

The batch synthesis API for text to speech avatar allows for the asynchronous synthesis of text into a talking avatar as a video file. Publishers and video content platforms can utilize this API to create avatar video content in a batch. That approach can be suitable for various use cases such as training materials, presentations, or advertisements.

The synthetic avatar video will be generated asynchronously after the system receives text input. The generated video output can be downloaded in batch mode synthesis. You submit text for synthesis, poll for the synthesis status, and download the video output when the status indicates success. The text input formats must be plain text or Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) text. 

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the workflow.

To perform batch synthesis, you can use the following REST API operations.

| Operation            | Method  | REST API call                                      |
|----------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [Create batch synthesis](#create-a-batch-synthesis-request) | PUT    | avatar/batchsyntheses/{SynthesisId}?api-version=2024-08-01 |
| [Get batch synthesis](#get-batch-synthesis)    | GET     | avatar/batchsyntheses/{SynthesisId}?api-version=2024-08-01 |
| [List batch synthesis](#list-batch-synthesis)   | GET     | avatar/batchsyntheses/?api-version=2024-08-01 |
| [Delete batch synthesis](#delete-batch-synthesis) | DELETE  | avatar/batchsyntheses/{SynthesisId}?api-version=2024-08-01 |

You can refer to the code samples on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/batch-avatar).

## Create a batch synthesis request

Some properties in JSON format are required when you create a new batch synthesis job. Other properties are optional. The [batch synthesis response](#get-batch-synthesis) includes other properties to provide information about the synthesis status and results. For example, the `outputs.result` property contains the location from [where you can download a video file](#get-batch-synthesis-results-file) containing the avatar video. From `outputs.summary`, you can access the summary and debug details. 

To submit a batch synthesis request, construct the HTTP POST request body following these instructions:

- Set the required `inputKind` property.
- If the `inputKind` property is set to `PlainText`, you must also set the `voice` property in the `synthesisConfig`. In the example below, the `inputKind` is set to `SSML`, so the `speechSynthesis` isn't set.
- Set the required `SynthesisId` property. Choose a unique `SynthesisId` for the same speech resource. The `SynthesisId` can be a string of 3 to 64 characters, including letters, numbers, '-', or '_', with the condition that it must start and end with a letter or number.
- Set the required `talkingAvatarCharacter` and `talkingAvatarStyle` properties. You can find supported avatar characters and styles [here](./avatar-gestures-with-ssml.md#supported-prebuilt-avatar-characters-styles-and-gestures).
- Optionally, you can set the `videoFormat`, `backgroundColor`, and other properties. For more information, see [batch synthesis properties](batch-synthesis-avatar-properties.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum JSON payload size accepted is 500 kilobytes.
>
> Each Speech resource can have up to 200 batch synthesis jobs running concurrently.
>
> The maximum length for the output video is currently 20 minutes, with potential increases in the future.

To make an HTTP PUT request, use the URI format shown in the following example. Replace `YourSpeechKey` with your Speech resource key, `YourSpeechRegion` with your Speech resource region, and set the request body properties as described above.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X PUT -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechKey" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "inputKind": "SSML",
    "inputs": [
        {
         "content": "<speak version='\''1.0'\'' xml:lang='\''en-US'\''><voice name='\''en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural'\''>The rainbow has seven colors.</voice></speak>"
        }
    ],
    "avatarConfig": {
        "talkingAvatarCharacter": "lisa",
        "talkingAvatarStyle": "graceful-sitting"
    }
}'  "https://YourSpeechRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/avatar/batchsyntheses/my-job-01?api-version=2024-08-01"
```

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
    "id": "my-job-01",
    "internalId": "5a25b929-1358-4e81-a036-33000e788c46",
    "status": "NotStarted",
    "createdDateTime": "2024-03-06T07:34:08.9487009Z",
    "lastActionDateTime": "2024-03-06T07:34:08.9487012Z",
    "inputKind": "SSML",
    "customVoices": {},
    "properties": {
        "timeToLiveInHours": 744,
    },
    "avatarConfig": {
        "talkingAvatarCharacter": "lisa",
        "talkingAvatarStyle": "graceful-sitting",
        "videoFormat": "Mp4",
        "videoCodec": "hevc",
        "subtitleType": "soft_embedded",
        "bitrateKbps": 2000,
        "customized": false
    }
}
```

The `status` property should progress from `NotStarted` status to `Running` and finally to `Succeeded` or `Failed`. You can periodically call the [GET batch synthesis API](#get-batch-synthesis) until the returned status is `Succeeded` or `Failed`.


## Get batch synthesis

To retrieve the status of a batch synthesis job, make an HTTP GET request using the URI as shown in the following example. 

Replace `YourSynthesisId` with your batch synthesis ID, `YourSpeechKey` with your Speech resource key, and `YourSpeechRegion` with your Speech resource region.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X GET "https://YourSpeechRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/avatar/batchsyntheses/YourSynthesisId?api-version=2024-08-01" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechKey"
```

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
    "id": "my-job-01",
    "internalId": "5a25b929-1358-4e81-a036-33000e788c46",
    "status": "Succeeded",
    "createdDateTime": "2024-03-06T07:34:08.9487009Z",
    "lastActionDateTime": "2024-03-06T07:34:12.5698769",
    "inputKind": "SSML",
    "customVoices": {},
    "properties": {
        "timeToLiveInHours": 744,
        "sizeInBytes": 344460,
        "durationInMilliseconds": 2520,
        "succeededCount": 1,
        "failedCount": 0,
        "billingDetails": {
            "neuralCharacters": 29,
            "talkingAvatarDurationSeconds": 2
        }
    },
    "avatarConfig": {
        "talkingAvatarCharacter": "lisa",
        "talkingAvatarStyle": "graceful-sitting",
        "videoFormat": "Mp4",
        "videoCodec": "hevc",
        "subtitleType": "soft_embedded",
        "bitrateKbps": 2000,
        "customized": false
    },
    "outputs": {
        "result": "https://stttssvcprodusw2.blob.core.windows.net/batchsynthesis-output/xxxxx/xxxxx/0001.mp4?SAS_Token",
        "summary": "https://stttssvcprodusw2.blob.core.windows.net/batchsynthesis-output/xxxxx/xxxxx/summary.json?SAS_Token"
    }
}
```

From the `outputs.result` field, you can download a video file containing the avatar video. The `outputs.summary` field allows you to download the summary and debug details. For more information on batch synthesis results, see [batch synthesis results](#get-batch-synthesis-results-file).


## List batch synthesis

To list all batch synthesis jobs for your Speech resource, make an HTTP GET request using the URI as shown in the following example.

Replace `YourSpeechKey` with your Speech resource key and `YourSpeechRegion` with your Speech resource region. Optionally, you can set the `skip` and `top` (page size) query parameters in the URL. The default value for `skip` is 0, and the default value for `maxpagesize` is 100.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X GET "https://YourSpeechRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/avatar/batchsyntheses?skip=0&maxpagesize=2&api-version=2024-08-01" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechKey"
```

You receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "my-job-02",
            "internalId": "14c25fcf-3cb6-4f46-8810-ecad06d956df",

                "summary": "https://stttssvcprodusw2.blob.core.windows.net/batchsynthesis-output/xxxxx/xxxxx/summary.json?SAS_Token"
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "my-job-01",
            "internalId": "5a25b929-1358-4e81-a036-33000e788c46",
            "status": "Succeeded",
            "createdDateTime": "2024-03-06T07:34:08.9487009Z",

                "bitrateKbps": 2000,
                "customized": false
            },
            "outputs": {
                "result": "https://stttssvcprodusw2.blob.core.windows.net/batchsynthesis-output/xxxxx/xxxxx/0001.mp4?SAS_Token",
                "summary": "https://stttssvcprodusw2.blob.core.windows.net/batchsynthesis-output/xxxxx/xxxxx/summary.json?SAS_Token"
            }
        }
    ],
    "nextLink": "https://YourSpeechRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/avatar/batchsyntheses/?api-version=2024-08-01&skip=2&maxpagesize=2"
}
```

From `outputs.result`, you can download a video file containing the avatar video. From `outputs.summary`, you can access the summary and debug details. For more information, see [batch synthesis results](#get-batch-synthesis-results-file).

The `value` property in the JSON response lists your synthesis requests. The list is paginated, with a maximum page size of 100. The `nextLink` property is provided as needed to get the next page of the paginated list.

## Get batch synthesis results file

Once you get a batch synthesis job with `status` of "Succeeded", you can download the video output results. Use the URL from the `outputs.result` property of the [get batch synthesis](#get-batch-synthesis) response.

To get the batch synthesis results file, make an HTTP GET request using the URI as shown in the following example. Replace `YourOutputsResultUrl` with the URL from the `outputs.result` property of the [get batch synthesis](#get-batch-synthesis) response. Replace `YourSpeechKey` with your Speech resource key.

```azurecli-interactive 
curl -v -X GET "YourOutputsResultUrl" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechKey" > output.mp4
```

To get the batch synthesis summary file, make an HTTP GET request using the URI as shown in the following example. Replace `YourOutputsResultUrl` with the URL from the `outputs.summary` property of the [get batch synthesis](#get-batch-synthesis) response. Replace `YourSpeechKey` with your Speech resource key.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X GET "YourOutputsSummaryUrl" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechKey" > summary.json
```

The summary file contains the synthesis results for each text input. Here's an example summary.json file:

```json
{
  "jobID": "5a25b929-1358-4e81-a036-33000e788c46",
  "status": "Succeeded",
  "results": [
    {
      "texts": [
        "<speak version='1.0' xml:lang='en-US'><voice name='en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural'>The rainbow has seven colors.</voice></speak>"
      ],
      "status": "Succeeded",
      "videoFileName": "244a87c294b94ddeb3dbaccee8ffa7eb/5a25b929-1358-4e81-a036-33000e788c46/0001.mp4",
      "TalkingAvatarCharacter": "lisa",
      "TalkingAvatarStyle": "graceful-sitting"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Delete batch synthesis

After you have retrieved the audio output results and no longer need the batch synthesis job history, you can delete it. The Speech service retains each synthesis history for up to 31 days or the duration specified by the request's `timeToLiveInHours` property, whichever comes sooner. The date and time of automatic deletion, for synthesis jobs with a status of "Succeeded" or "Failed" is calculated as the sum of the `lastActionDateTime` and `timeToLive` properties.

To delete a batch synthesis job, make an HTTP DELETE request using the following URI format. Replace `YourSynthesisId` with your batch synthesis ID, `YourSpeechKey` with your Speech resource key, and `YourSpeechRegion` with your Speech resource region.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X DELETE "https://YourSpeechRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/avatar/batchsyntheses/YourSynthesisId?api-version=2024-08-01" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechKey"
```

The response headers include `HTTP/1.1 204 No Content` if the delete request was successful.
