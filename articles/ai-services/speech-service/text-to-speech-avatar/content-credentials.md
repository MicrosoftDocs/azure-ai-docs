# Content credentials

Content credentials help you verify that Azure text to speech avatar generated your video content. This transparency feature automatically adds tamper-evident information about your video's origin and creation history, following industry standards from the [Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)](https://www.c2pa.org).

Use content credentials to:
- Confirm video authenticity for your audiences
- Meet transparency requirements for AI-generated content
- Build trust in your avatar-powered solutions

Content credentials are automatically applied to all supported video formatsâ€”no additional setup required.

## What are content credentials?

Azure text to speech avatar adds a content credentials manifest to each avatar video, giving you information about the video's origin. A cryptographic signature secures the manifest, linking it back to Azure text to speech avatar.

The manifest has several key pieces of information:

| Field name | Field content |
| --- | --- |
| `"generator"` | This field has a value of `"Microsoft Azure Txt to Speech Avatar Service"` for all applicable videos, confirming the AI-generated nature of the video. |
| `"when"` | The timestamp of when the content credentials were created. |

Content credentials in Azure text to speech avatar can help people understand when video content is generated by the Azure text to speech avatar system. For more information on how to responsibly build solutions with text to speech avatar models, see the [Text to speech transparency note](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/speech-service/text-to-speech/transparency-note).

## Limitations

The content credentials are only supported in video files generated by batch synthesis of text to speech avatar, and only `mp4` file format is supported.

## Use content credentials in your solution

You can use content credentials by ensuring that your Azure text to speech avatar generated video files have content credentials.

No extra setup is necessary. Content credentials are automatically applied to all applicable videos generated by Azure text to speech avatar.

## Check that a video file has content credentials

You can check the content credentials of a text to speech avatar using either of the following methods:

- **Content credentials verify webpage ([contentcredentials.org/verify](https://contentcredentials.org/verify))**: This tool lets users inspect the content credentials of content like a video. If an uploaded video of a text to speech avatar is created with the Speech service, the tool will show that and display the issued date and time of the content credentials. This screenshot shows an example avatar video upload result where the content credentials were issued by Microsoft.

  This page shows that a video generated by Azure text to speech avatar has content credentials issued by Microsoft.

- **Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) open-source tools**: The CAI provides multiple open-source tools that can be used to validate and display C2PA content credentials. Find the right tool for your application and [get started here](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/).
