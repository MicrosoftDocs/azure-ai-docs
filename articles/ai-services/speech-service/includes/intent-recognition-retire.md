> [!IMPORTANT]
> Intent recognition in Azure AI Speech was retired on September 30, 2025. Applications can no longer use intent recognition via Azure AI Speech. However, you're still able to perform intent recognition using Azure AI Language Service or Azure OpenAI.
> 
> This change doesn't affect other Azure AI Speech capabilities such as [speech to text](../speech-to-text.md) (including no change to speaker diarization), [text to speech](../text-to-speech.md), and [speech translation](../speech-translation.md).
