> [!IMPORTANT]
> Intent recognition in Azure Speech in Foundry Tools was retired on September 30, 2025. Applications can no longer use intent recognition via Azure Speech in Foundry Tools. However, you're still able to perform intent recognition using Azure Language in Foundry Tools Service or Azure OpenAI.
> 
> This change doesn't affect other Azure Speech capabilities such as [speech to text](../speech-to-text.md) (including no change to speaker diarization), [text to speech](../text-to-speech.md), and [speech translation](../speech-translation.md).
