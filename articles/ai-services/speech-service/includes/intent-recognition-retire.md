> [!IMPORTANT]
> Intent recognition in Azure AI Speech is being retired on September 30,2025. Your applications won't be able to use intent recognition directly via Azure AI Speech after this date. However, you're still able to perform intent recognition using Azure AI Language Service or Azure OpenAI.
> 
> This change doesn't affect other Azure AI Speech capabilities such as [speech to text](../speech-to-text.md) (including no change to speaker diarization), [text to speech](../text-to-speech.md), and [speech translation](../speech-translation.md).
