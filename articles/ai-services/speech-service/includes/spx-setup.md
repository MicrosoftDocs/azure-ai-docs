#### [Windows](#tab/windowsinstall)

Follow these steps to install the Speech CLI on Windows:

1. Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version) for your platform. Installing it for the first time might require a restart.
1. Install [.NET 8](/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60#runtime-information).
1. Install the Speech CLI via the .NET CLI by entering this command:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI
   ```
   To update the Speech CLI, enter this command:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet tool update --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI
   ```

Enter `spx` or `spx help` to see help for the Speech CLI.

### Font limitations

On Windows, the Speech CLI can show only fonts that are available to the command prompt on the local computer. [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) supports all fonts that the Speech CLI produces interactively.

If you output to a file, a text editor like Notepad or a web browser like Microsoft Edge can also show all fonts.

#### [Linux](#tab/linuxinstall)

The following Linux distributions are supported for x64 architectures that use the Speech CLI:

- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04
- Debian 11/12

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech SDK (not the Speech CLI) supports additional architectures. For more information, see [About the Speech SDK](../speech-sdk.md).

Follow these steps to install the Speech CLI on Linux on an x64 CPU:

1. Install the [.NET 8](/dotnet/core/install/linux).
2. Install the Speech CLI via the .NET CLI by entering this command:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI
   ```
   To update the Speech CLI, enter this command:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet tool update --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI
   ```

3. Install GStreamer for [compressed audio support](../how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md).

Enter `spx` to see help for the Speech CLI.

#### [macOS](#tab/macOS)

Follow these steps to install the Speech CLI on macOS 10.14 or later:

1. Install [.NET 8](/dotnet/core/install/macos#runtime-information).
1. Install the Speech CLI via the .NET CLI by entering this command:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI
   ```
   To update the Speech CLI, enter this command:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet tool update --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI
   ```

Enter `spx` or `spx help` to see help for the Speech CLI.

#### [Docker (Windows, Linux, macOS)](#tab/dockerinstall)

The following example pulls a public container image from Docker Hub. We recommend that you authenticate with your Docker Hub account (`docker login`) first instead of making an anonymous pull request. To improve reliability when you're using public content, import and manage the image in a private Azure Container Registry. [Learn more about working with public images](/azure/container-registry/buffer-gate-public-content).

Follow these steps to install the Speech CLI in a Docker container:

1. <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" target="_blank">Install Docker Desktop</a> for your platform if it isn't already installed.
2. In a new command prompt or terminal, enter this command:
   ```console
   docker pull msftspeech/spx
   ```

Enter this command to display help information for the Speech CLI:

```console
docker run -it --rm msftspeech/spx help
```

### Mount a directory in the container

The Speech CLI tool saves configuration settings as files. It loads these files when you're performing any command (except help commands).

When you're using the Speech CLI within a Docker container, you must mount a local directory from the container, so the tool can:

- Store or find the configuration settings.
- Read or write any files that the command requires, such as audio files of speech.

On Windows, enter this command to create a local directory that the Speech CLI can use from within the container:

`mkdir c:\spx-data`

On Linux or macOS, enter this command in a terminal to create a directory and see its absolute path:

```bash
mkdir ~/spx-data
cd ~/spx-data
pwd
```

You'll use the absolute path when you call the Speech CLI.

### Run the Speech CLI in the container

This documentation shows the Speech CLI `spx` command used in non-Docker installations. When you're calling the `spx` command in a Docker container, you must mount a directory in the container to your file system where the Speech CLI can store and find configuration values and read and write files.

On Windows, your commands start like this:

```console
docker run -it -v c:\spx-data:/data --rm msftspeech/spx
```

On Linux or macOS, your commands look like the following sample. Replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH` with the absolute path for your mounted directory. The `pwd` command returned this path in the previous section. If you run this command before setting your key and region, you'll get an error that tells you to set your key and region.

```console
sudo docker run -it -v ABSOLUTE_PATH:/data --rm msftspeech/spx
```

To use the `spx` command installed in a container, always enter the full command as shown in the preceding sample, followed by the parameters of your request. For example, on Windows, this command sets your key:

```console
docker run -it -v c:\spx-data:/data --rm msftspeech/spx config @key --set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY
```

For more extended interaction with the command-line tool, you can start a container with an interactive Bash shell by adding an `entrypoint` parameter. On Windows, enter this command to start a container that exposes an interactive command-line interface where you can enter multiple `spx` commands:

```console
docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash -v c:\spx-data:/data --rm msftspeech/spx
```

You can combine that with AZ Login and have SPX Init guide you through creating the speech keys and selecting a matching data region without having to use the Azure portal. The keys will automatically be stored for later use.

   ```
   docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash -v c:\spx-data:/data msftspeech/spx

   az login
   spx init
   ```
