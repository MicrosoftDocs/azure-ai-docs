Create a new file named `.env` in the folder where you want to run the code. 

In the `.env` file, add the following environment variables for authentication:

```plaintext
AZURE_VOICELIVE_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
AZURE_VOICELIVE_MODEL=<your_model>
AZURE_VOICELIVE_API_VERSION=2025-10-01
AZURE_VOICELIVE_API_KEY=<your_api_key> # Only required if using API key authentication
```

Replace the default values with your actual endpoint, model, API version, and API key.

#### [Microsoft Entra ID](#tab/keyless)

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_VOICELIVE_ENDPOINT` | This value can be found in the **Keys and Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. |
| `AZURE_VOICELIVE_MODEL` | The model you want to use. For example, `gpt-4o` or `gpt-realtime-mini`. For more information about models availability, see the [Voice Live API overview documentation](../../../voice-live.md). |
| `AZURE_VOICELIVE_API_VERSION`| The API version you want to use. For example, `2025-10-01`. |
