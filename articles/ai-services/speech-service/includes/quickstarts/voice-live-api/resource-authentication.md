| `AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_ENDPOINT` | This value can be found in the **Keys and Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. |
| `VOICE_LIVE_MODEL` | The model you want to use. For example, `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`. For more information about models availability, see the [Voice Live API overview documentation](../../../voice-live.md). |
| `AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_API_VERSION`| The API version you want to use. For example, `2025-05-01-preview`. |
