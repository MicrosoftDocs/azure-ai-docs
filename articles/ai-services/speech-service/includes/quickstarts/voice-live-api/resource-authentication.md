Create a new file named `.env` in the folder where you want to run the code. 

In the `.env` file, add the following environment variables for authentication:

```plaintext
AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
VOICE_LIVE_MODEL=<your_model>
AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_API_VERSION=2025-05-01-preview
AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_API_KEY=<your_api_key> # Only required if using API key authentication
```

Replace the default values with your actual endpoint, model, API version, and API key.
