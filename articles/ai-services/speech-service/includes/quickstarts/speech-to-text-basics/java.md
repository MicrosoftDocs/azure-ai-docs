[!INCLUDE [Header](../../common/java.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Introduction](intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites-resourcekey-endpoint.md)]

## Set up the environment

To set up your environment, [install the Speech SDK](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-java&tabs=jre). The sample in this quickstart works with the [Java Runtime](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-java&tabs=jre).

1. Install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). Then run `mvn -v` to confirm successful installation.
1. Create a new `pom.xml` file in the root of your project, and copy the following code into it:

   ```xml
   <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
       <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
       <groupId>com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.samples</groupId>
       <artifactId>quickstart-eclipse</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
       <build>
           <sourceDirectory>src</sourceDirectory>
           <plugins>
           <plugin>
               <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
               <version>3.7.0</version>
               <configuration>
               <source>1.8</source>
               <target>1.8</target>
               </configuration>
           </plugin>
           </plugins>
       </build>
       <dependencies>
           <dependency>
           <groupId>com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech</groupId>
           <artifactId>client-sdk</artifactId>
           <version>1.43.0</version>
           </dependency>
       </dependencies>
   </project>
   ```

1. Install the Speech SDK and dependencies.

   ```console
   mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies
   ```

### Set environment variables

[!INCLUDE [Environment variables](../../common/environment-variables-resourcekey-endpoint.md)]

## Recognize speech from a microphone

Follow these steps to create a console application for speech recognition.

1. Create a new file named *SpeechRecognition.java* in the same project root directory.
1. Copy the following code into *SpeechRecognition.java*:

   ```java
   import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.*;
   import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.AudioConfig;

   import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
   import java.util.concurrent.Future;

   public class SpeechRecognition {
       // This example requires environment variables named "SPEECH_KEY" and "ENDPOINT"
       private static String speechKey = System.getenv("SPEECH_KEY");
       private static String endpoint = System.getenv("ENDPOINT");

       public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
           SpeechConfig speechConfig = SpeechConfig.fromEndpoint(speechKey, endpoint);
           speechConfig.setSpeechRecognitionLanguage("en-US");
           recognizeFromMicrophone(speechConfig);
       }

       public static void recognizeFromMicrophone(SpeechConfig speechConfig) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
           AudioConfig audioConfig = AudioConfig.fromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
           SpeechRecognizer speechRecognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

           System.out.println("Speak into your microphone.");
           Future<SpeechRecognitionResult> task = speechRecognizer.recognizeOnceAsync();
           SpeechRecognitionResult speechRecognitionResult = task.get();

           if (speechRecognitionResult.getReason() == ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech) {
               System.out.println("RECOGNIZED: Text=" + speechRecognitionResult.getText());
           }
           else if (speechRecognitionResult.getReason() == ResultReason.NoMatch) {
               System.out.println("NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
           }
           else if (speechRecognitionResult.getReason() == ResultReason.Canceled) {
               CancellationDetails cancellation = CancellationDetails.fromResult(speechRecognitionResult);
               System.out.println("CANCELED: Reason=" + cancellation.getReason());

               if (cancellation.getReason() == CancellationReason.Error) {
                   System.out.println("CANCELED: ErrorCode=" + cancellation.getErrorCode());
                   System.out.println("CANCELED: ErrorDetails=" + cancellation.getErrorDetails());
                   System.out.println("CANCELED: Did you set the speech resource key and endpoint values?");
               }
           }

           System.exit(0);
       }
   }
   ```

1. To change the speech recognition language, replace `en-US` with another [supported language](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-support.md). For example, use `es-ES` for Spanish (Spain). If you don't specify a language, the default is `en-US`. For details about how to identify one of multiple languages that might be spoken, see [Language identification](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-identification.md).

1. Run your new console application to start speech recognition from a microphone:

   ```console
   javac SpeechRecognition.java -cp ".;target\dependency\*"
   java -cp ".;target\dependency\*" SpeechRecognition
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure that you set the `SPEECH_KEY` and `ENDPOINT` [environment variables](#set-environment-variables). If you don't set these variables, the sample fails with an error message.

1. Speak into your microphone when prompted. What you speak should appear as text:

   ```output
   Speak into your microphone.
   RECOGNIZED: Text=I'm excited to try speech to text.
   ```

## Remarks

Here are some other considerations:

- This example uses the `RecognizeOnceAsync` operation to transcribe utterances of up to 30 seconds, or until silence is detected. For information about continuous recognition for longer audio, including multi-lingual conversations, see [How to recognize speech](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-recognize-speech.md).
- To recognize speech from an audio file, use `fromWavFileInput` instead of `fromDefaultMicrophoneInput`:

   ```java
   AudioConfig audioConfig = AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
   ```

- For compressed audio files such as MP4, install GStreamer and use `PullAudioInputStream` or `PushAudioInputStream`. For more information, see [How to use compressed input audio](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md).
