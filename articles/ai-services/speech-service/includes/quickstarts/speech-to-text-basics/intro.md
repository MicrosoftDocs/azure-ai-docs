In this quickstart, you create and run an application to recognize and transcribe speech to text in real-time. 

> [!TIP]
> For fast transcription of audio files, consider using the [fast transcription API.](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/fast-transcription-create) Fast transcription API supports features such as language identification and diarization. 

To instead transcribe audio files asynchronously, see [What is batch transcription](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/batch-transcription.md). If you're not sure which speech to text solution is right for you, see [What is speech to text?](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/speech-to-text.md)
