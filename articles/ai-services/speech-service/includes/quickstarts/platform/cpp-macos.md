This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for C++ on macOS 10.14 or later. The steps include downloading the [required libraries and header files](https://aka.ms/csspeech/macosbinary) as a *.zip* file.

1. Choose a directory for the Speech SDK files. Set the `SPEECHSDK_ROOT` environment variable to point to that directory. This variable makes it easy to refer to the directory in future commands.

   To use the directory *speechsdk* in your home directory, run the following command:

   ```console
   export SPEECHSDK_ROOT="$HOME/speechsdk"
   ```

1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist:

   ```console
   mkdir -p "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

1. Download and extract the *.zip* archive that contains the Speech SDK XCFramework:

   ```console
   wget -O SpeechSDK-macOS.zip https://aka.ms/csspeech/macosbinary
   unzip SpeechSDK-macOS.zip -d "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

1. Validate the contents of the top-level directory of the extracted package:

   ```console
   ls -l "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

   The directory listing should contain the partner notice, license files, and a *MicrosoftCognitiveServicesSpeech.xcframework* directory.
