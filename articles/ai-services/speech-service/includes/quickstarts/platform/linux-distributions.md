The Speech SDK depends on the following Linux system libraries:

- The shared libraries of the GNU C library, including the POSIX Threads Programming library, `libpthreads`.
- The OpenSSL library, version 1.x (`libssl1`) or 3.x (`libssl3`), and certificates (`ca-certificates`).
- The shared library for ALSA applications (`libasound2`).
