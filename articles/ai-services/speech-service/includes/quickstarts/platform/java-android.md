This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](../../../speech-sdk.md) for Java on Android.

The Speech SDK for Android is packaged as an [Android Archive (AAR) file](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), which includes the necessary libraries and required Android permissions.

### Install the Speech SDK by using Android Studio

Create a new project in Android Studio and add the Speech SDK for Java as a library dependency. The setup is based on the Speech SDK Maven Package and Android Studio Chipmunk 2021.2.1.

#### Create an empty project

1. Open Android Studio, and select **New project**.
