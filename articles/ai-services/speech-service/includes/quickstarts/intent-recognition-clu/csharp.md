[!INCLUDE [Introduction](intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites-clu.md)]

## Set up the environment
The Speech SDK is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech) and implements .NET Standard 2.0. You install the Speech SDK later in this guide, but first check the [SDK installation guide](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) for any more requirements.

### Set environment variables

This example requires environment variables named `LANGUAGE_KEY`, `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`, `SPEECH_KEY`, and `SPEECH_REGION`.

[!INCLUDE [Environment variables](../../common/environment-variables-clu.md)]

## Create a Conversational Language Understanding project

[!INCLUDE [Deploy CLU model](deploy-clu-model.md)]

You'll use the project name and deployment name in the next section.

## Recognize intents from a microphone

Follow these steps to create a new console application and install the Speech SDK.

1. Open a command prompt where you want the new project, and create a console application with the .NET CLI. The `Program.cs` file should be created in the project directory.
    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new console
    ```
1. Install the Speech SDK in your new project with the .NET CLI.
    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet add package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech
    ```
1. Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the following code. 

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Intent;
    
    class Program 
    {
        // This example requires environment variables named:
        // "LANGUAGE_KEY", "LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT", "SPEECH_KEY", and "SPEECH_REGION"
        static string languageKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LANGUAGE_KEY");
        static string languageEndpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT");
        static string speechKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SPEECH_KEY");
        static string speechRegion = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SPEECH_REGION");

        // Your CLU project name and deployment name.
        static string cluProjectName = "YourProjectNameGoesHere";
        static string cluDeploymentName = "YourDeploymentNameGoesHere";
    
        async static Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription(speechKey, speechRegion);        
            speechConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "en-US";
    
            using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
    
            // Creates an intent recognizer in the specified language using microphone as audio input.
            using (var intentRecognizer = new IntentRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig))
            {
                var cluModel = new ConversationalLanguageUnderstandingModel(
                    languageKey,
                    languageEndpoint,
                    cluProjectName, 
                    cluDeploymentName);
                var collection = new LanguageUnderstandingModelCollection();
                collection.Add(cluModel);
                intentRecognizer.ApplyLanguageModels(collection);
    
                Console.WriteLine("Speak into your microphone.");
                var recognitionResult = await intentRecognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
                
                // Checks result.
                if (recognitionResult.Reason == ResultReason.RecognizedIntent)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={recognitionResult.Text}");
                    Console.WriteLine($"    Intent Id: {recognitionResult.IntentId}.");
                    Console.WriteLine($"    Language Understanding JSON: {recognitionResult.Properties.GetProperty(PropertyId.LanguageUnderstandingServiceResponse_JsonResult)}.");
                }
                else if (recognitionResult.Reason == ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={recognitionResult.Text}");
                    Console.WriteLine($"    Intent not recognized.");
                }
                else if (recognitionResult.Reason == ResultReason.NoMatch)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
                }
                else if (recognitionResult.Reason == ResultReason.Canceled)
                {
                    var cancellation = CancellationDetails.FromResult(recognitionResult);
                    Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={cancellation.Reason}");
    
                    if (cancellation.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={cancellation.ErrorCode}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails={cancellation.ErrorDetails}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you update the Speech resource info?");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. In `Program.cs` set the `cluProjectName` and `cluDeploymentName` variables to the names of your project and deployment. For information about how to create a CLU project and deployment, see [Create a Conversational Language Understanding project](#create-a-conversational-language-understanding-project).
1. To change the speech recognition language, replace `en-US` with another [supported language](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-support.md). For example, `es-ES` for Spanish (Spain). The default language is `en-US` if you don't specify a language. For details about how to identify one of multiple languages that might be spoken, see [language identification](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-identification.md). 

Run your new console application to start speech recognition from a microphone:

```console
dotnet run
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you set the `LANGUAGE_KEY`, `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`, `SPEECH_KEY`, and `SPEECH_REGION` environment variables as described [above](#set-environment-variables). If you don't set these variables, the sample will fail with an error message.

Speak into your microphone when prompted. What you speak should be output as text: 

```console
Speak into your microphone.
RECOGNIZED: Text=Turn on the lights.
    Intent Id: HomeAutomation.TurnOn.
    Language Understanding JSON: {"kind":"ConversationResult","result":{"query":"turn on the lights","prediction":{"topIntent":"HomeAutomation.TurnOn","projectKind":"Conversation","intents":[{"category":"HomeAutomation.TurnOn","confidenceScore":0.97712576},{"category":"HomeAutomation.TurnOff","confidenceScore":0.8431633},{"category":"None","confidenceScore":0.782861}],"entities":[{"category":"HomeAutomation.DeviceType","text":"lights","offset":12,"length":6,"confidenceScore":1,"extraInformation":[{"extraInformationKind":"ListKey","key":"light"}]}]}}}.
```

> [!NOTE]
> Support for the JSON response for CLU via the LanguageUnderstandingServiceResponse_JsonResult property was added in the Speech SDK version 1.26.

The intents are returned in the probability order of most likely to least likely. Here's a formatted version of the JSON output where the `topIntent` is `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` with a confidence score of 0.97712576 (97.71%). The second most likely intent might be `HomeAutomation.TurnOff` with a confidence score of 0.8985081 (84.31%).

```json
{
  "kind": "ConversationResult",
  "result": {
    "query": "turn on the lights",
    "prediction": {
      "topIntent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
      "projectKind": "Conversation",
      "intents": [
        {
          "category": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
          "confidenceScore": 0.97712576
        },
        {
          "category": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
          "confidenceScore": 0.8431633
        },
        {
          "category": "None",
          "confidenceScore": 0.782861
        }
      ],
      "entities": [
        {
          "category": "HomeAutomation.DeviceType",
          "text": "lights",
          "offset": 12,
          "length": 6,
          "confidenceScore": 1,
          "extraInformation": [
            {
              "extraInformationKind": "ListKey",
              "key": "light"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Remarks
Now that you've completed the quickstart, here are some additional considerations:

- This example uses the `RecognizeOnceAsync` operation to transcribe utterances of up to 30 seconds, or until silence is detected. For information about continuous recognition for longer audio, including multi-lingual conversations, see [How to recognize speech](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-recognize-speech.md).
- To recognize speech from an audio file, use `FromWavFileInput` instead of `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput`:
    ```csharp
    using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
    ```
- For compressed audio files such as MP4, install GStreamer and use `PullAudioInputStream` or `PushAudioInputStream`. For more information, see [How to use compressed input audio](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md).
