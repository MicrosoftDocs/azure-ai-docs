## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites.md)]

## Set up the environment

Before you can do anything, you need to install the Speech SDK for JavaScript. If you just want the package name to install, run `npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk`. For guided installation instructions, see the [SDK installation guide](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).

## Create captions from speech

Follow these steps to build and run the captioning quickstart code example.

1. Copy the <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/scenarios/javascript/node/captioning/"  title="Copy the samples"  target="_blank">scenarios/javascript/node/captioning/</a> sample files from GitHub into your project directory.
1. Open a command prompt in the same directory as `Captioning.js`.
1. Install the Speech SDK for JavaScript:
    ```console
    npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk
    ```
1. Run the application with your preferred command line arguments. See [usage and arguments](#usage-and-arguments) for the available options. Here is an example:
    ```console
    node captioning.js --key YourSubscriptionKey --region YourServiceRegion --input caption.this.wav --output caption.output.txt --srt --recognizing --threshold 5 --profanity mask --phrases "Contoso;Jessie;Rehaan"
    ```
    Replace `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech resource key, and replace `YourServiceRegion` with your Speech resource [region](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/regions.md), such as `westus` or `northeurope`. Make sure that the paths specified by `--input` and `--output` are valid. Otherwise you must change the paths.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Speech SDK for JavaScript doesn't support [compressed input audio](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md). You must use a WAV file as shown in the example.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../../use-key-vault.md). See the Azure AI services [security](../../../../security-features.md) article for more information.
