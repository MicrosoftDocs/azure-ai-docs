[!INCLUDE [Introduction](intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites.md)]

## Set up the environment

[!INCLUDE [SPX Setup](../../spx-setup-quick.md)]

You must also install [GStreamer](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md) for compressed input audio.

## Create captions from speech

With the [Speech CLI](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/spx-overview.md), you can output both SRT (SubRip Text) and WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) captions from any type of media that contains audio. 

To recognize audio from a file and output both WebVtt (`vtt`) and SRT (`srt`) captions, follow these steps. 

1. Make sure that you have an input file named `caption.this.mp4` in the path.
1. Run the following command to output captions from the video file:
    ```console
    spx recognize --file caption.this.mp4 --format any --output vtt file - --output srt file - --output each file - @output.each.detailed --property SpeechServiceResponse_StablePartialResultThreshold=5 --profanity masked --phrases "Constoso;Jessie;Rehaan"
    ```

    The SRT and WebVTT captions are output to the console as shown here:
    
    ```console
    1
    00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,230
    Welcome to applied Mathematics course 201.
    WEBVTT
    
    00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.230
    Welcome to applied Mathematics course 201.
    {
      "ResultId": "561a0ea00cc14bb09bd294357df3270f",
      "Duration": "00:00:03.0500000"
    }
    ```

## Usage and arguments

Here are details about the optional arguments from the previous command:

- `--file caption.this.mp4 --format any`: Input audio from file. The default input is the microphone. For compressed audio files such as MP4, install GStreamer and see [How to use compressed input audio](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md).
- `--output vtt file -` and `--output srt file -`: Outputs WebVTT and SRT captions to standard output. For more information about SRT and WebVTT caption file formats, see [Caption output format](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/captioning-concepts.md#caption-output-format). For more information about the `--output` argument, see [Speech CLI output options](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/spx-output-options.md).
- `@output.each.detailed`: Outputs event results with text, offset, and duration. For more information, see [Get speech recognition results](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/get-speech-recognition-results.md).
- `--property SpeechServiceResponse_StablePartialResultThreshold=5`: You can request that the Speech service return fewer `Recognizing` events that are more accurate. In this example, the Speech service must affirm recognition of a word at least five times before returning the partial results to you. For more information, see [Get partial results](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/captioning-concepts.md#get-partial-results) concepts.
- `--profanity masked`: You can specify whether to mask, remove, or show profanity in recognition results. For more information, see [Profanity filter](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/display-text-format.md#profanity-filter) concepts.
- `--phrases "Constoso;Jessie;Rehaan"`: You can specify a list of phrases to be recognized, such as Contoso, Jessie, and Rehaan. For more information, see [Improve recognition with phrase list](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/improve-accuracy-phrase-list.md).
