Input options include:

- `--input FILE`: Input audio from file. The default input is the microphone. 
- `--format FORMAT`: Use compressed audio format. Valid only with `--file`. Valid values are `alaw`, `any`, `flac`, `mp3`, `mulaw`, and `ogg_opus`. The default value is `any`. To use a `wav` file, don't specify the format. This option is not available with the JavaScript captioning sample. For compressed audio files such as MP4, install GStreamer and see [How to use compressed input audio](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md). 

Language options include:

- `--language LANG`: Specify a language using one of the corresponding [supported locales](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-support.md?tabs=stt). This is used when breaking captions into lines. Default value is `en-US`.

Recognition options include:

- `--offline`: Output offline results. Overrides `--realTime`. Default output mode is offline.
- `--realTime`: Output real-time results. 

Real-time output includes `Recognizing` event results. The default offline output is `Recognized` event results only. These are always written to the console, never to an output file. The `--quiet` option overrides this. For more information, see [Get speech recognition results](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/get-speech-recognition-results.md).

Accuracy options include:

- `--phrases PHRASE1;PHRASE2`: You can specify a list of phrases to be recognized, such as `Contoso;Jessie;Rehaan`. For more information, see [Improve recognition with phrase list](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/improve-accuracy-phrase-list.md).

Output options include:

- `--help`: Show this help and stop
- `--output FILE`: Output captions to the specified `file`. This flag is required.
- `--srt`: Output captions in SRT (SubRip Text) format. The default format is WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks). For more information about SRT and WebVTT caption file formats, see [Caption output format](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/captioning-concepts.md#caption-output-format).
- `--maxLineLength LENGTH`: Set the maximum number of characters per line for a caption to LENGTH. Minimum is 20. Default is 37 (30 for Chinese).
- `--lines LINES`: Set the number of lines for a caption to LINES. Minimum is 1. Default is 2.
- `--delay MILLISECONDS`: How many MILLISECONDS to delay the display of each caption, to mimic a real-time experience. This option is only applicable when you use the `realTime` flag. Minimum is 0.0. Default is 1000.
- `--remainTime MILLISECONDS`: How many MILLISECONDS a caption should remain on screen if it is not replaced by another. Minimum is 0.0. Default is 1000.
- `--quiet`: Suppress console output, except errors.
- `--profanity OPTION`: Valid values: raw, remove, mask. For more information, see [Profanity filter](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/display-text-format.md#profanity-filter) concepts.
- `--threshold NUMBER`: Set stable partial result threshold. The default value is `3`. This option is only applicable when you use the `realTime` flag. For more information, see [Get partial results](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/captioning-concepts.md#get-partial-results) concepts.
