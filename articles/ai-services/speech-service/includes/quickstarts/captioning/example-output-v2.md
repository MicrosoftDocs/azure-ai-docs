When you use the `realTime` option in the example above, the partial results from `Recognizing` events are included in the output. In this example, only the final `Recognized` event includes the commas. Commas aren't the only differences between `Recognizing` and `Recognized` events. For more information, see [Get partial results](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/captioning-concepts.md#get-partial-results).

When you use the `--offline` option, the results are stable from the final `Recognized` event. Partial results aren't included in the output:

orange, yellow, green, blue,

The [SRT](https://docs.fileformat.com/video/srt/) (SubRip Text) timespan output format is `hh:mm:ss,fff`. For more information, see [Caption output format](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/captioning-concepts.md#caption-output-format).
