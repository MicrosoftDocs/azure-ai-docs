You can create and run an application to use voice live with agents for real-time voice agents.

- Using agents allows leveraging a built-in prompt and configuration managed within the agent itself, rather than specifying instructions in the session code. 

- Agents encapsulate more complex logic and behaviors, making it easier to manage and update conversational flows without changing the client code. 

- The agent approach streamlines integration. The agent ID is used to connect and all necessary settings are handled internally, reducing the need for manual configuration in the code. 

- This separation also supports better maintainability and scalability for scenarios where multiple conversational experiences or business logic variations are needed.

To instead use the Voice live API without agents, see the [Voice live API quickstart](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live-quickstart).
