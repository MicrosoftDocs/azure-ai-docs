In this article, you learn how to use voice live with [Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview) and [Azure AI Speech](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/overview) in the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).

[!INCLUDE [Introduction](intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- An [Azure AI Foundry resource](../../../../multi-service-resource.md) created in one of the supported regions. For more information about region availability, see the [voice live overview documentation](../../../voice-live.md).
- An Azure AI Foundry agent created in the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs). For more information about creating an agent, see the [Create an agent quickstart](/azure/ai-foundry/agents/quickstart).

> [!TIP]
> To use voice live, you don't need to deploy an audio model with your Azure AI Foundry resource. Voice live is fully managed, and the model is automatically deployed for you. For more information about models availability, see the [voice live overview documentation](../../../voice-live.md).
