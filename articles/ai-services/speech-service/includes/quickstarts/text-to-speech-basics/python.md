[!INCLUDE [Introduction](intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites-resourcekey-endpoint.md)]

## Set up the environment

The Speech SDK for Python is available as a [Python Package Index (PyPI) module](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/). The Speech SDK for Python is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- On Windows, install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170&preserve-view=true) for your platform. Installing this package might require a restart.
- On Linux, you must use the x64 target architecture.

Install a version of [Python from 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For any requirements, see [Install the Speech SDK](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-python).

### Set environment variables

[!INCLUDE [Environment variables](../../common/environment-variables-resourcekey-endpoint.md)]

## Create the application

Follow these steps to create a console application.

1. Open a command prompt window in the folder where you want the new project. Create a file named *speech_synthesis.py*.
1. Run this command to install the Speech SDK:  

   ```console
   pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech
   ```

1. Copy the following code into *speech_synthesis.py*:

    ```Python
    import os
    import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

    # This example requires environment variables named "SPEECH_KEY" and "ENDPOINT"
    # Replace with your own subscription key and endpoint, the endpoint is like : "https://YourServiceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
    speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(subscription=os.environ.get('SPEECH_KEY'), endpoint=os.environ.get('ENDPOINT'))
    audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioOutputConfig(use_default_speaker=True)

    # The neural multilingual voice can speak different languages based on the input text.
    speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name='en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural'

    speech_synthesizer = speechsdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_config)

    # Get text from the console and synthesize to the default speaker.
    print("Enter some text that you want to speak >")
    text = input()

    speech_synthesis_result = speech_synthesizer.speak_text_async(text).get()

    if speech_synthesis_result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.SynthesizingAudioCompleted:
        print("Speech synthesized for text [{}]".format(text))
    elif speech_synthesis_result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.Canceled:
        cancellation_details = speech_synthesis_result.cancellation_details
        print("Speech synthesis canceled: {}".format(cancellation_details.reason))
        if cancellation_details.reason == speechsdk.CancellationReason.Error:
            if cancellation_details.error_details:
                print("Error details: {}".format(cancellation_details.error_details))
                print("Did you set the speech resource key and endpoint values?")
    ```

1. To change the speech synthesis language, replace `en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural` with another [supported voice](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-support.md#standard-voices).

   All neural voices are multilingual and fluent in their own language and English. For example, if the input text in English is *I'm excited to try text to speech* and you set `es-ES-ElviraNeural`, the text is spoken in English with a Spanish accent. If the voice doesn't speak the language of the input text, the Speech service doesn't output synthesized audio.

1. Run your new console application to start speech synthesis to the default speaker.

   ```console
   python speech_synthesis.py
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure that you set the `SPEECH_KEY` and `ENDPOINT` [environment variables](#set-environment-variables). If you don't set these variables, the sample fails with an error message.

1. Enter some text that you want to speak. For example, type *I'm excited to try text to speech*. Select the **Enter** key to hear the synthesized speech.

   ```console
   Enter some text that you want to speak > 
   I'm excited to try text to speech
   ```

## Remarks

### More speech synthesis options

This quickstart uses the `speak_text_async` operation to synthesize a short block of text that you enter. You can also use long-form text from a file and get finer control over voice styles, prosody, and other settings.

- See [how to synthesize speech](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-speech-synthesis.md) and [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) overview](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup.md) for information about speech synthesis from a file and finer control over voice styles, prosody, and other settings.
- See [batch synthesis API for text to speech](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/batch-synthesis.md) for information about synthesizing long-form text to speech.

### OpenAI text to speech voices in Azure AI Speech

OpenAI text to speech voices are also supported. See [OpenAI text to speech voices in Azure AI Speech](../../../openai-voices.md) and [multilingual voices](../../../language-support.md?tabs=tts#multilingual-voices). You can replace `en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural` with a supported OpenAI voice name such as `en-US-FableMultilingualNeural`.
