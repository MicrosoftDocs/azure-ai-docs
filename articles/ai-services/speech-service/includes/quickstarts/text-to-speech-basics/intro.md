With Azure AI Speech, you can run an application that synthesizes a human-like voice to read text. You can change the voice, enter text to be spoken, and listen to the output on your computer's speaker.

> [!TIP]
> You can try text to speech in the [Speech Studio Voice Gallery](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/voicegallery) without signing up or writing any code.

> [!TIP]
> Try out the [Azure AI Speech Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azureaispeech.azure-ai-speech-toolkit) to easily build and run samples on Visual Studio Code.
