The console output shows the full conversation and summary. Here's an example of the overall summary, with redactions for brevity:

```output
Conversation summary:
    issue: Customer wants to sign up for insurance.
    resolution: Customer was advised that customer would be contacted by the insurance company.
```

If you specify the `--output FILE` optional [argument](../../../call-center-quickstart.md#usage-and-arguments), a JSON version of the results are written to the file. The file output is a combination of the JSON responses from the [batch transcription](../../../batch-transcription.md) (Speech), [sentiment](../../../../language-service/sentiment-opinion-mining/overview.md) (Language), and [conversation summarization](../../../../language-service/summarization/overview.md?tabs=conversation-summarization) (Language) APIs. 

The `transcription` property contains a JSON object with the results of sentiment analysis merged with batch transcription. Here's an example, with redactions for brevity:
```json

    "source": "https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/raw/master/scenarios/call-center/sampledata/Call1_separated_16k_health_insurance.wav",

}   
```

The `conversationAnalyticsResults` property contains a JSON object with the results of the conversation PII and conversation summarization analysis. Here's an example, with redactions for brevity:
