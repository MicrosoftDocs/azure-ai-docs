To complete the intent recognition quickstart, you'll need to create a LUIS account and a project using the LUIS preview portal. This quickstart requires a LUIS subscription [in a region where intent recognition is available](../../../regions.md#regions). A Speech service subscription isn't required.

The first thing you'll need to do is create a LUIS account and app using the LUIS preview portal. The LUIS app that you create will use a prebuilt domain for home automation, which provides intents, entities, and example utterances. When you're finished, you'll have a LUIS endpoint running in the cloud that you can call using the Speech SDK. 

Follow these instructions to create your LUIS app:

* <a href="../../../..//luis/luis-get-started-create-app.md" target="_blank">Quickstart: Build prebuilt domain app </a>

When you're done, you'll need four things:

* Re-publish with **Speech priming** toggled on
* Your LUIS **Primary key**
* Your LUIS **Location**
* Your LUIS **App ID**

Here's where you can find this information in the [LUIS preview portal](https://preview.luis.ai/):

1. From the LUIS preview portal, select your app then select the **Publish** button.

2. Select the **Production** slot, if you're using `en-US` select **change settings**, and toggle the **Speech priming** option to the **On** position. Then select the **Publish** button.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > **Speech priming** is highly recommended as it will improve speech recognition accuracy.

3. From the LUIS preview portal, select **Manage**, then select **Azure Resources**. On this page, you'll find your LUIS key and location (sometimes referred to as _region_) for your LUIS prediction resource.

4. After you've got your key and location, you'll need the app ID. Select **Settings**. your app ID is available on this page.
