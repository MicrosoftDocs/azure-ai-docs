    1. Type in a name (e.g. The host).
    1. Select a language (e.g. English).
    1. Select the **Enter** button.
    1. Note the conversation code at the top of the page.

    > If you use the copy button on the web page, make sure you remove the `translate.it/` at the start. You only need the 5 character conversation ID (example: ABCDE).
