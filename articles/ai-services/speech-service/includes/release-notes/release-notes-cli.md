- We decreased the size of the .NET tool install.

#### COVID-19 abridged testing

As the ongoing pandemic continues to require our engineers to work from home, pre-pandemic manual verification scripts are reduced to test on fewer devices with fewer configurations, and the likelihood of environment-specific bugs slipping through may be increased. We still rigorously validate with a large set of automation. In the unlikely event that we missed something let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).<br>
Stay healthy!

- Added URL checking and error message for content field in batch transcription create.

#### COVID-19 abridged testing
Due to working remotely over the last few weeks, we couldn't do as much manual verification testing as we normally do. We haven't made any changes we think could have broken anything, and our automated tests all passed. In the unlikely event that we missed something let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).<br>
