### October 2024 release

##### Prebuilt neural voice

Introduced 4 turbo version of Azure OpenAI voices in public preview: `en-US-EchoTurboMultilingualNeural`, `en-US-FableTurboMultilingualNeural`, `en-US-OnyxTurboMultilingualNeural`, and `en-US-ShimmerTurboMultilingualNeural`. Turbo version of Azure OpenAI voices has the similar voice persona as Azure OpenAI voices but supports extra features. Turbo voices support the full set of SSML elements and more features like word boundary, just like other Azure AI Speech voices. See the [full language and voice list](../../language-support.md?tabs=tts) for more information.

These voices are now generally available:

| **Locale (BCP-47)** | **Voice name**              |

#### Prebuilt high definition (HD) neural voice

Azure AI speech high definition (HD) voices are available in public preview. The HD voices can understand the content, automatically detect emotions in the input text, and adjust the speaking tone in real-time to match the sentiment. HD voices maintain a consistent voice persona from their neural (and non HD) counterparts, and deliver even more value through enhanced features. For more information, see [What are Azure AI Speech high definition (HD) voices?](../../high-definition-voices.md).

#### Prebuilt Neural TTS Voices

Introducing new `en-US` gender neutral voice for public preview:

| Locale (BCP-47) | Language | Text to speech voices |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `en-US` | English (United States) | `en-US-BlueNeural` (Neutral) |

Introducing new multilingual voices for public preview:

| Locale (BCP-47) | Language | Text to speech voices |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `en-US` | English (United States) | `en-US-JennyMultilingualV2Neural` (Female) |
| `en-US` | English (United States) | `en-US-RyanMultilingualNeural` (Male) |

The multilingual voices `en-US-JennyMultilingualV2Neural` and `en-US-RyanMultilingualNeural` auto-detect the language of the input text. However, you can still use the `<lang>` element to adjust the speaking language for these voices.

These new multilingual voices can speak in 41 languages and accents: `Arabic (Egypt)`, `Arabic (Saudi Arabia)`, `Catalan`, `Czech (Czechia)`, `Danish (Denmark)`, `German (Austria)`, `German (Switzerland)`, `German (Germany)`, `English (Australia)`, `English (Canada)`, `English (United Kingdom)`, `English (Hong Kong SAR)`, `English (Ireland)`, `English (India)`, `English (United States)`, `Spanish (Spain)`, `Spanish (Mexico)`, `Finnish (Finland)`, `French (Belgium)`, `French (Canada)`, `French (Switzerland)`, `French (France)`, `Hindi (India)`, `Hungarian (Hungary)`, `Indonesian (Indonesia)`, `Italian (Italy)`, `Japanese (Japan)`, `Korean (Korea)`, `Norwegian Bokmål (Norway)`, `Dutch (Belgium)`, `Dutch (Netherlands)`, `Polish (Poland)`, `Portuguese (Brazil)`, `Portuguese (Portugal)`, `Russian (Russia)`, `Swedish (Sweden)`, `Thai (Thailand)`, `Turkish (Türkiye)`, `Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified)`, `Chinese (Cantonese, Traditional)`, `Chinese (Taiwanese Mandarin, Traditional)`.

These multilingual voices don't fully support certain SSML elements, such as break, emphasis, silence, and sub.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `en-US-JennyMultilingualV2Neural` voice is provided temporarily in public preview soley for evaluation purposes. It will be removed in the future. 
> 
> In order to speak in a language other than English, the current implementation of the `en-US-JennyMultilingualNeural` voice requires that you set the `<lang xml:lang>` element. We anticipate that during Q4 calendar year 2023, the `en-US-JennyMultilingualNeural` voice will be updated to speak in the language of the input text without the `<lang xml:lang>` element. This will be in parity with the `en-US-JennyMultilingualV2Neural` voice.

Introducing new features in public preview for below voices:
- Added Latin input for Serbian (Serbia) `sr-RS` voices: `sr-latn-RS-SophieNeural` and `sr-latn-RS-NicholasNeural`.
