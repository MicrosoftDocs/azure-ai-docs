[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](../../../../includes/preview-feature.md)]

In this article, you learn how to use video translation with Azure AI Speech in the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).

> [!TIP]
> Try out video translation in the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) before using the API. Use the [video translation REST API](?pivots=rest-api) to integrate video translation into your applications. For more information about the API, see [Video translation REST API](/rest/api/aiservices/videotranslation/translation-operations/create-translation).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.
- an AI Foundry resource for Speech [in a supported region](../../../video-translation-overview.md#supported-regions-and-languages). If you don't have a Speech resource, create one in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- An [Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview) account. 
- You need a video file in .mp4 format, less than 5 GB, and shorter than 4 hours. For testing purposes, you can use the sample video file provided by Microsoft at [https://ai.azure.com/speechassetscache/ttsvoice/VideoTranslation/PublicDoc/SampleData/es-ES-TryOutOriginal.mp4](https://ai.azure.com/speechassetscache/ttsvoice/VideoTranslation/PublicDoc/SampleData/es-ES-TryOutOriginal.mp4).
- Make sure video translation supports your [source and target language](../../../language-support.md?tabs=speech-translation#video-translation).

## Try out video translation

To try out the video translation demo, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [model catalog in Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models). 
   
1. Enter and search for "Azure-AI-Speech" in the catalog search box.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/search-model-catalog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the model catalog in Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/search-model-catalog.png":::

1. Select **Azure-AI-Speech** and you're taken to the **Azure-AI-Speech** try out page.
1. Select **Speech capabilities by scenario** > **Video translation**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/capabilities-by-scenario.png" alt-text="Screenshot of filtering Speech service capabilities by scenario." lightbox="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/capabilities-by-scenario.png":::

1. Under the **Sample option** to the right, select personal or standard voice.

1. Select the **Play** button to hear the translated audio. Select the original video tab to play the original audio.

   The voice type options are:
   - **Standard voice**: The service automatically selects the most suitable standard voice by matching the speaker's voice in the video with standard voices.
   - **Personal voice**: Use the personal voice that matches the voice of the speakers in the video. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > To use personal voice via the API, you need to apply for [access](https://aka.ms/customneural).

1. Upload your video file by dragging and dropping the video file or selecting the file manually. The video must be in .mp4 format, less than 5 GB, and shorter than 4 hours.
   
1. Provide the **Number of speakers**, **Language of the video**, and **Translate to** language.

1. Select the boxes to acknowledge the pricing information and code of conduct. 

1. Select **Next: Advanced settings** if you want to adjust the advanced settings. 

    :::image type="content" source="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/provide-video-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot of providing video information on the new project page." lightbox="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/provide-video-information.png":::

1. Optionally, you can adjust the following settings:

    - **Lexicon file**: This option allows you to add custom words or phrases that the system should recognize and pronounce correctly. You can create a lexicon file in the [audio content creation tool in the Speech Studio](https://aka.ms/speechstudio) and select it here. 
    - **Burn subtitles**: This option allows you to add subtitles to the video. The subtitle file can be in WebVTT or JSON format. You can download a sample WebVTT file for your reference by selecting **Download sample VTT file**.
   
    :::image type="content" source="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/provide-video-information-advanced.png" alt-text="Screenshot of providing lexicon and subtitle information while creating a new project." lightbox="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/provide-video-information-advanced.png":::

   If you want to use your own subtitle files, select **Subtitle** > **Upload your own**. You can choose to upload either the source subtitle file or the target subtitle file. 
   - Automatic subtitles: Results in both source and target language subtitles.
   - Upload source language subtitles: Results in both source and target language subtitles.
   - Upload target language subtitles: Results in only target language subtitles.

1. Select **Create**.

Once the upload to Azure Blob Storage is complete, you can check the processing status on the project tab.

After the project is created, you can select the project to review detailed settings and make adjustments according to your preferences.

## Check and adjust voice settings

Select **My videos** and you should see a video labeled with **Succeeded** status. 

:::image type="content" source="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/select-succeeded-video.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a successfully translated video." lightbox="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/select-succeeded-video.png":::

Select the video to see the **Translated** and **Original** tabs under **Video**. You can compare the original and translated videos by selecting the corresponding tab. The translated video is generated automatically, and you can play it to check the translation quality. 

:::image type="content" source="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/compare-original-translated-custom.png" alt-text="Screenshot of reviewing details of the translated video." lightbox="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/compare-original-translated-custom.png":::

To the right side of the video, you can view both the original script and the translated script. Hovering over each part of the original script triggers the video to automatically jump to the corresponding segment of the original video, while hovering over each part of the translated script triggers the video to jump to the corresponding translated segment.

You can make multiple changes to the video, including adjusting the voice settings, adding or removing segments, and changing the time frame of the scripts. You're only charged after you select **Apply changes** to apply your changes. You can select **Save** to save work in progress without incurring any charges.

If you encounter segments with an "unidentified" voice name, it might be because the system couldn't accurately detect the voice, especially in situations where speaker voices overlap. In such cases, it's advisable to manually change the voice name.  

:::image type="content" source="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/voice-unidentified.png" alt-text="Screenshot of one segment with unidentified voice name." lightbox="../../../media/video-translation/foundry-portal/voice-unidentified.png":::

## Translate to another language

You can keep the current translation project and translate the original video into another language.

1. Select **My videos** and then select the tile for your video translation. 
1. Select **+ New language**. 
1. On the new **Translate to new language** page that appears, choose a new translation language and voice type. Once the video is translated, a new project is automatically created.
