The video translation REST API facilitates seamless video translation integration into your applications. It supports uploading, managing, and refining video translations, with multiple iterations for continuous improvement. In this article, you learn how to utilize video translation through the REST API. 

## Pre-requisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.
- A Speech resource [in a supported region](../../../video-translation-overview.md#supported-regions-and-languages). If you don't have a Speech resource, create one in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- You need a video file in .mp4 format, less than 500 MB, and shorter than 60 minutes. For testing purposes, you can use the sample video file provided by Microsoft at [https://speechstudioprodpublicsa.blob.core.windows.net/ttsvoice/VideoTranslation/PublicDoc/SampleData/es-ES-TryOutOriginal.mp4](https://speechstudioprodpublicsa.blob.core.windows.net/ttsvoice/VideoTranslation/PublicDoc/SampleData/es-ES-TryOutOriginal.mp4).
- Make sure video translation supports your [source and target language](../../../language-support.md?tabs=speech-translation#video-translation).

> [!TIP]
> Before you start, see the [video translation overview](../../../video-translation-overview.md#how-it-works) to understand the end-to-end process of video translation. 

## Workflow

Here are the steps to get a translated video using the REST API:
1. [Create a translation object](#step-1-create-a-translation). Check the status of the operation periodically until it reaches `Succeeded` or `Failed`.
1. [Create an iteration](#step-2-create-an-iteration) to start the translation process. Check the status of the iteration operation periodically until it reaches `Succeeded` or `Failed`.
1. [Download](#step-3-download-the-translated-video-and-subtitles) the translated video and subtitles.
1. Optionally, [create additional iterations](#step-4-create-additional-iterations-optional) to improve the translation quality.

## Step 1: Create a translation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating a translation as described in this section doesn't initiate the translation process. You can start translating the video by [creating an iteration](#step-2-create-an-iteration). Translations and iterations created through the REST API aren't synchronized to the portal, and vice versa.

To create a video translation, you need to construct an HTTP PUT request path and body according to the following instructions: 

- Specify `displayName`: The display name of the translation. This is a user-friendly name that helps you identify the translation.
- Specify `description`: A brief description of the translation. This is optional but can be helpful for documentation purposes.
- Specify the `sourceLocale`: The language of the original video. This is the language spoken in the video file.
- Specify the `targetLocale`: The language you want to translate the video into. This is the target language for the translation.
- Specify `voiceKind`: The type of voice you want to use for the translation. You can choose between `PlatformVoice` and `PersonalVoice`. For `PlatformVoice`, the system automatically selects the most suitable prebuilt voice by matching the speaker's voice in the video with prebuilt voices. For `PersonalVoice`, the system offers a model that generates high-quality voice replication in a few seconds.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To use personal voice, you need to apply for [access](https://aka.ms/customneural).

- Specify `speakerCount`: The number of speakers in the video. This is an optional parameter, and you can set it to 1 if you're unsure.
- Specify `subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment`: The maximum number of characters allowed per subtitle segment. This is an optional parameter, and you can set it to 30 if you're unsure.
- Specify `exportSubtitleInVideo`: A boolean value indicating whether to export subtitles in the video. This is an optional parameter, and you can set it to `true` if you want to include subtitles in the video.
- Specify the `videoFileUrl`: The URL of the video file you want to translate. The video must be in .mp4 format, less than 500 MB, and shorter than 60 minutes. You can upload the video to Azure Blob Storage and use the Blob URL. For testing purposes, you can use the sample video file provided by Microsoft at [https://speechstudioprodpublicsa.blob.core.windows.net/ttsvoice/VideoTranslation/PublicDoc/SampleData/es-ES-TryOutOriginal.mp4](https://speechstudioprodpublicsa.blob.core.windows.net/ttsvoice/VideoTranslation/PublicDoc/SampleData/es-ES-TryOutOriginal.mp4).

For authentication and authorization, you need to include the following headers and path IDs in your request:
- Set the `Operation-Id` header: The `Operation-Id` must be unique for each operation, such as creating each iteration. Replace `Your-Operation-Id` with a unique ID for this operation.
- Replace `Your-Translation-Id` in the path. The translation ID must be unique among all translations for the Speech resource. Replace `Your-Translation-Id` with a translation ID of your choice. You use this ID to refer to the translation in subsequent API calls.
- Replace `YourSpeechResourceKey` with your Speech resource key and replace `YourSpeechResourceRegion` with your Speech resource region. 

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X PUT -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechResourceKey" -H "Operation-Id: Your-Operation-Id-1" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "displayName": "My translation object",
  "description": "My translation object for video translation iterations",
  "input": {
    "sourceLocale": "es-ES",
    "targetLocale": "en-US",
    "voiceKind": "PlatformVoice",
    "speakerCount": 1,
    "subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment": 50,
    "exportSubtitleInVideo": false,
    "videoFileUrl": "https://speechstudioprodpublicsa.blob.core.windows.net/ttsvoice/VideoTranslation/PublicDoc/SampleData/es-ES-TryOutOriginal.mp4"
  }
}' "https://YourSpeechResourceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/videotranslation/translations/Your-Translation-Id?api-version=2024-05-20-preview"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you try to use an existing translation ID with different settings, the API will return an error. The translation ID must be unique for each translation. You can make changes to an existing translation by [creating an iteration](#step-2-create-an-iteration).

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "sourceLocale": "es-ES",
    "targetLocale": "en-US",
    "voiceKind": "PlatformVoice",
    "speakerCount": 1,
    "subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment": 50,
    "exportSubtitleInVideo": false
  },
  "status": "NotStarted",
  "lastActionDateTime": "2025-03-06T19:13:35.669Z",
  "id": "Your-Translation-Id",
  "displayName": "My translation object",
  "description": "My translation object for video translation iterations",
  "createdDateTime": "2025-03-06T19:13:35.669Z"
}
```

You can use the operation ID that you specified and use the [Get operation by operation ID](#get-operation-by-operation-id) API periodically until the returned status is `Succeeded` or `Failed`. This operation allows you to monitor the progress of your creating the iteration process. The status property should progress from `NotStarted` to `Running`, and finally to `Succeeded` or `Failed`. 

## Step 2: Create an iteration

To start translating your video or update an iteration for an existing translation, you need to construct an HTTP PUT request path and body according to the following instructions:

- Set the required input: Include details like `speakerCount`, `subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment`,`exportSubtitleInVideo`, or `webvttFile`. No subtitles are embedded in the output video by default. When creating an iteration, if you already specified the optional parameters `speakerCount`, `subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment`, and `exportSubtitleInVideo` during the creation of translation, you donâ€™t need to specify them again. The values inherit from translation settings. Once these parameters are defined when creating an iteration, the new values override the original settings. 
- Optionally, you can specify a WebVTT file with subtitles for your original video. The `webvttFile` input parameter isn't required when creating the first iteration. However, [starting from the second iteration](#step-4-create-additional-iterations-optional), you must specify the `webvttFile` parameter in the iteration process.

For authentication and authorization, you need to include the following headers and path IDs in your request:
- Set the `Operation-Id` header: The `Operation-Id` must be unique for each operation, such as creating each iteration. Replace `Your-Operation-Id` with a unique ID for this operation.
- Replace `Your-Translation-Id` in the path. Use the same translation ID that you specified when you [created the translation](#step-1-create-a-translation). The translation ID remains unchanged.
- Specify a new `iterationId` in the path. The iteration ID must be unique for each operation. Replace `Your-Iteration-Id-1` with an iteration ID of your choice.
- Replace `YourSpeechResourceKey` with your Speech resource key and replace `YourSpeechResourceRegion` with your Speech resource region. 

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X PUT -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechResourceKey" \
-H "Operation-Id: Your-Operation-Id" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "input": {
    "subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment": 30,
    "exportSubtitleInVideo": true
  }
}' "https://YourSpeechResourceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/videotranslation/translations/Your-Translation-Id/iterations/Your-Iteration-Id-1?api-version=2024-05-20-preview"
```

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment": 30,
    "exportSubtitleInVideo": true
  },
  "status": "NotStarted",
  "lastActionDateTime": "2025-03-06T19:15:38.722Z",
  "id": "Your-Iteration-Id",
  "createdDateTime": "2025-03-06T19:15:38.722Z"
}
```

You can use the operation ID that you specified and use the [Get operation by operation ID](#get-operation-by-operation-id) API periodically until the returned status is `Succeeded` or `Failed`. This operation allows you to monitor the progress of your creating the iteration process. The status property should progress from `NotStarted` to `Running`, and finally to `Succeeded` or `Failed`. 

## Step 3: Download the translated video and subtitles

You can download the translated video and subtitles once the iteration status is `Succeeded`. The translated video and subtitles are available in the response body of the [Get an iteration by iteration ID](/rest/api/aiservices/videotranslation/iteration-operations/get-iteration) API.

To retrieve details of a specific iteration by its ID, use the HTTP GET request. Replace `YourSpeechResourceKey` with your Speech resource key,  `YourSpeechResourceRegion` with your Speech resource region, `Your-Translation-Id` with the translation ID you want to check,  and `Your-Iteration-Id` with the iteration ID you want to check.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X GET -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechResourceKey" "https://YourSpeechResourceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/videotranslation/translations/Your-Translation-Id/iterations/Your-Iteration-Id?api-version=2024-05-20-preview"  
```

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "speakerCount": 1,
    "subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment": 30,
    "exportSubtitleInVideo": true
  },
  "result": {
    "translatedVideoFileUrl": "https://cvoiceprodeus.blob.core.windows.net/YourTranslatedVideoFileUrl",
    "sourceLocaleSubtitleWebvttFileUrl": "https://cvoiceprodeus.blob.core.windows.net/YourSourceLocaleSubtitleWebvttFileUrl",
    "targetLocaleSubtitleWebvttFileUrl": "https://cvoiceprodeus.blob.core.windows.net/YourTargetLocaleSubtitleWebvttFileUrl",
    "metadataJsonWebvttFileUrl": "https://cvoiceprodeus.blob.core.windows.net/YourMetadataJsonWebvttFileUrl",
  },
  "status": "Succeeded",
  "lastActionDateTime": "2025-03-06T19:17:06.270Z",
  "id": "Your-Iteration-Id-7",
  "createdDateTime": "2025-03-06T19:15:38.723Z"
}
```

### Download from the result URLs

The response body contains the following URLs for downloading the translated video and subtitles:
- `translatedVideoFileUrl`: The URL of the translated video file. You can download the translated video from this URL.
- `sourceLocaleSubtitleWebvttFileUrl`: The URL of the WebVTT file for the source locale. You can download the WebVTT file from this URL.
- `targetLocaleSubtitleWebvttFileUrl`: The URL of the WebVTT file for the target locale. You can download the WebVTT file from this URL.
- `metadataJsonWebvttFileUrl`: The URL of the metadata JSON WebVTT file. You can download the metadata JSON WebVTT file from this URL.

Here are examples of the formats for the subtitle files:

The WebVTT file with JSON properties contains metadata about the translation process. Each subtitle segment includes properties that provide additional information about the translation. Here's a breakdown of the properties:
- `globalMetadata`: This section contains metadata about the speakers in the video. The "speakers" property is an object that contains information about each speaker. Each speaker is identified by a unique ID (e.g., "Speaker0"). The "defaultSsmlProperties" property contains the default SSML properties for the speaker's voice.
- `id`: This is a unique identifier for each subtitle segment. It helps to identify the specific segment of text in the WebVTT file.
- `speakerId`: This property indicates the ID of the speaker for the corresponding subtitle segment. It should match the speaker ID defined in the "globalMetadata" section.
- `ssmlProperties`: This section contains properties related to the speaker's voice. It can include properties like "voiceName" and "voiceKind". The "voiceName" is the name of the voice used for synthesis, and the "voiceKind" indicates whether it's a platform voice or a personal voice.
- `sourceLocaleText`: This property contains the original text in the source language. If you only make changes to `sourceLocaleText`, the system will translate the updated `sourceLocaleText` and use the new translation for synthesis. If you make changes to both `sourceLocaleText` and `translatedText`, the system will ignore the changes to `sourceLocaleText` and use the updated `translatedText` for synthesis.
- `translatedText`: This property contains the translated text in the target language. It represents the text that will be synthesized in the translated video. If you only make changes to `translatedText`, the system will use the updated translatedText for synthesis.


## Step 4: Create additional iterations (Optional)

You can create additional iterations to improve the translation quality. The process is similar to creating the first iteration. 

The `webvttFile` parameter isn't required when creating the first iteration. However, starting from the second iteration, you must specify the `webvttFile` parameter in the iteration process. You need to download the webvtt file, make necessary edits, and then upload it to your Azure Blob storage. You need to specify the Blob URL.

To start translating your video or update an iteration for an existing translation, you need to construct an HTTP PUT request path and body according to the following instructions:

- Specify the required `webvttFile` input parameter. The `webvttFile` parameter is required starting from the second iteration. You need to [download the most recent webvtt file](#download-from-the-result-urls), make the desired edits, and then upload it to your Azure Blob storage. You need to specify the Blob URL. The subtitle file can be in WebVTT or JSON format. 
- Optionally, you can specify new settings for the new iteration, such as `speakerCount`, `subtitleMaxCharCountPerSegment`, and `exportSubtitleInVideo`.

For authentication and authorization, you need to include the following headers and path IDs in your request:
- Set the `Operation-Id` header: The `Operation-Id` must be unique for each operation, such as creating each iteration. Replace `Your-Operation-Id` with a unique ID for this operation.
- Replace `Your-Translation-Id` in the path. Use the same translation ID that you specified when you [created the translation](#step-1-create-a-translation). The translation ID remains unchanged.
- Specify a new `iterationId` in the path. The iteration ID must be unique for each operation. Replace `Your-Iteration-Id-2` with an iteration ID of your choice.
- Replace `YourSpeechResourceKey` with your Speech resource key and replace `YourSpeechResourceRegion` with your Speech resource region. 

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X PUT -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechResourceKey" \
-H "Operation-Id: Your-Operation-Id" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "input": {
    "webvttFile": {
      "url": "https://YourBlobStorageUrl/YourWebVTTFile.vtt"
    }
  }
}' "https://YourSpeechResourceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/videotranslation/translations/Your-Translation-Id/iterations/Your-Iteration-Id-2?api-version=2024-05-20-preview"
```

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "webvttFile": {
      "url": "https://YourBlobStorageUrl/YourWebVTTFile.vtt"
    }
  },
  "status": "NotStarted",
  "lastActionDateTime": "2025-03-06T19:15:38.722Z",
  "id": "Your-Iteration-Id-2",
  "createdDateTime": "2025-03-06T19:15:38.722Z"
}
```

You can use the operation ID that you specified and use the [Get operation by operation ID](#get-operation-by-operation-id) API periodically until the returned status is `Succeeded` or `Failed`. This operation allows you to monitor the progress of your creating the iteration process. The status property should progress from `NotStarted` to `Running`, and finally to `Succeeded` or `Failed`. 

## Get operation by operation ID

Check the status of an operation using its operation ID. The operation ID is unique for each operation, so you can track each operation separately. The operation ID is valid until the translation is deleted.

- Specify the same `Operation-Id` that you used when creating the translation. In the example, `Your-Operation-Id-1` is used. Replace `Your-Operation-Id-1` with an operation ID of your choice. 
- Replace `YourSpeechResourceKey` with your Speech resource key and replace `YourSpeechResourceRegion` with your Speech resource region.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X GET -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechResourceKey" "https://YourSpeechResourceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/videotranslation/operations/Your-Operation-Id-1?api-version=2024-05-20-preview" 
```

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "Your-Operation-Id-1",
  "status": "Running"
}
```

## Delete a translation by translation ID

Remove a specific translation identified by `translationId`. This operation also removes all iterations associated with this translation. 

Replace `YourSpeechResourceKey` with your Speech resource key,  `YourSpeechResourceRegion` with your Speech resource region, and `Your-Translation-Id` with the translation ID you want to delete. If not deleted manually, the service retains the translation history for up to 31 days.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X DELETE -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechResourceKey" "https://YourSpeechResourceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/videotranslation/translations/Your-Translation-Id?api-version=2024-05-20-preview" 
```

The response headers include `HTTP/1.1 204 No Content` if the delete request was successful.

## REST API operations

You can use the following REST API operations for video translation:

| Operation | Method | REST API call |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
