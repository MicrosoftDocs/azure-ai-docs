## Create a speech configuration instance

To call the Speech service by using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechconfig) instance. This class includes information about your subscription, like your key and associated region, endpoint, host, or authorization token.

1. Create an AI Services resource for Speech in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAIServices). Get the Speech resource key and region.
1. Create a `SpeechConfig` instance by using the following code. Replace `YourSpeechKey` and `YourSpeechRegion` with your Speech resource key and region.

```javascript
const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("YourSpeechKey", "YourSpeechRegion");
```

You can initialize `SpeechConfig` in a few other ways:

* Use an endpoint, and pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* Use a host, and pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* Use an authorization token with the associated region/location.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you always create a configuration.

## Recognize speech from a microphone

Recognizing speech from a microphone isn't supported in Node.js. It's supported only in a browser-based JavaScript environment. For more information, see the [React sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample) and the [implementation of speech to text from a microphone](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample/blob/main/src/App.js#L29) on GitHub. The React sample shows design patterns for the exchange and management of authentication tokens. It also shows the capture of audio from a microphone or file for speech to text conversions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use a *specific* audio input device, you need to specify the device ID in `AudioConfig`. To learn how to get the device ID, see [Select an audio input device with the Speech SDK](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md).

## Recognize speech from a file 

To recognize speech from an audio file, create an `AudioConfig` instance by using the `fromWavFileInput()` method, which accepts a `Buffer` object. Then initialize [`SpeechRecognizer`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer) by passing `audioConfig` and `speechConfig`.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const sdk = require("microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk");
const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("YourSpeechKey", "YourSpeechRegion");

function fromFile() {
    let audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput(fs.readFileSync("YourAudioFile.wav"));
    let speechRecognizer = new sdk.SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

    speechRecognizer.recognizeOnceAsync(result => {
        console.log(`RECOGNIZED: Text=${result.text}`);
        speechRecognizer.close();
    });
}
fromFile();
```

## Recognize speech from an in-memory stream

For many use cases, your audio data likely comes from Azure Blob Storage. Or it's already in memory as an [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) or a similar raw data structure. The following code:

* Creates a push stream by using `createPushStream()`.
* Reads a *.wav* file by using `fs.createReadStream` for demonstration purposes. If you already have audio data in the `ArrayBuffer`, you can skip directly to writing the content to the input stream.
* Creates an audio configuration by using the push stream.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const sdk = require("microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk");
const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("YourSpeechKey", "YourSpeechRegion");

function fromStream() {
    let pushStream = sdk.AudioInputStream.createPushStream();

    fs.createReadStream("YourAudioFile.wav").on('data', function(arrayBuffer) {
        pushStream.write(arrayBuffer.slice());
    }).on('end', function() {
        pushStream.close();
    });
 
    let audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromStreamInput(pushStream);
    let speechRecognizer = new sdk.SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
    speechRecognizer.recognizeOnceAsync(result => {
        console.log(`RECOGNIZED: Text=${result.text}`);
        speechRecognizer.close();
    });
}
fromStream();
```

Using a push stream as input assumes that the audio data is raw pulse-code modulation (PCM) data that skips any headers. The API still works in certain cases if the header isn't skipped. For the best results, consider implementing logic to read off the headers so that `fs` begins at the *start of the audio data*.

## Handle errors

The previous examples only get the recognized text from the `result.text` property. To handle errors and other responses, you need to write some code to handle the result. The following code evaluates the [`result.reason`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognitionresult#reason) property and:

* Prints the recognition result: `ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech`.
* If there's no recognition match, it informs the user: `ResultReason.NoMatch`.
* If an error is encountered, it prints the error message: `ResultReason.Canceled`.

```javascript
switch (result.reason) {
    case sdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
        console.log(`RECOGNIZED: Text=${result.text}`);
        break;
    case sdk.ResultReason.NoMatch:
        console.log("NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
        break;
    case sdk.ResultReason.Canceled:
        const cancellation = sdk.CancellationDetails.fromResult(result);
        console.log(`CANCELED: Reason=${cancellation.reason}`);

        if (cancellation.reason == sdk.CancellationReason.Error) {
            console.log(`CANCELED: ErrorCode=${cancellation.ErrorCode}`);
            console.log(`CANCELED: ErrorDetails=${cancellation.errorDetails}`);
            console.log("CANCELED: Did you set the speech resource key and region values?");
        }
        break;
    }
```

## Use continuous recognition

The previous examples use single-shot recognition, which recognizes a single utterance. The end of a single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15 seconds of audio is processed.

In contrast, you can use continuous recognition when you want to control when to stop recognizing. It requires you to subscribe to the `Recognizing`, `Recognized`, and `Canceled` events to get the recognition results. To stop recognition, you must call [`stopContinuousRecognitionAsync`]
(/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer#microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk-speechrecognizer-stopcontinuousrecognitionasync). Here's an example of how continuous recognition is performed on an audio input file.

Start by defining the input and initializing [`SpeechRecognizer`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer):

```javascript
const speechRecognizer = new sdk.SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
```

Next, subscribe to the events sent from [`SpeechRecognizer`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer):

* [`recognizing`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer#recognizing): Signal for events that contain intermediate recognition results.
* [`recognized`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer#recognized): Signal for events that contain final recognition results, which indicate a successful recognition attempt.
* [`sessionStopped`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer#sessionstopped): Signal for events that indicate the end of a recognition session (operation).
* [`canceled`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer#canceled): Signal for events that contain canceled recognition results. These results indicate a recognition attempt that was canceled as a result of a direct cancelation request. Alternatively, they indicate a transport or protocol failure.

```javascript
speechRecognizer.recognizing = (s, e) => {
    console.log(`RECOGNIZING: Text=${e.result.text}`);
};

speechRecognizer.recognized = (s, e) => {
    if (e.result.reason == sdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech) {
        console.log(`RECOGNIZED: Text=${e.result.text}`);
    }
    else if (e.result.reason == sdk.ResultReason.NoMatch) {
        console.log("NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
    }
};

speechRecognizer.canceled = (s, e) => {
    console.log(`CANCELED: Reason=${e.reason}`);

    if (e.reason == sdk.CancellationReason.Error) {
        console.log(`"CANCELED: ErrorCode=${e.errorCode}`);
        console.log(`"CANCELED: ErrorDetails=${e.errorDetails}`);
        console.log("CANCELED: Did you set the speech resource key and region values?");
    }

    speechRecognizer.stopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
};

speechRecognizer.sessionStopped = (s, e) => {
    console.log("\n    Session stopped event.");
    speechRecognizer.stopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
};
```

With everything set up, call [`startContinuousRecognitionAsync`]
(/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer#microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk-speechrecognizer-startkeywordrecognitionasync) to start recognizing:

```javascript
speechRecognizer.startContinuousRecognitionAsync();

// Make the following call at some point to stop recognition:
// speechRecognizer.stopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
```

## Change the source language

A common task for speech recognition is specifying the input (or source) language. The following example shows how to change the input language to Italian. In your code, find your [`SpeechConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechconfig) instance and add this line directly below it:

```javascript
speechConfig.speechRecognitionLanguage = "it-IT";
```

The [`speechRecognitionLanguage`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechconfig#microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk-speechconfig-speechrecognitionlanguage) property expects a language-locale format string. For a list of supported locales, see [Language and voice support for the Speech service](../../../language-support.md).

## Language identification

You can use language identification with speech to text recognition when you need to identify the language in an audio source and then transcribe it to text.

For a complete code sample, see [Language identification](../../../language-identification.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).

## Use a custom endpoint

With [custom speech](../../../custom-speech-overview.md), you can upload your own data, test and train a custom model, compare accuracy between models, and deploy a model to a custom endpoint. The following example shows how to set a custom endpoint.

```javascript
var speechConfig = SpeechSDK.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");
speechConfig.endpointId = "YourEndpointId";
var speechRecognizer = new SpeechSDK.SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig);
```

## Run and use a container

Speech containers provide websocket-based query endpoint APIs that are accessed through the Speech SDK and Speech CLI. By default, the Speech SDK and Speech CLI use the public Speech service. To use the container, you need to change the initialization method. Use a container host URL instead of key and region.

For more information about containers, see Host URLs in [Install and run Speech containers with Docker](../../../speech-container-howto.md#host-urls).
