## Install Speech SDK and samples

The [Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk) repository contains samples written in Objective-C for iOS and Mac. Select a link to see installation instructions for each sample:

* [Recognize speech from a microphone in Objective-C on macOS](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/objectivec/macos/from-microphone)
* [Recognize speech in Objective-C on iOS](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/objectivec/ios/from-microphone)
* [More samples for Objective-C on iOS](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/objective-c/ios)

For more information, see the [Speech SDK for Objective-C reference](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/).

## Use a custom endpoint

With [custom speech](../../../custom-speech-overview.md), you can upload your own data, test and train a custom model, compare accuracy between models, and deploy a model to a custom endpoint. The following example shows how to set a custom endpoint:

```Objective-C
SPXSpeechConfiguration *speechConfig = [[SPXSpeechConfiguration alloc] initWithSubscription:"YourSpeechResoureKey" region:"YourServiceRegion"];
speechConfig.endpointId = "YourEndpointId";
SPXSpeechRecognizer* speechRecognizer = [[SPXSpeechRecognizer alloc] init:speechConfig];
```

## Run and use a container

Speech containers provide websocket-based query endpoint APIs that are accessed through the Speech SDK and Speech CLI. By default, the Speech SDK and Speech CLI use the public Speech service. To use the container, you need to change the initialization method. Use a container host URL instead of key and region.

For more information about containers, see Host URLs in [Install and run Speech containers with Docker](../../../speech-container-howto.md#host-urls).
