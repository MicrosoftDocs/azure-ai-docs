### Example offset and duration

The following table shows potential offset and duration in ticks when a speaker says "Welcome to Applied Mathematics course 201." In this example, the offset doesn't change throughout the `Recognizing` and `Recognized` events. However, don't rely on the offset to remain the same between the `Recognizing` and `Recognized` events, since the final result could be different.

|Event  |Text  |Offset (in ticks)  |Duration (in ticks) |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|RECOGNIZING     |welcome         |17000000         |5000000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |welcome to         |17000000         |6400000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |welcome to applied math          |17000000         |13600000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |welcome to applied mathematics         |17000000         |17200000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |welcome to applied mathematics course         |17000000         |23700000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |welcome to applied mathematics course 2         |17000000         |26700000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |welcome to applied mathematics course 201         |17000000         |33400000         |
|RECOGNIZED     |Welcome to applied Mathematics course 201.         |17000000         |34500000         |

The total duration of the first utterance was 3.45 seconds. It was recognized at 1.7 to 5.15 seconds offset from the start of the audio stream being recognized (00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.150).

If the speaker continues then to say "Let's get started," a new offset is calculated from the start of the audio stream being recognized, to the start of the new utterance. The following table shows potential offset and duration for an utterance that started two seconds after the previous utterance ended.

|Event  |Text  |Offset (in ticks)  |Duration (in ticks) |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|RECOGNIZING     |OK         |71500000         |3100000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |OK now         |71500000         |10300000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |OK now let's         |71500000         |14700000         |
|RECOGNIZING     |OK now let's get started         |71500000         |18500000         |
|RECOGNIZED     |OK, now let's get started.         |71500000         |20600000         |

The total duration of the second utterance was 2.06 seconds. It was recognized at 7.15 to 9.21 seconds offset from the start of the audio stream being recognized (00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.210).
