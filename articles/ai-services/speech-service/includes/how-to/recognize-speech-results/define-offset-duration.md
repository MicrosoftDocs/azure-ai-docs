- **Offset**: The offset into the audio stream being recognized, expressed as duration. Offset is measured in ticks, starting from `0` (zero) tick, associated with the first audio byte processed by the SDK. For example, the offset begins when you start recognition, since that's when the SDK starts processing the audio stream. One tick represents one hundred nanoseconds or one ten-millionth of a second. 
- **Duration**: Duration of the utterance that is being recognized. The duration in ticks doesn't include trailing or leading silence.
