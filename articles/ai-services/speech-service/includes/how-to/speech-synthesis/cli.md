## Synthesize speech to a speaker

Now you're ready to run the Speech CLI to synthesize speech from text.

- In a console window, change to the directory that contains the Speech CLI binary file. Then run the following command:

  ```console
  spx synthesize --text "I'm excited to try text to speech"
  ```

The Speech CLI produces natural language in English through the computer speaker.

## Synthesize speech to a file

- Run the following command to change the output from your speaker to a *.wav* file:

  ```console
  spx synthesize --text "I'm excited to try text to speech" --audio output greetings.wav
  ```

The Speech CLI produces natural language in English to the *greetings.wav* audio file.

## Run and use a container

Speech containers provide websocket-based query endpoint APIs that are accessed through the Speech SDK and Speech CLI. By default, the Speech SDK and Speech CLI use the public Speech service. To use the container, you need to change the initialization method. Use a container host URL instead of key and region.

For more information about containers, see [Install and run Speech containers with Docker](../../../speech-container-howto.md).
