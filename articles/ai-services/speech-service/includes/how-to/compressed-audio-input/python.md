## GStreamer configuration

The Speech SDK can use [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) to handle compressed audio. For licensing reasons, GStreamer binaries aren't compiled and linked with the Speech SDK. You need to install some dependencies and plug-ins.  

GStreamer binaries must be in the system path so that they can be loaded by the Speech SDK at runtime. For example, on Windows, if the Speech SDK finds `libgstreamer-1.0-0.dll` or `gstreamer-1.0-0.dll` (for the latest GStreamer) during runtime, it means the GStreamer binaries are in the system path.

Choose a platform for installation instructions.

## Example

To configure the Speech SDK to accept compressed audio input, create `PullAudioInputStream` or `PushAudioInputStream`. Then, create an `AudioConfig` from an instance of your stream class that specifies the compression format of the stream.

Let's assume that your use case is to use `PullStream` for an `MP3` file. Your code might look like this:

```python

import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

class BinaryFileReaderCallback(speechsdk.audio.PullAudioInputStreamCallback):
    def __init__(self, filename: str):
        super().__init__()
        self._file_h = open(filename, "rb")

    def read(self, buffer: memoryview) -> int:
        print('trying to read {} frames'.format(buffer.nbytes))
        try:
            size = buffer.nbytes
            frames = self._file_h.read(size)

            buffer[:len(frames)] = frames
            print('read {} frames'.format(len(frames)))

            return len(frames)
        except Exception as ex:
            print('Exception in `read`: {}'.format(ex))
            raise

    def close(self) -> None:
        print('closing file')
        try:
            self._file_h.close()
        except Exception as ex:
            print('Exception in `close`: {}'.format(ex))
            raise

def compressed_stream_helper(compressed_format,
        mp3_file_path,
        default_speech_auth):
    callback = BinaryFileReaderCallback(mp3_file_path)
    stream = speechsdk.audio.PullAudioInputStream(stream_format=compressed_format, pull_stream_callback=callback)

    speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(**default_speech_auth)
    audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioConfig(stream=stream)

    speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_config)

    done = False

    def stop_cb(evt):
        """callback that signals to stop continuous recognition upon receiving an event `evt`"""
        print('CLOSING on {}'.format(evt))
        nonlocal done
        done = True

    # Connect callbacks to the events fired by the speech recognizer
    speech_recognizer.recognizing.connect(lambda evt: print('RECOGNIZING: {}'.format(evt)))
    speech_recognizer.recognized.connect(lambda evt: print('RECOGNIZED: {}'.format(evt)))
    speech_recognizer.session_started.connect(lambda evt: print('SESSION STARTED: {}'.format(evt)))
    speech_recognizer.session_stopped.connect(lambda evt: print('SESSION STOPPED {}'.format(evt)))
    speech_recognizer.canceled.connect(lambda evt: print('CANCELED {}'.format(evt)))
    # stop continuous recognition on either session stopped or canceled events
    speech_recognizer.session_stopped.connect(stop_cb)
    speech_recognizer.canceled.connect(stop_cb)

    # Start continuous speech recognition
    speech_recognizer.start_continuous_recognition()
    while not done:
        time.sleep(.5)

    speech_recognizer.stop_continuous_recognition()

def pull_audio_input_stream_compressed_mp3(mp3_file_path: str,
        default_speech_auth):
    # Create a compressed format
    compressed_format = speechsdk.audio.AudioStreamFormat(compressed_stream_format=speechsdk.AudioStreamContainerFormat.MP3)
    compressed_stream_helper(compressed_format, mp3_file_path, default_speech_auth)

```
