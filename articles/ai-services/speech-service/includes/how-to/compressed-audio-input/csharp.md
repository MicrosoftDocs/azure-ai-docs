## GStreamer configuration

The Speech SDK can use [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) to handle compressed audio. For licensing reasons, GStreamer binaries aren't compiled and linked with the Speech SDK. You need to install some dependencies and plug-ins.  

GStreamer binaries must be in the system path so that they can be loaded by the Speech SDK at runtime. For example, on Windows, if the Speech SDK finds `libgstreamer-1.0-0.dll` or `gstreamer-1.0-0.dll` (for the latest GStreamer) during runtime, it means the GStreamer binaries are in the system path.

Choose a platform for installation instructions.

## Example

To configure the Speech SDK to accept compressed audio input, create `PullAudioInputStream` or `PushAudioInputStream`. Then, create an `AudioConfig` from an instance of your stream class that specifies the compression format of the stream. Find related sample code snippets in [About the Speech SDK audio input stream API](../../../how-to-use-audio-input-streams.md).

Let's assume that you have an input stream class called `pullStream` and are using OPUS/OGG. Your code might look like this:

```csharp
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

// ... omitted for brevity

var speechConfig =
    SpeechConfig.FromSubscription(
        "YourSpeechResoureKey",
        "YourServiceRegion");

// Create an audio config specifying the compressed
// audio format and the instance of your input stream class.
var pullStream = AudioInputStream.CreatePullStream(
    AudioStreamFormat.GetCompressedFormat(AudioStreamContainerFormat.OGG_OPUS));
var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromStreamInput(pullStream);

using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();

var text = result.Text;
```
