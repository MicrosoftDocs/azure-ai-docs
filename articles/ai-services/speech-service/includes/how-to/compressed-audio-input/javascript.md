[!INCLUDE [Header](../../common/javascript.md)]

The Speech SDK for JavaScript does not support compressed audio.

The default audio streaming format is WAV (16 kHz or 8 kHz, 16-bit, and mono PCM). To input a compressed audio file (such as mp3), you must first convert it to a WAV file in the default input format. To stream compressed audio, you must first decode the audio buffers to the default input format. For more information, see [How to use the audio input stream](../../../how-to-use-audio-input-streams.md).
