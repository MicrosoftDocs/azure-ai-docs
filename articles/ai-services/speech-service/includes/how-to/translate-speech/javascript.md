## Create a translation configuration

To call the translation service by using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechtranslationconfig) instance. This class includes information about your Speech resource, like your key and associated region, endpoint, host, or authorization token.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you'll always create a configuration.

You can initialize `SpeechTranslationConfig` in a few ways:

* With a subscription: pass in a key and the associated region.
* With an endpoint: pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With a host: pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With an authorization token: pass in an authorization token and the associated region.

Let's look at how you create a `SpeechTranslationConfig` instance by using a key and region. Get the Speech resource key and region in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

```javascript
const speechTranslationConfig = SpeechTranslationConfig.fromSubscription("YourSpeechResoureKey", "YourServiceRegion");
```

## Initialize a translator

After you created a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechtranslationconfig) instance, the next step is to initialize [`TranslationRecognizer`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer). When you initialize `TranslationRecognizer`, you need to pass it your `speechTranslationConfig` instance. The configuration object provides the credentials that the translation service requires to validate your request.

If you're translating speech provided through your device's default microphone, here's what `TranslationRecognizer` should look like:

```javascript
const translationRecognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(speechTranslationConfig);
```

If you want to specify the audio input device, then you need to create an [`AudioConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/audioconfig) class instance and provide the `audioConfig` parameter when initializing `TranslationRecognizer`.

> [!TIP]
> [Learn how to get the device ID for your audio input device](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md).

Reference the `AudioConfig` object as follows:

```javascript
const audioConfig = AudioConfig.fromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
const translationRecognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(speechTranslationConfig, audioConfig);
```

If you want to provide an audio file instead of using a microphone, you still need to provide an `audioConfig` parameter. However, you can do this only when you're targeting Node.js. When you create an `AudioConfig` class instance, instead of calling `fromDefaultMicrophoneInput`, you call `fromWavFileOutput` and pass the `filename` parameter:

```javascript
const audioConfig = AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
const translationRecognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(speechTranslationConfig, audioConfig);
```

## Translate speech

The [TranslationRecognizer class](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer) for the Speech SDK for JavaScript exposes methods that you can use for speech translation:

* *Single-shot translation (async)*: Performs translation in a nonblocking (asynchronous) mode. It translates a single utterance. It determines the end of a single utterance by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15 seconds of audio is processed.
* *Continuous translation (async)*: Asynchronously initiates a continuous translation operation. The user registers to events and handles various application states. To stop asynchronous continuous translation, call [`stopContinuousRecognitionAsync`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer#stopcontinuousrecognitionasync).

To learn more about how to choose a speech recognition mode, see [Get started with speech to text](../../../get-started-speech-to-text.md).

### Specify a target language

To translate, you must specify both a source language and at least one target language.

You can choose a source language by using a locale listed in the [Speech translation table](../../../language-support.md). Find your options for translated language at the same link. 

Your options for target languages differ when you want to view text or
you want to hear synthesized translated speech. To translate from English to German, modify the translation configuration object:

```javascript
speechTranslationConfig.speechRecognitionLanguage = "en-US";
speechTranslationConfig.addTargetLanguage("de");
```

### Single-shot recognition

Here's an example of asynchronous single-shot translation via [`recognizeOnceAsync`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer#recognizeonceasync):

```javascript
translationRecognizer.recognizeOnceAsync(result => {
    // Interact with result
});
```

You need to write some code to handle the result. This sample evaluates [`result.reason`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognitionresult) for a translation to German:

```javascript
translationRecognizer.recognizeOnceAsync(
  function (result) {
    let translation = result.translations.get("de");
    window.console.log(translation);
    translationRecognizer.close();
  },
  function (err) {
    window.console.log(err);
    translationRecognizer.close();
});
```

Your code can also handle updates provided while the translation is processing. You can use these updates to provide visual feedback about the translation progress. [This JavaScript
Node.js example](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/samples/js/node/translation.js) shows these kinds of updates. The following code also displays details produced during the translation process:

```javascript
translationRecognizer.recognizing = function (s, e) {
    var str = ("(recognizing) Reason: " + SpeechSDK.ResultReason[e.result.reason] +
            " Text: " +  e.result.text +
            " Translation:");
    str += e.result.translations.get("de");
    console.log(str);
};
translationRecognizer.recognized = function (s, e) {
    var str = "\r\n(recognized)  Reason: " + SpeechSDK.ResultReason[e.result.reason] +
            " Text: " + e.result.text +
            " Translation:";
    str += e.result.translations.get("de");
    str += "\r\n";
    console.log(str);
};
```

### Continuous translation

Continuous translation is a bit more involved than single-shot recognition. It requires you to subscribe to the `recognizing`, `recognized`, and `canceled` events to get the recognition results. To stop translation, you must call [`stopContinuousRecognitionAsync`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer#stopcontinuousrecognitionasync). 

Here's an example of how continuous translation is performed on an audio input file. Let's start by defining the input and initializing [`TranslationRecognizer`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer):

```javascript
const translationRecognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(speechTranslationConfig);
```

In the following code, you subscribe to the events sent from `TranslationRecognizer`:

* [`recognizing`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer#recognizing): Signal for events that contain intermediate translation results.
* [`recognized`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer#recognized): Signal for events that contain final translation results. These results indicate a successful translation attempt.
* [`sessionStopped`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer#sessionstopped): Signal for events that indicate the end of a translation session (operation).
* [`canceled`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/translationrecognizer#canceled): Signal for events that contain canceled translation results. These events indicate a translation attempt that was canceled as a result of a direct cancellation. Alternatively, they indicate a transport or protocol failure.

```javascript
translationRecognizer.recognizing = (s, e) => {
    console.log(`TRANSLATING: Text=${e.result.text}`);
};
translationRecognizer.recognized = (s, e) => {
    if (e.result.reason == ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech) {
        console.log(`TRANSLATED: Text=${e.result.text}`);
    }
    else if (e.result.reason == ResultReason.NoMatch) {
        console.log("NOMATCH: Speech could not be translated.");
    }
};
translationRecognizer.canceled = (s, e) => {
    console.log(`CANCELED: Reason=${e.reason}`);
    if (e.reason == CancellationReason.Error) {
        console.log(`"CANCELED: ErrorCode=${e.errorCode}`);
        console.log(`"CANCELED: ErrorDetails=${e.errorDetails}`);
        console.log("CANCELED: Did you set the speech resource key and region values?");
    }
    translationRecognizer.stopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
};
translationRecognizer.sessionStopped = (s, e) => {
    console.log("\n    Session stopped event.");
    translationRecognizer.stopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
};
```

With everything set up, you can call [`startContinuousRecognitionAsync`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechrecognizer#startcontinuousrecognitionasync):

```javascript
// Starts continuous recognition. Uses stopContinuousRecognitionAsync() to stop recognition.
translationRecognizer.startContinuousRecognitionAsync();
// Something later can call. Stops recognition.
// translationRecognizer.StopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
```

## Choose a source language

A common task for speech translation is specifying the input (or source) language. The following example shows how you would change the input language to Italian. In your code, find your [`SpeechTranslationConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechtranslationconfig) instance and add the following line directly below it:

```javascript
speechTranslationConfig.speechRecognitionLanguage = "it-IT";
```

The [`speechRecognitionLanguage`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechtranslationconfig#speechrecognitionlanguage) property expects a language-locale format string. Refer to the [list of supported speech translation locales](../../../language-support.md?tabs=speech-translation).

## Choose one or more target languages

The Speech SDK can translate to multiple target languages in parallel. 
The available target languages are somewhat different from the source language list. You specify target languages by using a language code, rather than a locale.

For a list of language codes for text targets, see 
[the speech translation table on the language support page](../../../language-support.md?tabs=speech-translation). You can also find details about translation to synthesized languages there.

The following code adds German as a target language:

```javascript
speechTranslationConfig.addTargetLanguage("de");
```

Because multiple target language translations are possible, your code must specify the target language when examining the result. The following code gets translation results for German:

```javascript
translationRecognizer.recognized = function (s, e) {
    var str = "\r\n(recognized)  Reason: " +
            sdk.ResultReason[e.result.reason] +
            " Text: " + e.result.text + " Translations:";
    var language = "de";
    str += " [" + language + "] " + e.result.translations.get(language);
    str += "\r\n";
    // show str somewhere
};
```
