Content for [custom voice](https://aka.ms/customvoice) like data, models, tests, and endpoints are organized into projects in Speech Studio. Each project is specific to a country/region and language, and the gender of the voice you want to create. For example, you might create a project for a female voice for your call center's chat bots that use English in the United States.

All it takes to get started are a handful of audio files and the associated transcriptions. See if custom voice supports your [language](../../../../language-support.md?tabs=tts) and [region](../../../../regions.md#regions).

## Start fine-tuning

To fine-tune a professional voice model, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Speech Studio](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/customvoice).
1. Select the subscription and Speech resource to work with. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Custom voice training is currently only available in some regions. After your voice model is trained in a supported region, you can copy it to a Speech resource in another region as needed. See footnotes in the [regions](../../../../regions.md#regions) table for more information.

1. Select **Custom voice** > **Create a project**. 
1. Select **Custom neural voice Pro** > **Next**. 
1. Follow the instructions provided by the wizard to create your project. 

Select the new project by name or select **Go to project**. You see these menu items in the left panel: **Set up voice talent**, **Prepare training data**, **Train model**, and **Deploy model**.
