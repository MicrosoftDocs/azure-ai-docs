# Asynchronous conversation transcription multichannel diarization

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in public preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

In this article, asynchronous conversation transcription multichannel diarization is demonstrated using the **RemoteMeetingTranscriptionClient** API. If you configured conversation transcription to do asynchronous transcription and have a `meetingId`, you can obtain the transcription associated with that `meetingId` using the **RemoteMeetingTranscriptionClient** API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Conversation transcription multichannel diarization (preview) is retiring on March 28, 2025. For more information about migrating to other speech to text features, see [Migrate away from conversation transcription multichannel diarization](meeting-transcription.md#migrate-away-from-conversation-transcription-multichannel-diarization).

## Asynchronous vs. real-time + asynchronous

With asynchronous transcription, you stream the meeting audio, but don't need a transcription returned in real-time. Instead, after the audio is sent, use the `meetingId` of `Meeting` to query for the status of the asynchronous transcription. When the asynchronous transcription is ready, you get a `RemoteMeetingTranscriptionResult`.

With real-time plus asynchronous, you get the transcription in real-time, but also get the transcription by querying with the `meetingId` (similar to asynchronous scenario).

Two steps are required to accomplish asynchronous transcription. The first step is to upload the audio, choosing either asynchronous only or real-time plus asynchronous. The second step is to get the transcription results.
