# What is sentiment analysis and opinion mining?

Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are features offered by [the Language service](../overview.md), a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for developing intelligent applications that involve written language. These features help you discover what people think about your brand or topic by analyzing text for signs of positive or negative sentiment. They can also link these sentiments to specific aspects of the text.

Both sentiment analysis and opinion mining work with various [written languages](./language-support.md).

## Sentiment analysis

The sentiment analysis feature assigns sentiment labels, such as "negative," "neutral," and "positive." The service determines these labels using the highest confidence score. Sentiment is evaluated at both the sentence level and the document level. This feature also returns confidence scores between 0 and 1 for each document & sentences within it for positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.

## Opinion mining

Opinion mining is a feature of sentiment analysis, also known as aspect-based sentiment analysis in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This feature provides more granular information about the opinions related to words (such as the attributes of products or services) in text.

An AI system encompasses more than just the technology itself. An AI system includes the individuals who operate the system, the people who experience its effects, and the broader environment where the system functions all play a role.
