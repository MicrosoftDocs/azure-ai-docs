# Send a Custom sentiment analysis request to your custom model

After the deployment is added successfully, you can query the deployment to extract entities from your text based on the model you assigned to the deployment.
You can query the deployment programmatically using the [Prediction API](/rest/api/language/text-analysis-runtime/analyze-text) or through the client libraries (Azure SDK). 

## Test a deployed Custom sentiment analysis model

You can use Language Studio to submit the custom entity recognition task and visualize the results. 

[!INCLUDE [Test model](../../../includes/custom/language-studio/test-model.md)]
