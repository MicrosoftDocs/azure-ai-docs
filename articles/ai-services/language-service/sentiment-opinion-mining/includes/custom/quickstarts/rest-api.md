## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).



## Create a new Azure Language resource and Azure storage account

Before you can use Custom sentiment analysis, you'll need to create an Azure Language resource, which will give you the credentials that you need to create a project and start training a model. You'll also need an Azure storage account, where you can upload your dataset that will be used in building your model.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To get started quickly, we recommend creating a new Azure Language resource using the steps provided in this article, which will let you create the Language resource, and create and/or connect a storage account at the same time, which is easier than doing it later.

<!-- If you have a [pre-existing resource](../../../custom/how-to/create-project.md#using-a-pre-existing-language-resource) that you'd like to use, you will need to connect it to storage account.-->

[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from the Azure portal](../../../../includes/custom/resource-creation-azure-portal.md)]
    
## Upload sample data to blob container

After you have created an Azure storage account and connected it to your Language resource, you will need to upload the documents from the sample dataset to the root directory of your container. These documents will later be used to train your model.

Start by [downloading the sample dataset for Custom sentiment analysis projects](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/language-service/Custom%20sentiment%20analysis/example_data.zip). Open the .zip file, and extract the folder containing the documents. The provided sample dataset contains documents, each of which is a short example of a customer review.

[!INCLUDE [Uploading sample data for Custom sentiment analysis](../../../../includes/custom/language-studio/upload-data-to-storage.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Get keys and endpoint Azure Portal](../../../../includes/get-key-endpoint.md)]

## Create a Custom sentiment analysis project

Once your resource and storage container are configured, create a new Custom sentiment analysis project. A project is a work area for building your custom ML models based on your data. Your project can only be accessed by you and others who have access to the Language resource being used.

### Trigger import project job 

[!INCLUDE [Import a project using the REST API](../rest-api/import-project.md)]



### Get import job status

[!INCLUDE [get import project status](../rest-api/get-import-status.md)]



## Train your model

Typically after you create a project, you start tagging the documents you have in the container connected to your project. For this quickstart, you have imported a sample tagged dataset and initialized your project with the sample JSON tags file.

### Start training your model

After your project has been imported, you can start training your model. 

[!INCLUDE [train model](../rest-api/train-model.md)]



### Get training job status

Training could take sometime between 10 and 30 minutes. You can use the following request to keep polling the status of the training job until it's successfully completed.

[!INCLUDE [get training model status](../rest-api/get-training-status.md)]



## Deploy your model

Generally after training a model you would review its evaluation details and make improvements if necessary. In this quickstart, you will just deploy your model, and make it available for you to try in Language Studio, or you can call the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger).

### Submit deployment job

[!INCLUDE [deploy model](../rest-api/deploy-model.md)]



### Get deployment job status

[!INCLUDE [get deployment status](../rest-api/get-deployment-status.md)]



## Classify text

After your model is deployed successfully, you can start using it to classify your text via [Prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger). In the sample dataset you downloaded earlier you can find some test documents that you can use in this step.

### Submit a Custom sentiment analysis task

[!INCLUDE [submit a text classification task using the REST API](../rest-api/submit-task.md)]



### Get task results

[!INCLUDE [get text classification task results](../rest-api/get-results.md)]




## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [Delete project using the REST API](../rest-api/delete-project.md)]
