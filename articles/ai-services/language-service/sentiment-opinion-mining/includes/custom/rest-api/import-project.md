Once you send your API request, you’ll receive a `202` response indicating that the job was submitted correctly. In the response headers, extract the `operation-location` value. It will be formatted like this: 

```rest
{ENDPOINT}/language/authoring/analyze-text/projects/{PROJECT-NAME}/import/jobs/{JOB-ID}?api-version={API-VERSION}
``` 

`{JOB-ID}` is used to identify your request, since this operation is asynchronous. You’ll use this URL to get the import job status.  

Possible error scenarios for this request:

<!--* The selected resource doesn't have [proper permissions](../../../custom/how-to/create-project.md#using-a-pre-existing-language-resource) for the storage account.-->
* The `storageInputContainerName` specified doesn't exist.
* Invalid language code is used, or if the language code type isn't string.
* `multilingual` value is a string and not a boolean.
