## Use Sentiment Analysis in the Azure AI Foundry Playground

The **Language Playground** consists of four sections:

* Top banner: You can select any of the currently available Language services here.
* Right pane: This pane is where you can find the **Configuration** options for the service, such as the API and model version, along with features specific to the service.

* Right pane: This pane is where **Details** of the run operation are shown.

Here you can select the Sentiment Analysis capability by choosing the top banner tile, **Analyze sentiment**.

## Use Analyze sentiment

**Analyze sentiment** is designed to identify positive, negative and neutral sentiment in text.

In **Configuration** there are the following options:

|Option              |Description                              |

|Select model version| Select which version of the model to use.|
|Select text language| Select the language of the input text. |
|Enable opinion mining| Enables or disables the opinion mining skill.|

After your operation is completed, in the center pane, each sentence will be numbered and opinions will be labeled if **Enable opinion mining** was checked and the **Details** section contains the following fields for the overall sentiment and the sentiment of each sentence:

|Field | Description                |

|Sentence number|The number of the sentence in the order it was typed. This field is not present for **Overall sentiment**.|
|Sentiment| The detected overall sentiment for the segment of text.|
|Scores| The amount of positive, neutral and negative sentiment detected in the text segment.|

The following fields are only present if opinion mining is enabled:

|Field | Description                |

|Assessments| The detected opinion and the detected persuasion (positive, neutral, negative), as well as the percent of detected persuasion.|
