# What is Text Analytics for health?

[!INCLUDE [service notice](includes/service-notice.md)]

Text Analytics for health is one of the prebuilt features offered by [Azure AI Language](../overview.md). Text Analytics for health uses machine learning to identify and label medical information in unstructured text such as doctor's notes, clinical documents, and electronic health records. It extracts key data from sources like discharge summaries to support healthcare analysis.

> [!TIP]
> Try out Text Analytics for health [in Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/explore/language). There you can [utilize a currently existing Language Studio resource or create a new Azure AI Foundry resource](../../../ai-services/connect-services-ai-foundry-portal.md) in order to use this service.

This documentation contains the following types of articles:
* The [**quickstart article**](quickstart.md) provides a short tutorial that guides you with making your first request to the service.
* The [**how-to guides**](how-to/call-api.md) contain detailed instructions on how to make calls to the service using the hosted API or using the on-premises Docker container.
* The [**conceptual articles**](concepts/health-entity-categories.md) provide in-depth information on each of the service's features, named entity recognition, relation extraction, entity linking, and assertion detection.

## Text Analytics for health features

Text Analytics for health performs four key functions, all with a single API call:

* Named entity recognition
* Relation extraction
* Entity linking
* Assertion detection

[!INCLUDE [Text Analytics for health](includes/features.md)]

Text Analytics for health can receive unstructured text in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hebrew.

Additionally, Text Analytics for health can return the processed output using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) structure that enables the service's integration with other electronic health systems.

## Usage scenarios

Text Analytics for health can be used in multiple scenarios across various industries.
Some common customer motivations for using Text Analytics for health include:
* Assisting and automating the processing of medical documents by proper medical coding to ensure accurate care and billing.
* Increasing the efficiency of analyzing healthcare data to help drive the success of value-based care models similar to Medicare.
* Minimizing healthcare provider effort by automating the aggregation of key patient data for trend and pattern monitoring.
* Facilitating and supporting the adoption of HL7 standards across the healthcare industry. By doing so, we help improve the exchange, integration, sharing, retrieval, and delivery of electronic health information in all areas of healthcare services.
