Spanish – “es”
French  - “fr”
German – “de”
Italian – “it”
Portuguese – “pt”
```
```json
json

{
    "analysisInput": {
        "documents": [
            {
                "text": "El médico prescrió 200 mg de ibuprofeno.",
                "language": "es",
                "id": "1"
            }
        ]
    },
