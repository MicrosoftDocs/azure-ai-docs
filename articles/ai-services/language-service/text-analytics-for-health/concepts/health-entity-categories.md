# Supported Text Analytics for health entity categories

Text Analytics for health processes and extracts insights from unstructured medical data. The service detects and surfaces medical concepts, assigns assertions to concepts, infers semantic relations between concepts and links them to common medical ontologies.

Text Analytics for health detects medical concepts that fall under the following categories.

## Anatomy

### Entities

**BODY_STRUCTURE** - Body systems, anatomic locations or regions, and body sites. For example, arm, knee, abdomen, nose, liver, head, respiratory system, lymphocytes.
