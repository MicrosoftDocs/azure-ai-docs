# How to use Text Analytics for health

[!INCLUDE [service notice](../includes/service-notice.md)]

Text Analytics for health can be used to extract and label relevant medical information from unstructured texts such as doctors' notes, discharge summaries, clinical documents, and electronic health records. The service performs [named entity recognition](../concepts/health-entity-categories.md), [relation extraction](../concepts/relation-extraction.md), [entity linking](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html), and [assertion detection](../concepts/assertion-detection.md) to uncover insights from the input text. For information  on the returned confidence scores, see the [transparency note](/legal/cognitive-services/text-analytics/transparency-note#general-guidelines-to-understand-and-improve-performance?context=/azure/ai-services/text-analytics/context/context).

> [!TIP]
> If you want to test out the feature without writing any code, use the [Language Studio](../../language-studio.md).

There are two ways to call the service: 

* A [Docker container](use-containers.md) (synchronous)
* Using the web-based API and client libraries (asynchronous) 

## Development options

[!INCLUDE [Development options](../includes/development-options.md)]

### Input languages

The Text Analytics for health supports English in addition to multiple languages that are currently in preview. You can use the hosted API or deploy the API in a container, as detailed [under Text Analytics for health languages support](../language-support.md).

## Submitting data

To send an API request, you will need your Language resource endpoint and key.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the key and endpoint for your Language resource on the Azure portal. They will be located on the resource's **Key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 

Analysis is performed upon receipt of the request. If you send a request using the REST API or client library, the results will be returned asynchronously. If you're using the Docker container, they will be returned synchronously.  

[!INCLUDE [asynchronous-result-availability](../../includes/async-result-availability.md)]


## Submitting a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) request

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the health industry communication standard developed by the Health Level Seven International (HL7) organization.  The standard defines the data formats (resources) and API structure for exchanging electronic healthcare data. To receive your result using the **FHIR** structure, you must send the FHIR version in the API request body. 

| Parameter Name  | Type |  Value |
