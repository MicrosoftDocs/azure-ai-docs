[Reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/azure/ai-language-text-readme) | [More samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/cognitivelanguage/ai-language-text/samples/v1) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-language-text) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/cognitivelanguage/ai-language-text) 

Use this quickstart to create a Text Analytics for health application with the client library for Node.js. In the following example, you create a JavaScript application that can identify medical [entities](../../concepts/health-entity-categories.md), [relations](../../concepts/relation-extraction.md), and [assertions](../../concepts/assertion-detection.md) that appear in text.


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14 LTS or later
* Once you have your Azure subscription, [create an AI services resource](../../../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#create-a-new-azure-ai-services-resource).
    * You need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You paste your key and endpoint into the code later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service (providing 5,000 text records - 1,000 characters each) and upgrade later to the `Standard S` pricing tier for production. You can also start with the `Standard S` pricing tier, receiving the same initial quota for free (5,000 text records) before getting charged. For more information on pricing, visit [Language Service Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service/).



## Setting up

[!INCLUDE [Create environment variables](../../../includes/environment-variables.md)]



### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp 

cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

### Install the client library

Install the npm package:

```console
npm install @azure/ai-language-text
```



## Code example

Open the file and copy the below code. Then run the code.  

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
"use strict";

const { TextAnalyticsClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-text-analytics");
// This example requires environment variables named "LANGUAGE_KEY" and "LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT"
const key = process.env.LANGUAGE_KEY;
const endpoint = process.env.LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT;

const documents = ["Patient does not suffer from high blood pressure."];
  
  async function main() {
    console.log("== Text analytics for health sample ==");
  
    const client = new TextAnalysisClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(key));
    const actions = [
      {
        kind: "Healthcare",
      },
    ];
    const poller = await client.beginAnalyzeBatch(actions, documents, "en");
  
    poller.onProgress(() => {
      console.log(
        `Last time the operation was updated was on: ${poller.getOperationState().modifiedOn}`
      );
    });
    console.log(`The operation was created on ${poller.getOperationState().createdOn}`);
    console.log(`The operation results will expire on ${poller.getOperationState().expiresOn}`);
  
    const results = await poller.pollUntilDone();
  
    for await (const actionResult of results) {
      if (actionResult.kind !== "Healthcare") {
        throw new Error(`Expected a healthcare results but got: ${actionResult.kind}`);
      }
      if (actionResult.error) {
        const { code, message } = actionResult.error;
        throw new Error(`Unexpected error (${code}): ${message}`);
      }
      for (const result of actionResult.results) {
        console.log(`- Document ${result.id}`);
        if (result.error) {
          const { code, message } = result.error;
          throw new Error(`Unexpected error (${code}): ${message}`);
        }
        console.log("\tRecognized Entities:");
        for (const entity of result.entities) {
          console.log(`\t- Entity "${entity.text}" of type ${entity.category}`);
          if (entity.dataSources.length > 0) {
            console.log("\t and it can be referenced in the following data sources:");
            for (const ds of entity.dataSources) {
              console.log(`\t\t- ${ds.name} with Entity ID: ${ds.entityId}`);
            }
          }
        }
        if (result.entityRelations.length > 0) {
          console.log(`\tRecognized relations between entities:`);
          for (const relation of result.entityRelations) {
            console.log(
              `\t\t- Relation of type ${relation.relationType} found between the following entities:`
            );
            for (const role of relation.roles) {
              console.log(`\t\t\t- "${role.entity.text}" with the role ${role.name}`);
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  main().catch((err) => {
    console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
  });
```

### Output

```console
== Text analytics for health sample ==
The operation was created on Mon Feb 13 2023 13:12:10 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
