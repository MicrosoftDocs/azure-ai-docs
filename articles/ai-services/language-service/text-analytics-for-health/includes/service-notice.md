> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Text Analytics for health is a capability provided “AS IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS.” Text Analytics for health is not intended or made available for use as a medical device, clinical support, diagnostic tool, or other technology intended to be used in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or other conditions, and no license or right is granted by Microsoft to use this capability for such purposes. This capability is not designed or intended to be implemented or deployed as a substitute for professional medical advice or healthcare opinion, diagnosis, treatment, or the clinical judgment of a healthcare professional, and should not be used as such. The customer is solely responsible for any use of Text Analytics for health. The customer must separately license any and all source vocabularies it intends to use under the terms set for that [UMLS Metathesaurus License Agreement Appendix](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/release/license_agreement_appendix.html) or any future equivalent link. The customer is responsible for ensuring compliance with those license terms, including any geographic or other applicable restrictions.

> Text Analytics for health now allows extraction of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and ethnicity mentions in text. This capability may not cover all potential SDOH and does not derive inferences based on SDOH or ethnicity (for example, substance use information is surfaced, but substance abuse is not inferred). All decisions leveraging outputs of the Text Analytics for health that impact individuals or resource allocation (including, but not limited to, those related to billing, human resources, or treatment managing care) should be made with human oversight and not be based solely on the findings of the model. The purpose of the SDOH and ethnicity extraction capability is to help providers improve health outcomes and it should not be used to stigmatize or draw negative inferences about the users or consumers of SDOH data, or patient populations beyond the stated purpose of helping providers improving health outcomes.
