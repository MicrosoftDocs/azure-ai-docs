## Clean up resources

To clean up and remove an Azure AI resource, you can delete either the individual resource or the entire resource group. If you delete the resource group, all resources contained within are also deleted.

* [Azure portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
