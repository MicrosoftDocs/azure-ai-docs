* **An Azure subscription**. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
* **Requisite permissions**. Make sure the person establishing the account and project is assigned as the Azure AI Account Owner role at the subscription level. Alternatively, having either the **Contributor** or **Cognitive Services Contributor** role at the subscription scope also meets this requirement. For more information, *see* [Role based access control (RBAC)](/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control#cognitive-services-contributor).
* [**A Foundry resource**](/azure/ai-services/multi-service-resource) (recommended). For more information, *see* [Configure a Foundry resource](../../concepts/configure-azure-resources.md). Alternately, you can use a [Language resource](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_PIMCommon=true#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics).
* **A Foundry project created in the Foundry**. For more information, *see* [Create a Foundry project](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects).
