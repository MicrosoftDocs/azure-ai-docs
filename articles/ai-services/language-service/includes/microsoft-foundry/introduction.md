Microsoft Foundry offers a unified platform for building, managing, and deploying AI solutions with a wide array of models and tools. Foundry playgrounds are interactive environments within the Foundry portal designed for exploring, testing, and prototyping with various AI models and tools.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * If you already have an Azure Language in Foundry Tools or multi-service resource—whether used on its own or through Language Studio—you can continue to use those existing Language resources within the Microsoft Foundry portal.
> * For more information, see [How to use Foundry Tools in the Foundry portal](/azure/ai-services/connect-services-ai-foundry-portal).
> * We highly recommended that you use a Foundry resource in the Foundry; however, you can also follow these instructions using a Language resource.
