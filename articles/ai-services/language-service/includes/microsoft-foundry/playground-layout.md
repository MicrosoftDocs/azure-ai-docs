## Understanding the Language playground layout

The Language playground consists of four primary sections:

- **Top banner**: Select from the available Language capabilities including language detection, entity recognition, sentiment analysis, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection, summarization, and conversational language understanding.
- **Left pane**: Configure service options such as API version, model version, and capability-specific parameters (language selection, entity types, redaction policies).
- **Center pane**: Enter or upload text for processing. Results display here after you execute the operation.
- **Right pane**: View detailed operation results including entity categories, confidence scores, offsets, and JSON-formatted responses.

After processing your text, select **View code** to access multilingual code samples in Python, C#, JavaScript, and other languages for integration into your applications.
