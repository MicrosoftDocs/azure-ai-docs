## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure portal](../../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)



## Explore the REST API

To learn about automating your custom question answering pipeline consult the REST API documentation. Currently authoring functionality is only available via REST API:

* [Authoring API reference](/rest/api/questionanswering/question-answering-projects)
* [Authoring API cURL examples](../how-to/authoring.md)
* [Runtime API reference](/rest/api/questionanswering/question-answering)
