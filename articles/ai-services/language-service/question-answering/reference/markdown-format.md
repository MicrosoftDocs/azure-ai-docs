# Markdown format supported in answer text

Custom question answering stores answer text as markdown. There are many flavors of markdown. In order to make sure the answer text is returned and displayed correctly, use this reference.

Use the **[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/index.html)** tutorial to validate your markdown. The tutorial has a **Try it** feature for quick copy/paste validation.

## When to use rich-text editing versus markdown

Rich-text editing of answers allows you, as the author, to use a formatting toolbar to quickly select and format text.

Markdown is a better tool when you need to autogenerate content to create projects to be imported as part of a CI/CD pipeline or for batch testing.

## Supported markdown format

Following is the list of markdown formats that you can use in your answer text.

* Custom question answering doesn't process the image in any way. It is the client application's role to render the image.

If you want to add content using update/replace project APIs and the content/file contains html tags, you can preserve the HTML in your file by ensuring that opening and closing of the tags are converted in the encoded format.

| Preserve HTML  | Representation in the API request  | Representation in KB |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------|
| Yes | \&lt;br\&gt; | &lt;br&gt; |
| Yes | \&lt;h3\&gt;header\&lt;/h3\&gt; | &lt;h3&gt;header&lt;/h3&gt; |

Additionally, `CR LF(\r\n)` are converted to `\n` in the KB. `LF(\n)` is kept as is. If you want to escape any escape sequence like a \t or \n you can use backslash, for example: '\\\\r\\\\n' and '\\\\t'
