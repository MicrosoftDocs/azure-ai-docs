# Move projects and question answer pairs

> [!NOTE]

> This article deals with the process to export and move projects and sources from one Language resource to another.

You may want to create copies of your projects or sources for several reasons:

* To implement a backup and restore process
* Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline
* When you wish to move your data to different regions

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) before you begin.
* A [language resource](https://aka.ms/create-language-resource) with the custom question answering feature enabled in the Azure portal. Remember your Microsoft Entra ID, Subscription, and the Language resource name you selected when you created the resource.

## Export a project

Exporting a project allows you to back up all the question answer sources that are contained within a single project.

1. Sign in to the [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/).
1. Select the Language resource you want to move a project from.
1. Go to Custom Question Answering service. On the **Projects** page, you have the options to export in two formats, Excel or TSV. This will determine the contents of the file. The file itself will be exported as a .zip containing the contents of your project.
2. You can export only one project at a time.

## Import a project  

1. Select the Language resource, which will be the destination for your previously exported project.
1. Go to Custom Question Answering service. On the **Projects** page, select **Import** and choose the format used when you selected export. Then browse to the local .zip file containing your exported project. Enter a name for your newly imported project and select **Done**.

## Export sources

1. Select the language resource you want to move an individual question answer source from.
1. Select the project that contains the question and answer source you wish to export.
1. On the Edit project page, select the ellipsis (`...`) icon to the right of **Enable rich text** in the toolbar. You have the option to export in either Excel or TSV.

## Import question and answers

1. Select the language resource, which will be the destination for your previously exported question and answer source.
1. Select the project where you want to import a question and answer source.
1. On the Edit project page, select the ellipsis (`...`) icon to the right of **Enable rich text** in the toolbar. You have the option to import either an Excel or TSV file.
1. Browse to the local location of the file with the **Choose File** option and select **Done**.

### Test

**Test** the question answer source by selecting the **Test** option from the toolbar in the **Edit project** page which will launch the test panel. Learn how to [test your project](../../../qnamaker/How-To/test-knowledge-base.md).

### Deploy

<!-- TODO: Replace Link-->
**Deploy** the project and create a chat bot. Learn how to [deploy your project](../../../qnamaker/Quickstarts/create-publish-knowledge-base.md#publish-the-knowledge-base).

## Chat logs

There is no way to move chat logs with projects. If diagnostic logs are enabled, chat logs are stored in the associated Azure Monitor resource.
