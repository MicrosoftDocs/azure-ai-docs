# What is key phrase extraction in Azure AI Language?

Key phrase extraction is one of the features offered by [Azure AI Language](../overview.md), a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for developing intelligent applications that involve written language. Use key phrase extraction to quickly identify the main concepts in text. For example, in the text "*The food was delicious and the staff were wonderful.*", key phrase extraction returns the main topics: "*food*" and "*wonderful staff*."

This documentation contains the following types of articles:

* [**Quickstarts**](quickstart.md) are getting-started instructions to guide you through making requests to the service.
* [**How-to guides**](how-to/call-api.md) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.

## Responsible AI 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who use it, the people who are affected by it, and the environment in which it's deployed. Read the [transparency note for key phrase extraction](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/language-service/transparency-note-key-phrase-extraction) to learn about responsible AI use and deployment in your systems. For more information, see the following articles:

[!INCLUDE [Responsible AI links](../includes/overview-responsible-ai-links.md)]

## Next steps

There are two ways to get started using the entity linking feature:
* [Azure AI Foundry](../../../ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md) is a web-based platform that lets you use several Azure AI Language features without needing to write code.
* The [quickstart article](quickstart.md) for instructions on making requests to the service using the REST API and client library SDK.
