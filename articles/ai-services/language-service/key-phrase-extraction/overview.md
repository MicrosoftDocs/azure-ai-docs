# What is key phrase extraction in Azure Language in Foundry Tools?

Key phrase extraction is one of the features offered by [Azure Language in Foundry Tools](../overview.md). This capability is part of a suite of cloud-based machine learning and AI tools designed for building intelligent applications that process written language. Use key phrase extraction to quickly identify the main concepts in text. For example, in the text "*The food was delicious and the staff were wonderful.*", key phrase extraction returns the main topics: "*food*" and "*wonderful staff*."

This documentation contains the following types of articles:

* [**Quickstarts**](quickstart.md) are getting-started instructions to guide you through making requests to the service.
* [**How-to guides**](how-to/call-api.md) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.

## Responsible AI 

An AI system includes the technology, the individuals who operate the system, the people who experience its effects, and the broader environment where the system functions all play a role. Read the [transparency note for key phrase extraction](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/language-service/transparency-note-key-phrase-extraction) to learn about responsible AI use and deployment in your systems. For more information, see the following articles:

## Next steps

There are two ways to get started using the entity linking feature:
* [Microsoft Foundry](../../../ai-foundry/what-is-foundry.md) is a web-based platform that lets you use several Language features without needing to write code.
* The [quickstart article](quickstart.md) for instructions on making requests to the service using the REST API and client library SDK.
