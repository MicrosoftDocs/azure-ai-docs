To use summarization, you submit for analysis and handle the API output in your application. Analysis is performed as-is, with no added customization to the model used on your data. There are two ways to use summarization:

# [Text summarization](#tab/text-summarization)

|Development option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft Foundry     | Foundry is a web-based platform that lets you use entity linking with text examples with your own data when you sign up. For more information, see the [Foundry website](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) or [Foundry documentation](../../../../ai-foundry/what-is-foundry.md).         |
|REST API or Client library (Azure SDK)      | Integrate text summarization into your applications using the REST API, or the client library available in various languages. For more information, see the [summarization quickstart](../quickstart.md).        |


# [Conversation summarization](#tab/conversation-summarization)

|Development option  |Description  | Links |
|---------|---------|---------|
| REST API     | Integrate conversation summarization into your applications using the REST API. | [Quickstart: Use conversation summarization](../quickstart.md?tabs=conversation-summarization&pivots=rest-api) |

# [Document summarization](#tab/document-summarization)

|Development option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Foundry     | Foundry is a web-based platform that lets you use entity linking with text examples with your own data when you sign up.
