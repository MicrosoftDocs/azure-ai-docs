Use this quickstart to create a text summarization application with the client library for .NET. In the following example, you'll create a C# application that can summarize documents or text-based customer service conversations.

[!INCLUDE [Use Language Studio](../use-language-studio.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* The [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, [create an AI services resource](../../../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#create-a-new-azure-ai-services-resource).
    * You'll need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You paste your key and endpoint into the code later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you'll need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.

## Setting up

[!INCLUDE [Create environment variables](../../../includes/environment-variables.md)]


### Create a new .NET Core application

Using the Visual Studio IDE, create a new .NET Core console app. This creates a "Hello World" project with a single C# source file: *program.cs*.

# [Text summarization](#tab/text-summarization)

Install the client library by right-clicking on the solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse** and search for `Azure.AI.TextAnalytics`. Make sure **Include prerelease** is checked. Select version `5.3.0`, and then **Install**. You can also use the [Package Manager Console](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell#find-and-install-a-package).

# [Conversation summarization](#tab/conversation-summarization)

Install the client library by right-clicking on the solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse** and search for `Azure.AI.Language.Conversations`. Make sure **Include prerelease** is checked. Select version `1.1.0`, and then **Install**. You can also use the [Package Manager Console](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell#find-and-install-a-package).


# [Document summarization](#tab/document-summarization)

Install the client library by right-clicking on the solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse** and search for `Azure.AI.TextAnalytics`. Make sure **Include prerelease** is checked. Select version `5.3.0`, and then **Install**. You can also use the [Package Manager Console](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell#find-and-install-a-package).

Copy the following code into your *program.cs* file. Then run the code.
