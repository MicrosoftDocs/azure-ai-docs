Use this quickstart to create a text summarization application with the client library for Python. In the following example, you'll create a Python application that can summarize documents or text-based customer service conversations.

[!INCLUDE [Use Language Studio](../use-language-studio.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, [create an AI services resource](../../../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#create-a-new-azure-ai-services-resource).
    * You'll need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you'll need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.


## Setting up

[!INCLUDE [Create environment variables](../../../includes/environment-variables.md)]


### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

# [Text summarization](#tab/text-summarization)

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.3.0
```

# [Conversation summarization](#tab/conversation-summarization)

```console
pip install azure-ai-language-conversations==1.1.0
```

# [Document summarization](#tab/document-summarization)

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.3.0
```

---

## Code example

Create a new Python file and copy the below code. Then run the code.  

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

# [Text summarization](#tab/text-summarization)

```python
# This example requires environment variables named "LANGUAGE_KEY" and "LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT"
key = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE_KEY')
endpoint = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT')

from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Authenticate the client using your key and endpoint 
def authenticate_client():
    ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
            endpoint=endpoint, 
            credential=ta_credential)
    return text_analytics_client

client = authenticate_client()

# Example method for summarizing text
def sample_extractive_summarization(client):
    from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
    from azure.ai.textanalytics import (
        TextAnalyticsClient,
        ExtractiveSummaryAction
    ) 

    document = [
        "The extractive summarization feature uses natural language processing techniques to locate key sentences in an unstructured text document. "
        "These sentences collectively convey the main idea of the document. This feature is provided as an API for developers. " 
        "They can use it to build intelligent solutions based on the relevant information extracted to support various use cases. "
        "Extractive summarization supports several languages. It is based on pretrained multilingual transformer models, part of our quest for holistic representations. "
        "It draws its strength from transfer learning across monolingual and harness the shared nature of languages to produce models of improved quality and efficiency. "
    ]

    poller = client.begin_analyze_actions(
        document,
        actions=[
            ExtractiveSummaryAction(max_sentence_count=4)
        ],
    )

    document_results = poller.result()
    for result in document_results:
        extract_summary_result = result[0]  # first document, first result
        if extract_summary_result.is_error:
            print("...Is an error with code '{}' and message '{}'".format(
                extract_summary_result.code, extract_summary_result.message
            ))
        else:
            print("Summary extracted: \n{}".format(
                " ".join([sentence.text for sentence in extract_summary_result.sentences]))
            )

sample_extractive_summarization(client)
```



### Output

```console

The extractive summarization feature uses natural language processing techniques to locate key sentences in an unstructured text document. This feature is provided as an API for developers. They can use it to build intelligent solutions based on the relevant information extracted to support various use cases.
