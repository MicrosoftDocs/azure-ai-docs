# How to detect and redact Personally Identifying Information (PII)

The PII feature can evaluate unstructured text, extract, and redact sensitive information (PII) and health information (PHI) in text across several [predefined categories](concepts/entity-categories.md).


## Development options

[!INCLUDE [development options](./includes/development-options.md)]

## Determine how to process the data (optional)

### Specify the PII detection model

By default, this feature uses the latest available AI model on your text. You can also configure your API requests to use a specific [model version](../concepts/model-lifecycle.md).

### Input languages

When you submit documents to be processed, you can specify which of [the supported languages](language-support.md) they're written in. If you don't specify a language, extraction defaults to English. The API may return offsets in the response to support different [multilingual and emoji encodings](../concepts/multilingual-emoji-support.md). 

### Redaction Policy (version 2024-11-5-preview only)
In version 2024-11-5-preview, you're able to define the `redactionPolicy` parameter to reflect the redaction policy to be used when redacting text. The policy field supports three policy types:

- `DoNotRedact` 
- `MaskWithCharacter` (default) 
- `MaskWithEntityType` 

The `DoNotRedact` policy allows the user to return the response without the `redactedText` field, that is, “John Doe received a call from 424-878-9192”. 

The `MaskWithRedactionCharacter` policy allows the `redactedText` to be masked with a character (such as "*"), preserving the length and offset of the original text, that is, “******** received a call from ************”. This is the existing behavior.

There's also an optional field called `redactionCharacter` where you can input the character to be used in redaction if you're using the `MaskWithCharacter` policy 

The `MaskWithEntityType` policy allows you to mask the detected PII entity text with the detected entity type, that is, “[PERSON_1] received a call from [PHONENUMBER_1]”. 

## Submitting data

Analysis is performed upon receipt of the request. Using the PII detection feature synchronously is stateless. No data is stored in your account, and results are returned immediately in the response.

[!INCLUDE [asynchronous-result-availability](../includes/async-result-availability.md)]

## Select which entities to be returned

The API attempts to detect the [defined entity categories](concepts/entity-categories.md) for a given document language. If you want to specify which entities are detected and returned, use the optional `piiCategories` parameter with the appropriate entity categories. This parameter can also let you detect entities that aren't enabled by default for your document language. The following example would detect only `Person`. You can specify one or more [entity types](concepts/entity-categories.md) to be returned.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't include `default` when specifying entity categories, The API only returns the entity categories you specify.

**Input:**

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, it returns only the **person** entity type:

```bash
{
    "kind": "PiiEntityRecognition",
    "parameters": 
    {
        "modelVersion": "latest",
        "piiCategories" :
        [

        ]
    },
    "analysisInput":

                "language": "en",
                "text": "We went to Contoso foodplace located at downtown Seattle last week for a dinner party, and we adore the spot! They provide marvelous food and they have a great menu. The chief cook happens to be the owner (I think his name is John Doe) and he is super nice, coming out of the kitchen and greeted us all. We enjoyed very much dining in the place! The pasta I ordered was tender and juicy, and the place was impeccably clean. You can even pre-order from their online menu at www.contosofoodplace.com, call 112-555-0176 or send email to order@contosofoodplace.com! The only complaint I have is the food didn't come fast enough. Overall I highly recommend it!"

    },

        "redactionPolicy": {

             //MaskWithCharacter|MaskWithEntityType|DoNotRedact 
            "redactionCharacter": "*"  
}

```

**Output:**

```bash

                        "confidenceScore": 0.98

        ],
        "errors": [],
        "modelVersion": "2021-01-15"
    }
}
```

## Getting PII results

When you get results from PII detection, you can stream the results to an application or save the output to a file on the local system. The API response includes [recognized entities](concepts/entity-categories.md), including their categories and subcategories, and confidence scores. The text string with the PII entities redacted is also returned.
