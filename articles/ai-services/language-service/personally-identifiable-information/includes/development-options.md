To use PII detection, you submit text for analysis and handle the API output in your application. Analysis is performed as-is, with no customization to the model used on your data. There are two ways to use PII detection:


|Development option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[**Microsoft Foundry (new)**](https://ai.azure.com/) portal| Foundry (new) is a cloud-based AI platform that provides streamlined access to Foundry models, agents, and tools through Foundry projects.
|[**Foundry (classic)**](https://ai.azure.com/) portal| Foundry (classic) is a cloud-based platform that supports hub-based projects and other resource types. When you sign up, you can use your own data to detect personally identifying information within text examples.|
|[**REST API or Client library (Azure SDK)**](/rest/api/language/analyze-text/analyze-text/analyze-text)| Integrate PII detection into your applications using the REST API, or the client library available in various languages.|
