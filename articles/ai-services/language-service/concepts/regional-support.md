# Language service supported regions

The Language service is available for use in several Azure regions. Use this article to learn about the regional support and limitations. 

## Region support overview 

Typically you can refer to the [region support](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=cognitive-services) for details, and most Language service capabilities are available in all supported regions. Some Language service capabilities, however, are only available in select regions which are listed below. 

> [!NOTE]
> Language service doesn't store or process customer data outside the region you deploy the service instance in.

## Conversational language understanding and orchestration workflow

Conversational language understanding and orchestration workflow are only available in some Azure regions. Some regions are available for **both authoring and prediction**, while other regions are **prediction only**. Language resources in authoring regions allow you to create, edit, train, and deploy your projects. Language resources in prediction regions allow you to get [predictions from a deployment](./custom-features/multi-region-deployment.md).
