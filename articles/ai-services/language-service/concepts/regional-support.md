# Language supported regions

The Language is available for use in several Azure regions. Use this article to learn about the regional support and limitations.

## Region support overview

Typically you can refer to the [region support](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=cognitive-services) for details, and most Language capabilities are available in all supported regions. Some Language capabilities, however, are only available in select regions.

> [!NOTE]
> Language doesn't store or process customer data outside the region you deploy the service instance in.

## Conversational language understanding and orchestration workflow

Conversational language understanding and orchestration workflow are only available in some Azure regions. Some regions are available for **both authoring and prediction**, while other regions are **prediction only**. Language resources in authoring regions allow you to create, edit, train, and deploy your projects. Language resources in prediction regions allow you to get [predictions from a deployment](./custom-features/multi-region-deployment.md).

### Data augmentation feature in Custom Named Entity Recognition

The data augmentation capability allows users to use an Azure OpenAI model to generate supplementary training data during the creation of a custom named entity recognition model. This functionality is currently limited to select regions.

* All entity data utilized with data augmentation is required to include a description field.
* Supported Azure OpenAI model types for this feature are gpt-4o and gpt-4 32k.
* The language resource must also have the **Azure OpenAI Contributor** role assigned on the Azure OpenAI resource.
