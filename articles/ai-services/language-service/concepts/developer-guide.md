# SDK and REST developer guide for the Language service

Use this article to find information on integrating the Language service SDKs and REST API into your applications. 

## Development options

The Language service provides support through a REST API, and client libraries in several languages.

# [Client library (Azure SDK)](#tab/language-studio)

## Client libraries (Azure SDK)

The Language service provides three namespaces for using the available features. Depending on which features and programming language you're using, you will need to download one or more of the following packages, and have the following framework/language version support:

|Framework/Language  | Minimum supported version  |
|---------|---------|
|.NET     | .NET Framework 4.6.1 or newer, or .NET (formerly .NET Core) 2.0 or newer.       |
|Java     | v8 or later        |
|JavaScript     | v14 LTS or later        |
|Python| v3.7 or later        |

### Azure.AI.TextAnalytics  

>[!NOTE] 
> If you're using custom named entity recognition or custom text classification, you will need to create a project and train a model before using the SDK. The SDK only provides the ability to analyze text using models you create. See the following quickstarts for information on creating a model. 
> * [Custom named entity recognition](../custom-named-entity-recognition/quickstart.md)
> * [Custom text classification](../custom-text-classification/quickstart.md)

The `Azure.AI.TextAnalytics` namespace enables you to use the following Language features. Use the links below for articles to help you send API requests using the SDK.

* [Custom named entity recognition](../custom-named-entity-recognition/how-to/call-api.md?tabs=client#send-an-entity-recognition-request-to-your-model)
* [Custom text classification](../custom-text-classification/how-to/call-api.md?tabs=client-libraries#send-a-text-classification-request-to-your-model)
* [Document summarization](../summarization/quickstart.md)
* [Entity linking](../entity-linking/quickstart.md)
* [Key phrase extraction](../key-phrase-extraction/quickstart.md)
* [Named entity recognition (NER)](../named-entity-recognition/quickstart.md)
* [Personally Identifying Information (PII) detection](../personally-identifiable-information/quickstart.md)
* [Sentiment analysis and opinion mining](../sentiment-opinion-mining/quickstart.md)
* [Text analytics for health](../text-analytics-for-health/quickstart.md)

As you use these features in your application, use the following documentation and code samples for additional information.

### Azure.AI.Language.Conversations 

> [!NOTE] 
> If you're using conversational language understanding or orchestration workflow, you will need to create a project and train a model before using the SDK. The SDK only provides the ability to analyze text using models you create. See the following quickstarts for more information. 
> * [Conversational language understanding](../conversational-language-understanding/quickstart.md)
> * [Orchestration workflow](../orchestration-workflow/quickstart.md)

The `Azure.AI.Language.Conversations` namespace enables you to use the following Language features. Use the links below for articles to help you send API requests using the SDK.
