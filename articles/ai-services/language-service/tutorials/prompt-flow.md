[Prompt flow in Azure AI Foundry portal](../../../ai-studio/how-to/prompt-flow.md) is a development tool designed to streamline the entire development cycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). You can explore and quickly start to use and fine-tune various natural language processing capabilities from Azure AI Language, reducing your time to value and deploying solutions with reliable evaluation.

This tutorial teaches you how to use Language in prompt flow utilizing [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com).                            

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.

- You need an Azure AI Foundry hub or permissions to create one. Your user role must be **Azure AI Developer**, **Contributor**, or **Owner** on the hub. For more information, see [hubs](../../../ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources.md) and [Azure AI roles](../../../ai-studio/concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).
     - If your role is **Contributor** or **Owner**, you can [create a hub in this tutorial](#create-a-project-in-azure-ai-foundry-portal). 
     - If your role is **Azure AI Developer**, the hub must already be created. 

- Your subscription needs to be below your [quota limit](../../../ai-studio/how-to/quota.md) to deploy a new flow in this tutorial.

## Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal

Your project is used to organize your work and save state. 

[!INCLUDE [Create project](../../../ai-studio/includes/create-projects.md)]

## Using Azure AI Language via the prompt flow gallery

You can create an Azure AI Language flow by either cloning the samples available in the gallery or creating a flow from scratch. If you already have flow files in local or file share, you can also import the files to create a flow. For the purposes of this tutorial we'll be using the prebuilt **Analyze Conversations** flow.

To create a prompt flow from the gallery in Azure AI Foundry portal:

1. Sign in to Azure AI Foundry and select your project.

1. From the collapsible left menu, select Prompt flow.

1. Select + Create.

1. Find the **Analyze Conversations** tile in the gallery and select *Clone*.

1. In the right sidebar, name the folder and click the **Clone** button.

1. After the process is complete, you'll be taken to the prompt flow wizard. Click **Start Compute Session** in the upper right hand corner to begin. The various parts of the wizard are out lined below:

    1. A graph view of your flow.
    1. Files in your flow. Click the arrow to expand this section.
    1. Azure AI Language tools in the "More tools" dropdown menu, which you can add capabilities that you need for your flow. There are more tools that you can add from LLM, Prompt, and Python menu. This menu is only accessible after the compute session has started.
    1. Configure your output.
    1. Configure steps (or tools) in the flow.
    1. Run, evaluate, and deploy your flow.

1. Once you've configured everything to your liking, press the run button in the upper right hand corner.
