4. Submit the `POST` cURL request in your terminal or command prompt. You'll receive a 202 response with the API results if the request was successful.

5. In the response header you receive extract `{JOB-ID}` from `operation-location`, which has the format: `{ENDPOINT}/text/analytics/v3.2-preview.2/analyze/jobs/<JOB-ID}>`

6. Back to Language Studio; select **Retrieve** pivot from the same window you got the example request you got earlier and copy the sample request into a text editor.

7. Replace `<JOB-ID>` with the `{JOB-ID}` you extracted from the previous step. 

8. Submit the `GET` cURL request in your terminal or command prompt.
