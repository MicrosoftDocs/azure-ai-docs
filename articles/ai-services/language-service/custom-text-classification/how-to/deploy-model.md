# Deploy a model and classify text using the runtime API

Once you are satisfied with how your model performs, it is ready to be deployed; and use it to classify text. Deploying a model makes it available for use through the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger).

## Prerequisites

* [A custom text classification project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure storage account,
* Text data that has [been uploaded](design-schema.md#data-preparation) to your storage account.
* [Labeled data](tag-data.md) and successfully [trained model](train-model.md)
* Reviewed the [model evaluation details](view-model-evaluation.md) to determine how your model is performing.

See the [project development lifecycle](../overview.md#project-development-lifecycle) for more information.

## Deploy model

After you have reviewed your model's performance and decided it can be used in your environment, you need to assign it to a deployment to be able to query it. Assigning the model to a deployment makes it available for use through the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger). It is recommended to create a deployment named `production` to which you assign the best model you have built so far and use it in your system. You can create another deployment called `staging` to which you can assign the model you're currently working on to be able to test it. You can have a maximum on 10 deployments in your project. 

# [Language Studio](#tab/language-studio)

[!INCLUDE [Deploy a model using Language Studio](../includes/language-studio/deploy-model.md)]
   
# [REST APIs](#tab/rest-api)

### Submit deployment job

[!INCLUDE [deploy model](../includes/rest-api/deploy-model.md)]

### Get deployment job status

[!INCLUDE [get deployment status](../includes/rest-api/get-deployment-status.md)]

## Swap deployments

You can swap deployments after you've tested a model assigned to one deployment, and want to assign it to another. Swapping deployments involves taking the model assigned to the first deployment, and assigning it to the second deployment. Then taking the model assigned to second deployment and assign it to the first deployment. This could be used to swap your `production` and `staging` deployments when you want to take the model assigned to `staging` and assign it to `production`.

## Delete deployment

# [Language Studio](#tab/language-studio)

[!INCLUDE [Delete deployment](../includes/language-studio/delete-deployment.md)]

# [REST APIs](#tab/rest-api)

[!INCLUDE [Delete deployment](../includes/rest-api/delete-deployment.md)]

## Assign deployment resources

You can [deploy your project to multiple regions](../../concepts/custom-features/multi-region-deployment.md) by assigning different Language resources that exist in different regions.

# [Language Studio](#tab/language-studio)

[!INCLUDE [Assign resource](../../conversational-language-understanding/includes/language-studio/assign-resources.md)]

# [REST APIs](#tab/rest-api)

[!INCLUDE [Assign resource](../includes/rest-api/assign-resources.md)]

---

## Unassign deployment resources

When you unassign or remove a deployment resource from a project, you will also delete all the deployments that have been deployed to that resource's region.

# [Language Studio](#tab/language-studio)

[!INCLUDE [Unassign resource](../../conversational-language-understanding/includes/language-studio/unassign-resources.md)]

# [REST APIs](#tab/rest-api)

[!INCLUDE [Unassign resource](../includes/rest-api/unassign-resources.md)]

* Use [prediction API to query your model](call-api.md)
