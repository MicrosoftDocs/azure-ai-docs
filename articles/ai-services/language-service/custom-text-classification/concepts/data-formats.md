# Accepted data formats

If you're trying to import your data into custom text classification, it has to follow a specific format. If you don't have data to import you can [create your project](../how-to/create-project.md) and use Language Studio to [label your documents](../how-to/tag-data.md).

## Labels file format

Your Labels file should be in the `json` format below. This will enable you to [import](../how-to/create-project.md#import-a-custom-text-classification-project) your labels into a project.

# [Multi label classification](#tab/multi-classification)

```json
{
    "projectFileVersion": "2022-05-01",
    "stringIndexType": "Utf16CodeUnit",
    "metadata": {
        "projectKind": "CustomMultiLabelClassification",
        "storageInputContainerName": "{CONTAINER-NAME}",
        "projectName": "{PROJECT-NAME}",
        "multilingual": false,
        "description": "Project-description",
        "language": "en-us"
    },

            },
            {
                "category": "Class2"
            }
        ],
        "documents": [

                    {
                        "category": "Class2"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

|Key  |Placeholder  |Value  | Example |

| multilingual | `true`| A boolean value that enables you to have documents in multiple languages in your dataset and when your model is deployed you can query the model in any supported language (not necessarily included in your training documents).

| documents | [] | Array containing all the documents in your project and the classes labeled for this document. | [] |
| location | `{DOCUMENT-NAME}` |  The location of the documents in the storage container. Since all the documents are in the root of the container, this value should be the document name.|`doc1.txt`|

## Next steps

* You can import your labeled data into your project directly. See [How to create a project](../how-to/create-project.md#import-a-custom-text-classification-project) to learn more about importing projects.
* See the [how-to article](../how-to/tag-data.md) more information about labeling your data. When you're done labeling your data, you can [train your model](../how-to/train-model.md).
