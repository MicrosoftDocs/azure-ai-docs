# Tutorial: Triage incoming emails with power automate

In this tutorial you will categorize and triage incoming email using custom text classification. Using this [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started) flow, when a new email is received, its contents will have a classification applied, and depending on the result, a message will be sent to a designated channel on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams).


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">A Language resource </a>
    * A trained [custom text classification](../overview.md) model.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from your Language resource to authenticate your Power Automate flow.
* A successfully created and deployed [single text classification custom model](../quickstart.md)


## Create a Power Automate flow

1. [Sign in to power automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/)

2. From the left side menu, select **My flows** and create a **Automated cloud flow**

6. Search for *CustomSingleLabelClassification*.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/single-classification.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Classification connector." lightbox="../media/single-classification.png":::

7. Start by adding the right connection to your connector. This connection will be used to access the classification project.

8. In the documents ID field, add **1**.

9. In the documents text field, add **body** from **dynamic content**.

10. Fill in the project name and deployment name of your deployed custom text classification model.

11. Add a condition to send a Microsoft Teams message to the right team by:
    1. Select **results** from **dynamic content**, and add the condition. For this tutorial, we are looking for `Computer_science` related emails. In the **Yes** condition, choose your desired option to notify a team channel. In the **No** condition, you can add additional conditions to perform alternative actions.
