# What is Azure AI Language?

Azure AI Language is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text. Use this service to help build intelligent applications using the web-based Language Studio, REST APIs, and client libraries.

## Available features

This Language service unifies the following previously available Azure AI services: Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and LUIS. If you need to migrate from these services, see [the migration section](#migrate-from-text-analytics-qna-maker-or-language-understanding-luis).

The Language service also provides several new features as well, which can either be:

* Preconfigured, which means the AI models that the feature uses aren't customizable. You just send your data, and use the feature's output in your applications.
* Customizable, which means you train an AI model using our tools to fit your data specifically.

Language features are also utilized in [agent templates](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/samples/agent-catalog):

* [Intent routing agent](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/samples/agent-catalog/msft-agent-samples/foundry-agent-service-sdk/intent-routing-agent) detects user intent and provides exact answering. Perfect for deterministically intent routing and exact question answering with human controls.
* [Exact question answering agent](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/samples/agent-catalog/msft-agent-samples/foundry-agent-service-sdk/exact-qna-agent) answers high-value predefined questions deterministically to ensure consistent and accurate responses.

> [!TIP]
> Unsure which feature to use? See [Which Language service feature should I use](#which-language-service-feature-should-i-use) to help you decide.

[**Azure AI Foundry**](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) enables you to use most of the following service features without needing to write code.

\* If a feature is customizable, you can train an AI model using our tools to fit your data specifically. Otherwise a feature is preconfigured, meaning the AI models it uses can't be changed. You just send your data, and use the feature's output in your applications.

## Migrate from Text Analytics, QnA Maker, or Language Understanding (LUIS)

Azure AI Language unifies three individual language services in Azure AI services - Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and Language Understanding (LUIS). If you have been using these three services, you can easily migrate to the new Azure AI Language. For instructions see [Migrating to Azure AI Language](concepts/migrate.md).

## Deploy on premises using Docker containers
Use Language service containers to deploy API features on-premises. These Docker containers enable you to bring the service closer to your data for compliance, security, or other operational reasons. The Language service offers the following containers:

* [Sentiment analysis](sentiment-opinion-mining/how-to/use-containers.md)
* [Language detection](language-detection/how-to/use-containers.md)
* [Key phrase extraction](key-phrase-extraction/how-to/use-containers.md)
* [Custom Named Entity Recognition](custom-named-entity-recognition/how-to/use-containers.md)
* [Text Analytics for health](text-analytics-for-health/how-to/use-containers.md)
* [Summarization](summarization/how-to/use-containers.md)

## Responsible AI

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who use it, the people affected by it, and the deployment environment. Read the following articles to learn about responsible AI use and deployment in your systems:
