# How to use language detection

The Language Detection feature can evaluate text, and return a language identifier that indicates the language a document was written in.

Language detection is useful for content stores that collect arbitrary text, where language is unknown. You can parse the results of this analysis to determine which language is used in the input document. The response also returns a score between 0 and 1 that reflects the confidence of the model.

The Language Detection feature can detect a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional or cultural languages.

## Development options

[!INCLUDE [development options](../includes/development-options.md)]

## Determine how to process the data (optional)

### Specify the language detection model

By default, language detection will use the latest available AI model on your text. You can also configure your API requests to use a specific [model version](../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md).

### Input languages

When you submit documents to be evaluated, language detection will attempt to determine if the text was written in any of [the supported languages](../language-support.md).  

If you have content expressed in a less frequently used language, you can try the Language Detection feature to see if it returns a code. The response for languages that can't be detected is `unknown`.

## Submitting data

> [!TIP]
> You can use a [Docker container](use-containers.md)for language detection, so you can use the API on-premises.

Analysis is performed upon receipt of the request. Using the language detection feature synchronously is stateless. No data is stored in your account, and results are returned immediately in the response.

[!INCLUDE [asynchronous-result-availability](../../includes/async-result-availability.md)]


## Getting language detection results

When you get results from language detection, you can stream the results to an application or save the output to a file on the local system.

Language detection will return one predominant language for each document you submit, along with it's [ISO 639-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/22109.html) name, a human-readable name, a confidence score, script name and script code according to the [ISO 15924 standard](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924). A positive score of 1 indicates the highest possible confidence level of the analysis.


### Ambiguous content

In some cases it may be hard to disambiguate languages based on the input. You can use the `countryHint` parameter to specify an [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country/region code. By default the API uses "US" as the default country hint. To remove this behavior, you can reset this parameter by setting this value to empty string `countryHint = ""` .

For example, "communication" is common to both English and French and if given with limited context the response will be based on the "US" country/region hint. If the origin of the text is known to be coming from France that can be given as a hint.

> [!NOTE] 
> Ambiguous content can cause confidence scores to be lower.
> The `countryHint` in the response is only applicable if the confidence score is less than 0.8.

**Input**

```json
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "text": "communication"
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "text": "communication",
            "countryHint": "fr"
        }
    ]
}
```

With the second document, the language detection model has additional context to make a better judgment because it contains the `countryHint` property in the input above. This will return the following output.
 

**Output**

```json
{
    "documents":[
        {
            "detectedLanguage":{
                "confidenceScore":0.62,
                "iso6391Name":"en",
                "name":"English"
            },
            "id":"1",
            "warnings":[
                
            ]
        },
        {
            "detectedLanguage":{
                "confidenceScore":1.0,
                "iso6391Name":"fr",
                "name":"French"
            },
            "id":"2",
            "warnings":[
                
            ]
        }
    ],
    "errors":[
        
    ],
    "modelVersion":"2022-10-01"
}
```

If the analyzer can't parse the input, it returns `(Unknown)`. An example is if you submit a text string that consists solely of numbers.

```json
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "detectedLanguage": {
                "name": "(Unknown)",
                "iso6391Name": "(Unknown)",
                "confidenceScore": 0.0
            },
            "warnings": []
        }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2023-12-01"
}
```

### Mixed-language content

Mixed-language content within the same document returns the language with the largest representation in the content, but with a lower positive rating. The rating reflects the marginal strength of the assessment. In the following example, input is a blend of English, Spanish, and French. The analyzer counts characters in each segment to determine the predominant language.

**Input**

```json
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "text": "Hello, I would like to take a class at your University. ¿Se ofrecen clases en español? Es mi primera lengua y más fácil para escribir. Que diriez-vous des cours en français?"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Output**

The resulting output consists of the predominant language, with a score of less than 1.0, which indicates a weaker level of confidence.

```json
{
    "kind": "LanguageDetectionResults",
    "results": {
        "documents": [
            {
                "id": "1",
                "detectedLanguage": {
                    "name": "Spanish",
                    "iso6391Name": "es",
                    "confidenceScore": 0.97,
                    "script": "Latin",
                    "scriptCode": "Latn"
                },
                "warnings": []
            }
        ],
        "errors": [],
        "modelVersion": "2023-12-01"
    }
}
```

## Script name and script code

> [!NOTE]
> * Script detection is currently limited to [select languages](../language-support.md#script-detection).  
> * The script detection is only available for textual input which is greater than 12 characters in length.

Language detection offers the ability to detect more than one script per language according to the [ISO 15924 standard](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924). Specifically, Language Detection returns two script-related properties:

* `script`: The human-readable name of the identified script
* `scriptCode`: The ISO 15924 code for the identified script

The output of the API includes the value of the `scriptCode` property for documents that are at least 12 characters or greater in length and matches the list of supported languages and scripts. Script detection is designed to benefit users whose language can be transliterated or written in more than one script, such as Kazakh or Hindi language.

Previously, language detection was designed to detect the language of documents in a wide variety of languages, dialects, and regional variants, but was limited by "Romanization". Romanization refers to conversion of text from one writing system to the Roman (Latin) script, and is necessary to detect many Indo-European languages. However, there are other languages which are written in multiple scripts, such as Kazakh, which can be written in Cyrillic, Perso-Arabic, and Latin scripts. There are also other cases in which users may either choose or are required to transliterate their language in more than one script, such as Hindi transliterated in Latin script, due to the limited availability of keyboards which support its Devanagari script.  

Consequently, language detection's expanded support for script detection behaves as follows:

**Input**

```json
{ 
    "kind": "LanguageDetection", 
    "parameters": { 
        "modelVersion": "latest" 
    }, 
    "analysisInput": { 
        "documents": [ 
            { 
                "id": "1", 
                "text": "आप कहाँ जा रहे हैं?" 
            }, 
            { 
                "id": "2", 
                "text": "Туған жерім менің - Қазақстаным" 
            } 
        ] 
    } 
} 
```

**Output**

The resulting output consists of the predominant language, along with a script name, script code, and confidence score.

```json

    "kind": "LanguageDetectionResults", 
    "results": { 
        "documents": [

                    "name": "Hindi", 
                    "iso6391Name": "hi", 
                    "confidenceScore": 1.0, 
                    "script": "Devanagari", 
                    "scriptCode": "Deva" 
                }, 
                "warnings": [] 
            },

                    "confidenceScore": 1.0, 
                    "script": "Cyrillic",  
                    "scriptCode": "Cyrl" 
                }, 
                "warnings": [] 
            } 
        ], 
        "errors": [], 
        "modelVersion": "2023-12-01" 
    } 
}
```
