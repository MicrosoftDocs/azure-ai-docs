# Data formats accepted by conversational language understanding

If you're uploading your data into conversational language understanding, it must follow a specific format. Use this article to learn more about accepted data formats.

## Import project file format

If you're [importing a project](../how-to/create-project.md#import-project) into conversational language understanding, the file uploaded must be in the following format:

```json
{
  "projectFileVersion": "2022-10-01-preview",
  "stringIndexType": "Utf16CodeUnit",
  "metadata": {
    "projectKind": "Conversation",
    "projectName": "{PROJECT-NAME}",
    "multilingual": true,
    "description": "DESCRIPTION",
    "language": "{LANGUAGE-CODE}",
    "settings": {
            "confidenceThreshold": 0
        }
  },
  "assets": {
    "projectKind": "Conversation",
    "intents": [
      {
        "category": "intent1"
      }
    ],
    "entities": [
      {
        "category": "entity1",
        "compositionSetting": "{COMPOSITION-SETTING}",

              ]
            }            
          ]
        },
        "prebuilts": [
          {
            "category": "{PREBUILT-COMPONENTS}"
          }
        ],
        "regex": {

|Key  |Placeholder  |Value  | Example |
|---------|---------|----------|--|
|`{API-VERSION}`     | The [version](../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md#api-versions) of the API you're calling. | `2023-04-01` |
|`confidenceThreshold`|`{CONFIDENCE-THRESHOLD}`|This is the threshold score below which the intent is predicted as [None intent](none-intent.md). Values are from `0` to `1`.|`0.7`|
| `projectName` | `{PROJECT-NAME}` | The name of your project. This value is case sensitive. | `EmailApp` |
| `multilingual` | `true`| A Boolean value that enables you to have utterances in multiple languages in your dataset. When your model is deployed, you can query the model in any supported language (not necessarily included in your training documents. For more information about supported language codes, see [Language support](../language-support.md#multi-lingual-option). | `true`|
|`sublists`|`[]`|Array that contains sublists. Each sublist is a key and its associated values.|`[]`|
|`compositionSetting`|`{COMPOSITION-SETTING}`|Rule that defines how to manage multiple components in your entity. Options are `combineComponents` or `separateComponents`. |`combineComponents`|
|`synonyms`|`[]`|Array that contains all the synonyms.|synonym|
| `language` | `{LANGUAGE-CODE}` |  A string specifying the language code for the utterances, synonyms, and regular expressions used in your project. If your project is a multilingual project, choose the [language code](../language-support.md) of most the utterances. |`en-us`|
| `intents` | `[]` | Array that contains all the intents you have in the project. These intents are classified from your utterances.| `[]` |
| `entities` | `[]` | Array that contains all the entities in your project. These entities are extracted from your utterances. Every entity can have other optional components defined with them: list, prebuilt, or regex. | `[]` |
| `dataset` | `{DATASET}` |  The test set to which this utterance goes to when it's split before training. To learn more about data splitting, see [Train your conversational language understanding model](../how-to/train-model.md#data-splitting). Possible values for this field are `Train` and `Test`.      |`Train`|
| `category` | ` ` |  The type of entity associated with the span of text specified. | `Entity1`|
| `offset` | ` ` |  The inclusive character position of the start of the entity.      |`5`|
| `length` | ` ` |  The character length of the entity.      |`5`|
| `listKey`| ` ` | A normalized value for the list of synonyms to map back to in prediction. | `Microsoft` |
| `values`| `{VALUES-FOR-LIST}` | A list of comma-separated strings that are matched exactly for extraction and map to the list key. | `"msft", "microsoft", "MS"` |
| `regexKey`| `{REGEX-PATTERN}` | A normalized value for the regular expression to map back to in prediction. | `ProductPattern1` |
| `regexPattern`| `{REGEX-PATTERN}` | A regular expression. | `^pre` |
| `prebuilts`| `{PREBUILT-COMPONENTS}` | The prebuilt components that can extract common types. For the list of prebuilts you can add, see [Supported prebuilt entity components](../prebuilt-component-reference.md). | `Quantity.Number` |
| `requiredComponents` | `{REQUIRED-COMPONENTS}` |  A setting that specifies a requirement that a specific component must be present to return the entity. To learn more, see [Entity components](./entity-components.md#required-components). The possible values are `learned`, `regex`, `list`, or `prebuilts`.   |`"learned", "prebuilt"`|

## Utterance file format

Conversational language understanding offers the option to upload your utterances directly to the project rather than typing them in one by one. You can find this option on the [data labeling](../how-to/tag-utterances.md) page for your project.

```json
[
    {
        "text": "{Utterance-Text}",
        "language": "{LANGUAGE-CODE}",
        "dataset": "{DATASET}",
        "intent": "{intent}",
        "entities": [
            {
                "category": "{entity}",
                "offset": 19,
                "length": 10
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "text": "{Utterance-Text}",
        "language": "{LANGUAGE-CODE}",
        "dataset": "{DATASET}",
        "intent": "{intent}",
        "entities": [
            {
                "category": "{entity}",
                "offset": 20,
                "length": 10
            },
            {
                "category": "{entity}",
                "offset": 31,
                "length": 5
            }
        ]
    }
]

```

|Key  |Placeholder  |Value  | Example |
|---------|---------|----------|--|
|`text`|`{Utterance-Text}`|Your utterance text.|Testing|
| `language` | `{LANGUAGE-CODE}` |  A string that specifies the language code for the utterances used in your project.

For more information about supported language codes, see [Language support](../language-support.md). |`en-us`|
| `dataset` | `{DATASET}` |  The test set to which this utterance goes to when it's split before training. To learn more about data splitting, see [Train your conversational language understanding model](../how-to/train-model.md#data-splitting). Possible values for this field are `Train` and `Test`.      |`Train`|
|`intent`|`{intent}`|The assigned intent.| intent1|
|`entity`|`{entity}`|The entity to be extracted.| entity1|
| `category` | ` ` |  The type of entity associated with the span of text specified. | `Entity1`|
| `offset` | ` ` |  The inclusive character position of the start of the text.      |`0`|
| `length` | ` ` |  The length of the bounding box in terms of UTF16 characters. Training only considers the data in this region.      |`500`|
