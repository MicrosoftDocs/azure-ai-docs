When you send a successful deployment request, the full request URL for checking the job's status (including your endpoint, project name, and job ID) is contained in the response's `operation-location` header. 

Use the following **GET** request to get the status of your deployment job. Replace the placeholder values with your own values. 

### Request URL

```rest
{ENDPOINT}/language/authoring/analyze-conversations/projects/{PROJECT-NAME}/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}/jobs/{JOB-ID}?api-version={API-VERSION}
```

|`{PROJECT-NAME}`     | The name for your project. This value is case-sensitive.   | `myProject` |
|`{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}`     | The name for your deployment. This value is case-sensitive.   | `staging` |
|`{JOB-ID}`     | The ID for locating your model's training status.  | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
|`{API-VERSION}`     | The [version](../../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md#api-versions) of the API you are calling. | `2023-04-01` |
