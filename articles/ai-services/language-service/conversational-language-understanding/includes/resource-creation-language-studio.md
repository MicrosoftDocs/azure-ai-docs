### Create a new Language resource from Language Studio

If it's your first time to sign in, you see a window in [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio) that you can use to choose an existing Language resource or create a new one. You can also create a resource by selecting the settings icon in the upper-right corner, selecting **Resources**, and then selecting **Create a new resource**.

Create a Language resource with the following information:

|Instance detail  |Required value  |
|---------|---------|
|Azure subscription| Your Azure subscription.|
|Azure resource group| Your Azure resource group.|
|Azure resource name| Your Language resource name.|
|Location | [Supported regions](../service-limits.md#regional-availability) for your Language resource.        |
|Pricing tier     | [Supported pricing tiers](../service-limits.md#language-resource-limits) for your Language resource.        |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Make sure to enable managed identity when you create a Language resource.
> - Read and confirm the Responsible AI notice.
