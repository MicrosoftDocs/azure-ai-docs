To deploy your model from within the [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/LanguageStudio):

1. Select **Deploying a model** from the left side menu.

1. Select **Add deployment** to start the **Add deployment** wizard.

1. Select **Create a new deployment name** to create a new deployment and assign a trained model from the dropdown below. You can otherwise select **Overwrite an existing deployment name** to effectively replace the model that's used by an existing deployment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Overwriting an existing deployment doesn't require changes to your [Prediction API](https://aka.ms/clu-runtime-api) call but the results you get will be based on the newly assigned model.

1. Select a trained model from the **Model** dropdown. 

1. Select **Deploy** to start the deployment job.

1. After deployment is successful, an expiration date will appear next to it. [Deployment expiration](../../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md#expiration-timeline) is when your deployed model will be unavailable to be used for prediction, which typically happens **twelve** months after a training configuration expires.
