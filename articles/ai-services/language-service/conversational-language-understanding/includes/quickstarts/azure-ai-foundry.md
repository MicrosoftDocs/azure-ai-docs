> * If you already have an Azure AI Language or multi-service resource—whether used on its own or through Language Studio—you can continue to use those existing Language resources within the Azure AI Foundry portal. 
> * For more information, see [How to use Azure AI services in the Azure AI Foundry portal](/azure/ai-services/connect-services-ai-foundry-portal).
> * We highly recommended that you use an Azure AI Foundry resource in the AI Foundry; however, you can also follow these instructions using a Language resource.

## Prerequisites

* **Azure subscription**. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
* **Requisite permissions**. Make sure the person establishing the account and project is assigned as the Azure AI Account Owner role at the subscription level. Alternatively, having either the **Contributor** or **Cognitive Services Contributor** role at the subscription scope also meets this requirement. For more information, *see* [Role based access control (RBAC)](/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control#cognitive-services-contributor).
*  [Azure AI Foundry resource](/azure/ai-services/multi-service-resource). For more information, *see* [Configure an Azure AI Foundry resource](../../../concepts/configure-azure-resources.md). Alternately, you can use an [Azure AI Language resource](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_PIMCommon=true#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics).
* **A Foundry project created in the Azure AI Foundry**. For more information, *see* [Create an AI Foundry project](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects).

## Get started with Azure AI Foundry

To complete this quickstart, you need a Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) fine-tuning task project that includes a [defined schema](../../how-to/build-schema.md) and [labeled utterances](../../how-to/tag-utterances.md). 

You can download our [**sample project file**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/language-service/CLU/EmailAppDemo.json), which comes preconfigured with both a schema and labeled utterances. This project enables the prediction of user intent for commands such as reading emails, deleting emails, and attaching documents to emails.

Let's begin:

1. Navigate to the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/).
1. If you aren't already signed in, the portal prompts you to do so with your Azure credentials.
1. Once signed in, you can create or access your existing projects within Azure AI Foundry.
1. If you're not already at your project for this task, select it.
1. On the left side navigation pane, select **Playgrounds**, navigate to the **Language playground tile**, and then choose the **Try the Language playground** button.

1. Next, add the [sample project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/language-service/CLU/EmailAppDemo.json) that you downloaded earlier to the upload area.

1. Select the  **Create** button. It can take a few minutes for the *creating* operation to complete.

1. Once your fine-tuning task project is created, the **Getting started with fine-tuning** page opens.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/create-project/getting-started-fine-tuning.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the getting started with fine-tuning page in the Azure AI Foundry." lightbox="../../media/create-project/getting-started-fine-tuning.png":::

## Train your model

After project creation, the next steps are [schema construction](../../how-to/build-schema.md) and [utterance labeling](../../how-to/tag-utterances.md). For this quickstart, these steps are preconfigured in the sample project. Therefore, you can go ahead and initiate a training job by selecting **Train model** from the **Getting Started** menu to generate your model.

  :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstarts/getting-started-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the getting started with fine-tuning menu in the Azure AI Foundry.":::

1. Select the **➕Train model button** from the **Train your model** window.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstarts/train-your-model-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the train your model button in the Azure AI Foundry.":::

1. Complete the **Select a mode** form by completing the **Model name** field and selecting a **Training mode**. For this quickstart, select the free **Standard training** mode. For more information, *see* [Training modes](../../how-to/train-model.md#training-modes).

1. Choose a **Training version** from the drop-down menu, then select the **Next** button.

1. Check your selections in the **Review** window, then select the **Create** button

## Deploy your model

Typically, after training a model, you review its evaluation details. For this quickstart, you can just deploy your model and make it available to test in the Language playground, or by calling the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/clu-apis). However, if you wish, you can take a moment to select **Evaluate your model** from the left-side menu and explore the in-depth telemetry for your model. Complete the following steps to deploy your model within Azure AI Foundry:

1. Select **Deploy model** from the left-side menu.
1. Next, select **➕Deploy a trained model** from the **Deploy your model** window.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstarts/deploy-trained-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the deploy your model window in Azure AI Foundry.":::

1. Make sure the **Create a new deployment** button is selected.

1. Complete the **Deploy a trained model** window fields:

   * Create a deployment name. 
   * Select your trained model from the **Assign a model** drop-down menu.
   * Select a subscription from the **Subscription** drop-down menu.
   * Select a region from the **Region** drop-down menu.
   * Select a resource from the **Resource** drop-down menu. The resource must be in the same deployment region.


       :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstarts/deploy-model-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the deploy your model configuration in Azure AI Foundry.":::

1. Finally, select the **Create** button. It may take a few minutes for your model to deploy.

1. After successful deployment, you can view your model's deployment status on the **Deploy your model** page. The expiration date that appears marks the date when your deployed model becomes unavailable for prediction tasks. This date is usually 18 months after a training configuration is deployed.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstarts/deployed-model-succeeded.png" alt-text="Screenshot of your successfully deployed model status page in Azure AI Foundry.":::

1. From the far-left menu, navigate to the Language playground.<br>
   **Playgrounds** → **Language playground (Try the Language playground)**.
1. Select the **Conversational language understanding** card.
1. A **Configuration** window with your deployed model should appear in the main/center window.
1. In the text box, enter an utterance to test. For example, if you used our [sample project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/language-service/CLU/EmailAppDemo.json) application for email-related utterances you could enter ***Check email***.
1. After you enter your test text, select the **Run** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstarts/deployed-model-succeeded.png" alt-text="Screenshot of your successfully deployed model status page in Azure AI Foundry.":::
