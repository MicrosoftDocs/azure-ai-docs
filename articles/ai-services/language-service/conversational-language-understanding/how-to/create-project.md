# Create a CLU fine-tuning task

Use this article to learn how to set up these requirements and create a project.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
* An Azure AI Language resource.

### Create a Language resource

Before you start using conversational language understanding (CLU), you need an Azure AI Language resource.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have an Owner role assigned for the resource group to create a Language resource.

[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from the Azure portal](../includes/resource-creation-azure-portal.md)]

[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from Language Studio](../includes/resource-creation-language-studio.md)]

## Sign in to Language Studio

[!INCLUDE [Sign in to Language studio](../includes/language-studio/sign-in-studio.md)]

## Create a conversation project

After you create a Language resource, create a CLU project.

### [Azure AI Foundry](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

[!INCLUDE [Create project](../includes/language-studio/create-project.md)]

### [REST APIs](#tab/rest-api)

[!INCLUDE [create project](../includes/rest-api/create-project.md)]

## Import a project

### [Azure AI Foundry](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

You can export a CLU project as a JSON file at any time. On the conversation projects page, select a project, and on the top menu, select **Export**.

You can reimport that project as a new project. If you import a project with the exact same name, it replaces the project's data with the newly imported project's data.

If you have an existing Language Understanding (LUIS) application, you can _import_ the LUIS application JSON to CLU directly. It creates a Conversation project with all the pieces that are currently available: intents, machine learning entities, and utterances. For more information, see [Migrate from Language Understanding (LUIS) to conversational language understanding (CLU)](../how-to/migrate-from-luis.md).

To import a project, select the arrow button next to **Create a new project** and select **Import**. Then select the LUIS or CLU JSON file.

### [REST APIs](#tab/rest-api)

You can import a CLU JSON into the service.

[!INCLUDE [Import project](../includes/rest-api/import-project.md)]

### [Azure AI Foundry](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

[!INCLUDE [Language Studio project details](../includes/language-studio/project-details.md)]

### [REST APIs](#tab/rest-api)

[!INCLUDE [REST APIs project details](../includes/rest-api/project-details.md)]

---

## Delete a project

### [Azure AI Foundry](#tab/azure-ai-foundry)

[!INCLUDE [Delete project](../includes/language-studio/delete-project.md)]

### [REST APIs](#tab/rest-api)

When you don't need your project anymore, you can use the APIs to delete your project.

[!INCLUDE [Delete project](../includes/rest-api/delete-project.md)]
