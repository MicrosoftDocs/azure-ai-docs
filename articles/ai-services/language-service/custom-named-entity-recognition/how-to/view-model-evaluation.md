# View the custom NER model's evaluation and details

After your model has finished training, you can view the model performance and see the extracted entities for the documents in the test set. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using the **Automatically split the testing set from training data** option may result in different model evaluation result every time you [train a new model](train-model.md), as the test set is selected randomly from the data. To make sure that the evaulation is calcualted on the same test set every time you train a model, make sure to use the **Use a manual split of training and testing data** option when starting a training job and define your **Test** documents when [labeling data](tag-data.md).

## Prerequisites

Before viewing model evaluation, you need:

* A successfully [created project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure blob storage account.
* Text data that [has been uploaded](design-schema.md#data-preparation) to your storage account.
* [Labeled data](tag-data.md)
* A [successfully trained model](train-model.md)

See the [project development lifecycle](../overview.md#project-development-lifecycle) for more information.
