```

| `{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}`     | The name of your deployment. This value is case-sensitive.  | `staging` |
|`{JOB-ID}`     | The ID for locating your model's training status. This is in the `location` header value you received in the previous step.  | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
|`{API-VERSION}`     | The version of the API you are calling. The value referenced here is for the latest version released. See [Model lifecycle](../../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md#choose-the-model-version-used-on-your-data) to learn more about other available API versions.  | `2022-05-01` |
