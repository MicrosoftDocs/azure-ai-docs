To start creating a custom named entity recognition model, you need to create a project. Creating a project lets you label data, train, evaluate, improve, and deploy your models.

> [!NOTE]
> The project name is case-sensitive for all operations.

Create a **PATCH** request using the following URL, headers, and JSON body to create your project.

### Request URL

Use the following URL to create a project. Replace the following placeholders with your own values. 

```rest
{Endpoint}/language/authoring/analyze-text/projects/{projectName}?api-version={API-VERSION}
```

|Placeholder  |Value  | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`{ENDPOINT}`     | The endpoint for authenticating your API request.   | `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com` |
|`{PROJECT-NAME}`     | The name for your project. This value is case-sensitive.   | `myProject` |
|`{API-VERSION}`     | The version of the API you're calling. The value referenced is for the latest released version. For more information, see [Model lifecycle](../../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md#choose-the-model-version-used-on-your-data) to learn more about other available API versions.  | `2022-05-01` |

Use the following header to authenticate your request. 

|Key|Required|Type|Value|

Use the following JSON in your request. Replace the following placeholders with your own values.

```json

  "projectName": "{PROJECT-NAME}",
  "language": "{LANGUAGE-CODE}",
  "projectKind": "CustomEntityRecognition",
  "description": "Project description",
  "multilingual": "True",
  "storageInputContainerName": "{CONTAINER-NAME}"
}

```

| projectKind | `CustomEntityRecognition` | Your project kind. | `CustomEntityRecognition` |
| multilingual | `true`| A boolean value that enables you to have documents in multiple languages in your dataset and when your model is deployed you can query the model in any supported language (not necessarily included in your training documents).
