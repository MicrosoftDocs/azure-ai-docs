To start creating a custom named entity recognition model, you need to create a project. Creating a project will let you label data, train, evaluate, improve, and deploy your models.

> [!NOTE]
> The project name is case-sensitive for all operations.

Create a **PATCH** request using the following URL, headers, and JSON body to create your project.

### Request URL

Use the following URL to create a project. Replace the placeholder values below with your own values. 

```rest
{Endpoint}/language/authoring/analyze-text/projects/{projectName}?api-version={API-VERSION}
```

|Placeholder  |Value  | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`{ENDPOINT}`     | The endpoint for authenticating your API request.   | `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com` |
|`{PROJECT-NAME}`     | The name for your project. This value is case-sensitive.   | `myProject` |
|`{API-VERSION}`     | The version of the API you are calling. The value referenced here is for the latest version released. See [Model lifecycle](../../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md#choose-the-model-version-used-on-your-data) to learn more about other available API versions.  | `2022-05-01` |


### Headers

Use the following header to authenticate your request.

  "language": "{LANGUAGE-CODE}",
  "projectKind": "CustomEntityRecognition",
  "description": "Project description",
  "multilingual": "True",

}

```

| projectKind | `CustomEntityRecognition` | Your project kind. | `CustomEntityRecognition` |
| multilingual | `true`| A boolean value that enables you to have documents in multiple languages in your dataset and when your model is deployed you can query the model in any supported language (not necessarily included in your training documents.
