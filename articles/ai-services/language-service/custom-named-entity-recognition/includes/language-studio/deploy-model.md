To deploy your model from within the [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/LanguageStudio):

2. Select **Add deployment** to start a new deployment job.

3. Select **Create new deployment** to create a new deployment and assign a trained model from the dropdown below. You can also **Overwrite an existing deployment** by selecting this option and select the trained model you want to assign to it from the dropdown below.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Overwriting an existing deployment doesn't require changes to your [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger) call but the results you get will be based on the newly assigned model.

4. Select **Deploy** to start the deployment job.

5. After deployment is successful, an expiration date will appear next to it. [Deployment expiration](../../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md#expiration-timeline) is when your deployed model will be unavailable to be used for prediction, which typically happens **twelve** months after a training configuration expires.
