2. Open the .zip file, and extract the folder containing the documents. 

2. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the storage account you created, and select it.

3. In your storage account, select **Containers** from the left menu, located below **Data storage**. On the screen that appears, select **+ Container**. Give the container the name **example-data** and leave the default **Public access level**.
