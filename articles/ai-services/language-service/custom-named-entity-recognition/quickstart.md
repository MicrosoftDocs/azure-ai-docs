# Quickstart: Custom named entity recognition

Use this article to get started with creating a custom NER project where you can train custom models for custom entity recognition. A model is artificial intelligence software that's trained to do a certain task. For this system, the models extract named entities and are trained by learning from tagged data.

In this article, we use Language Studio to demonstrate key concepts of custom Named Entity Recognition (NER). As an example weâ€™ll build a custom NER model to extract relevant entities from loan agreements, such as the:
* Date of the agreement
* Borrower's name, address, city and state  
* Lender's name, address, city and state  
* Loan and interest amounts

## Next steps

After you've created entity extraction model, you can:

When you start to create your own custom NER projects, use the how-to articles to learn more about tagging, training and consuming your model in greater detail:

* [Data selection and schema design](how-to/design-schema.md)
* [Tag data](how-to/tag-data.md)
* [Train a model](how-to/train-model.md)
* [Model evaluation](how-to/view-model-evaluation.md)
