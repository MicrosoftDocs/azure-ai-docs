# Quickstart: Custom named entity recognition

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for using custom named entity recognition (NER) with Azure AI Foundry or the REST API. NER lets you detect and categorize entities in unstructured textâ€”like people, places, organizations, and numbers. With custom NER, you can train models to identify entities specific to your business and adapt them as needs evolve.

To get start, [a sample loan agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2175226) is provided as a dataset to build a custom NER model and extract these key entities:

*    Date of the agreement
*    Borrower's name, address, city, and state
*    Lender's name, address, city, and state
*    Loan and interest amounts

After you create your entity extraction model, you can [use the runtime API to extract entities](how-to/call-api.md).

As you create your own custom NER projects, use our how-to articles to learn more about tagging, training, and consuming your model in greater detail:
