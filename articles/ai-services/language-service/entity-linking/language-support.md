# Entity linking language support 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Entity Linking is retiring from Azure Language in Foundry Tools effective **September 1, 2028**. After this date, the Entity Linking feature is no longer supported.   During the support window, we recommend that users migrate existing workloads and direct all new projects to Language [**Named Entity Recognition**](../named-entity-recognition/overview.md) or consider other alternative solutions.


| Language | Language code | Notes |
|:---------|:-------------:|:-----:|
| English  |     `en`      |      |
| Spanish  |     `es`      |      |
