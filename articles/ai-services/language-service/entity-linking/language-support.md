# Entity linking language support 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Entity Linking is retiring from Azure AI Language effective **September 1, 2028**. After this date, the Entity Linking feature is no longer supported.   During the support window, we recommend that users migrate existing workloads and direct all new projects to Azure AI Language [**Named Entity Recognition**](../named-entity-recognition/overview.md) or consider other alternative solutions.

| Spanish  |     `es`      |      |
