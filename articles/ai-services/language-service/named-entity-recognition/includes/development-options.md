To use named entity recognition, you submit raw unstructured text for analysis and handle the API output in your application. Analysis is performed as-is, with no additional customization to the model used on your data. There are two ways to use named entity recognition:


|Development option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft Foundry     | Foundry is a web-based platform that lets you use named entity recognition with text examples with your own data when you sign up. For more information, see the [Foundry website](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) or [Foundry documentation](../../../../ai-foundry/what-is-foundry.md).         |
|REST API or Client library (Azure SDK)      | Integrate named entity recognition into your applications using the REST API, or the client library available in a variety of languages. For more information, see the [named entity recognition quickstart](../quickstart.md).        |
