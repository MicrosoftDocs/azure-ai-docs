## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).



## Create a Language resource from Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from the Azure portal](../resource-creation-azure-portal.md)]




## Get your resource keys and endpoint

1. Go to your resource overview page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
2. From the menu on the left side, select **Keys and Endpoint**. You will use the endpoint and key for the API requests

## Create an orchestration workflow project 

Once you have a Language resource created, create an orchestration workflow project. A project is a work area for building your custom ML models based on your data. Your project can only be accessed by you and others who have access to the Language resource being used.

For this quickstart, complete the [CLU](../../../conversational-language-understanding/quickstart.md) quickstart to create a CLU project to be used in orchestration workflow.

[!INCLUDE [Create project](../rest-api/create-project.md)]



## Build schema

After completing the CLU quickstart, and creating an orchestration project, the next step is to add intents.

[!INCLUDE [Import project](../rest-api/import-project.md)]




## Train your model

To train a model, you need to start a training job. The output of a successful training job is your trained model.

[!INCLUDE [train model](../rest-api/train-model.md)]



### Get Training Status

Training could take sometime between 10 and 30 minutes. You can use the following request to keep polling the status of the training job until it is successfully completed.

[!INCLUDE [get training model status](../rest-api/get-training-status.md)]



## Deploy your model

Generally after training a model you would review its evaluation details. In this quickstart, you will just deploy your model, and call the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/clu-apis) to query the results.

### Submit deployment job

[!INCLUDE [deploy model](../rest-api/deploy-model.md)]



### Get deployment job status

[!INCLUDE [get deployment status](../rest-api/get-deployment-status.md)]



## Query model 

After your model is deployed, you can start using it to make predictions through the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/clu-apis). 

Once deployment succeeds, you can begin querying your deployed model for predictions. 

[!INCLUDE [test model](../rest-api/query-model.md)]



## Clean up resources

When you don't need your project anymore, you can delete your project using the APIs.

[!INCLUDE [Delete project](../rest-api/delete-project.md)]
