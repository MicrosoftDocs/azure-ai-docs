# Custom Text Analytics for health service limits

Use this article to learn about the data and service limits when using custom Text Analytics for health.

## Language resource limits

* Your Language resource has to be created in one of the [supported regions](#regional-availability).

* Your resource must be one of the supported pricing tiers:
    
    |Tier|Description|Limit|
    |--|--|--|
    |S |Paid tier|You can have unlimited Language S tier resources per subscription. | 
    
    
* You can only connect one storage account per resource. This process is irreversible. If you connect a storage account to your resource, you cannot unlink it later. Learn more about [connecting a storage account](../how-to/create-project.md#create-language-resource-and-connect-storage-account)

* You can have up to 500 projects per resource.

* Project names have to be unique within the same resource across all custom features.

## Regional availability 

See [Language service regional availability](../../concepts/regional-support.md#custom-text-analytics-for-health).

## API limits

|Item|Request type| Maximum limit|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Authoring API|POST|10 per minute|
|Authoring API|GET|100 per minute|
|Prediction API|GET/POST|1,000 per minute|
|Document size|--|125,000 characters. You can send up to 20 documents as long as they collectively do not exceed 125,000 characters|

> [!TIP]
> If you need to send larger files than the limit allows, you can break the text into smaller chunks of text before sending them to the API. You use can the [chunk command from CLUtils](https://github.com/microsoft/CognitiveServicesLanguageUtilities/blob/main/CustomTextAnalytics.CLUtils/Solution/CogSLanguageUtilities.ViewLayer.CliCommands/Commands/ChunkCommand/README.md) for this process.

## Quota limits

|Pricing tier |Item |Limit |
| --- | --- | ---|
|S|Training time| Unlimited, free |
|S|Prediction Calls| 5,000 text records for free per language resource|

## Document limits

* You can only use `.txt`. files. If your data is in another format, you can use the [CLUtils parse command](https://github.com/microsoft/CognitiveServicesLanguageUtilities/blob/main/CustomTextAnalytics.CLUtils/Solution/CogSLanguageUtilities.ViewLayer.CliCommands/Commands/ParseCommand/README.md) to open your document and extract the text.

* All files uploaded in your container must contain data. Empty files are not allowed for training.

* All files should be available at the root of your container.

## Data limits

The following limits are observed for authoring.

|Item|Lower Limit| Upper Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Documents count | 10 | 100,000 |
|Document length in characters | 1 | 128,000 characters; approximately 28,000 words or 56 pages. |
|Count of entity types | 1 | 200 |
|Entity length in characters | 1 | 500 |
|Count of trained models per project| 0 | 10 |
|Count of deployments per project| 0 | 10 |

## Naming limits

| Item | Limits |
|--|--|
| Project name |  You can only use letters `(a-z, A-Z)`, and numbers `(0-9)` , symbols  `_ . -`, with no spaces. Maximum allowed length is 50 characters. |
| Model name |  You can only use letters `(a-z, A-Z)`, numbers `(0-9)` and symbols `_ . -`. Maximum allowed length is 50 characters.  |
| Deployment name |  You can only use letters `(a-z, A-Z)`, numbers `(0-9)` and symbols `_ . -`. Maximum allowed length is 50 characters.  |
| Entity name| You can only use letters `(a-z, A-Z)`, numbers `(0-9)` and all symbols except ":", `$ & %  * (  ) + ~ # / ?`. Maximum allowed length is 50 characters. See the supported [data format](../concepts/data-formats.md#entity-naming-rules) for more information on entity names when importing a labels file. |
| Document name | You can only use letters `(a-z, A-Z)`, and numbers `(0-9)` with no spaces. |
