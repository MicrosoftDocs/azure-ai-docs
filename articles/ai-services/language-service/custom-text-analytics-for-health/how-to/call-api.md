# Send queries to your custom Text Analytics for health model

After the deployment is added successfully, you can query the deployment to extract entities from your text based on the model you assigned to the deployment.
You can query the deployment programmatically using the [Prediction API](/rest/api/language/text-analysis-runtime/analyze-text). 

## Test deployed model

You can use Language Studio to submit the custom Text Analytics for health task and visualize the results. 

[!INCLUDE [Test model](../../includes/custom/language-studio/test-model.md)]
