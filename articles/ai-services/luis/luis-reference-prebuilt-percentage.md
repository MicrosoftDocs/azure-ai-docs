# Percentage prebuilt entity for a LUIS app

[!INCLUDE [deprecation notice](./includes/deprecation-notice.md)]

Percentage numbers can appear as fractions, `3 1/2`, or as percentage, `2%`. Because this entity is already trained, you do not need to add example utterances containing percentage to the application intents. Percentage entity is supported in [many cultures](luis-reference-prebuilt-entities.md).

## Types of percentage
Percentage is managed from the [Recognizers-text](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text/blob/master/Patterns/English/English-Numbers.yaml#L114) GitHub repository

## Resolution for prebuilt percentage entity

The following entity objects are returned for the query:

`set a trigger when my stock goes up 2%`

#### [V3 response](#tab/V3)

The following JSON is with the `verbose` parameter set to `false`:

```json
"entities": {
    "percentage": [
        2
    ]
}
```
#### [V3 verbose response](#tab/V3-verbose)
The following JSON is with the `verbose` parameter set to `true`:

```json
"entities": {
    "percentage": [
        2
    ],
    "$instance": {
        "percentage": [
            {
                "type": "builtin.percentage",
                "text": "2%",
                "startIndex": 36,
                "length": 2,
                "modelTypeId": 2,
                "modelType": "Prebuilt Entity Extractor",
                "recognitionSources": [
                    "model"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
#### [V2 response](#tab/V2)

The following example shows the resolution of the **builtin.percentage** entity.

```json
"entities": [
    {
        "entity": "2%",
        "type": "builtin.percentage",
        "startIndex": 36,
        "endIndex": 37,
        "resolution": {
        "value": "2%"
        }
    }
]
```
