### *Chinese support notes

 - In the `zh-CN` culture, LUIS expects the simplified Chinese character set instead of the traditional character set.
 - The names of intents, entities, features, and regular expressions may be in Chinese or Roman characters.
 - See the [prebuilt domains reference](../luis-reference-prebuilt-domains.md) for information on which prebuilt domains are supported in the `zh-CN` culture.
<!--- When writing regular expressions in Chinese, do not insert whitespace between Chinese characters.-->
