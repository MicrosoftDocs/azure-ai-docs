If you don't see an app that was created by you or shared with you, you might need to switch to a different Azure directory.

1. Select the avatar in the top right corner of the screen. Then click **Switch to a different Azure directory**. 
2. In the window that appears, be sure to select the Azure directory that contains the LUIS resource that was shared with you.
