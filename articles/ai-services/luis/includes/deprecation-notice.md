> [!IMPORTANT]
> LUIS will be fully retired on March 31, 2026. LUIS resource creation is not available. Starting October 31, 2025, the LUIS portal will no longer be available. We recommend [migrating your LUIS applications](../../language-service/conversational-language-understanding/how-to/migrate-from-luis.md) to [conversational language understanding](../../language-service/conversational-language-understanding/overview.md) to benefit from continued product support and multilingual capabilities.
