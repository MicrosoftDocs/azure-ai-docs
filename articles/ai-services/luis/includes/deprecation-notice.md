> [!IMPORTANT]
> Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) will be fully retired on March 31, 2026. LUIS resource creation isn't available. Beginning on October 31, 2025, the LUIS portal will no longer be available. We recommend [migrating your LUIS applications](../../language-service/conversational-language-understanding/how-to/migrate-from-luis.md) to [conversational language understanding](../../language-service/conversational-language-understanding/overview.md) to benefit from continued product support and multilingual capabilities.
