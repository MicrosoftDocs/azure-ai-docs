# Add prebuilt models for common usage scenarios

[!INCLUDE [deprecation notice](./includes/deprecation-notice.md)]


LUIS includes a set of prebuilt models for quickly adding common, conversational user scenarios. This is a quick and easy way to add abilities to your conversational client application without having to design the models for those abilities.

## Add a prebuilt domain

1. Sign in to the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai), and select your **Subscription** and **Authoring resource** to see the apps assigned to that authoring resource.
1. Open your app by selecting its name on **My Apps** page.

1. Select **Prebuilt Domains** from the left toolbar.

1. Find the domain you want added to the app then select **Add domain** button.

## Publish to view prebuilt model from prediction endpoint

The easiest way to view the value of a prebuilt model is to query from the published endpoint.

## Entities containing a prebuilt entity token

If you have a machine-learning entity that needs a required feature of a prebuilt entity, add a subentity to the machine-learning entity, then add a _required_ feature of a prebuilt entity.
