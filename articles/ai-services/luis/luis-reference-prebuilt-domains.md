# Prebuilt domain reference for your LUIS app

[!INCLUDE [deprecation notice](./includes/deprecation-notice.md)]


This reference provides information about the [prebuilt domains](./howto-add-prebuilt-models.md), which are prebuilt collections of intents and entities that LUIS offers.

[Custom domains](how-to/sign-in.md), by contrast, start with no intents and models. You can add any prebuilt domain intents and entities to a custom model.

## Prebuilt domains per language

The table below summarizes the currently supported domains. Support for English is usually more complete than others.
