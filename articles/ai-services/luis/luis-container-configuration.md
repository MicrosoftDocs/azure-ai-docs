# Configure Language Understanding Docker containers 

[!INCLUDE [deprecation notice](./includes/deprecation-notice.md)]


The **Language Understanding** (LUIS) container runtime environment is configured using the `docker run` command arguments. LUIS has several required settings, along with a few optional settings. Several [examples](#example-docker-run-commands) of the command are available. The container-specific settings are the input [mount settings](#mount-settings) and the billing settings. 

## Configuration settings

This container has the following configuration settings:

|Required|Setting|Purpose|
|--|--|--|
|Yes|[ApiKey](#apikey-setting)|Used to track billing information.|
|No|[ApplicationInsights](#applicationinsights-setting)|Allows you to add [Azure Application Insights](/azure/application-insights) telemetry support to your container.|
|Yes|[Billing](#billing-setting)|Specifies the endpoint URI of the service resource on Azure.|
|Yes|[Eula](#eula-setting)| Indicates that you've accepted the license for the container.|
|No|[Fluentd](#fluentd-settings)|Write log and, optionally, metric data to a Fluentd server.|
|No|[Http Proxy](#http-proxy-credentials-settings)|Configure an HTTP proxy for making outbound requests.|
|No|[Logging](#logging-settings)|Provides ASP.NET Core logging support for your container. |
|Yes|[Mounts](#mount-settings)|Read and write data from host computer to container and from container back to host computer.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [`ApiKey`](#apikey-setting), [`Billing`](#billing-setting), and [`Eula`](#eula-setting) settings are used together, and you must provide valid values for all three of them; otherwise your container won't start. For more information about using these configuration settings to instantiate a container, see [Billing](luis-container-howto.md#billing).

## ApiKey setting

The `ApiKey` setting specifies the Azure resource key used to track billing information for the container. You must specify a value for the ApiKey and the value must be a valid key for the _Azure AI services_ resource specified for the [`Billing`](#billing-setting) configuration setting.

This setting can be found in the following places:

* Azure portal: **Azure AI services** Resource Management, under **Keys**
* LUIS portal: **Keys and Endpoint settings** page. 

Do not use the starter key or the authoring key. 

## ApplicationInsights setting

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration ApplicationInsights settings](../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-application-insights.md)]

## Billing setting

The `Billing` setting specifies the endpoint URI of the _Azure AI services_ resource on Azure used to meter billing information for the container. You must specify a value for this configuration setting, and the value must be a valid endpoint URI for an _Azure AI services_ resource on Azure. The container reports usage about every 10 to 15 minutes.

This setting can be found in the following places:

* Azure portal: **Azure AI services** Overview, labeled `Endpoint`
* LUIS portal: **Keys and Endpoint settings** page, as part of the endpoint URI.

| Required | Name | Data type | Description |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Yes      | `Billing` | string | Billing endpoint URI. For more information on obtaining the billing URI, see [gather required parameters](luis-container-howto.md#gather-required-parameters). For more information and a complete list of regional endpoints, see [Custom subdomain names for Azure AI services](../cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md). |

## Eula setting

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration eula settings](../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-eula.md)]

## Fluentd settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration fluentd settings](../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-fluentd.md)]

## HTTP proxy credentials settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration fluentd settings](../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-http-proxy.md)]

## Logging settings
 
[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration logging settings](../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-logging.md)]

## Mount settings

Use bind mounts to read and write data to and from the container. You can specify an input mount or output mount by specifying the `--mount` option in the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command. 

The LUIS container doesn't use input or output mounts to store training or service data. 

The exact syntax of the host mount location varies depending on the host operating system. Additionally, the [host computer](luis-container-howto.md#the-host-computer)'s mount location may not be accessible due to a conflict between permissions used by the docker service account and the host mount location permissions. 

The following table describes the settings supported.

|Required| Name | Data type | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
|Yes| `Input` | String | The target of the input mount. The default value is `/input`. This is the location of the LUIS package files. <br><br>Example:<br>`--mount type=bind,src=c:\input,target=/input`|
|No| `Output` | String | The target of the output mount. The default value is `/output`. This is the location of the logs. This includes LUIS query logs and container logs. <br><br>Example:<br>`--mount type=bind,src=c:\output,target=/output`|

## Example docker run commands

The following examples use the configuration settings to illustrate how to write and use `docker run` commands.  Once running, the container continues to run until you [stop](luis-container-howto.md#stop-the-container) it.

* These examples use the directory off the `C:` drive to avoid any permission conflicts on Windows. If you need to use a specific directory as the input directory, you might need to grant the docker service permission. 
* Do not change the order of the arguments unless you are very familiar with docker containers.
* If you are using a different operating system, use the correct console/terminal, folder syntax for mounts, and line continuation character for your system. These examples assume a Windows console with a line continuation character `^`. Because the container is a Linux operating system, the target mount uses a Linux-style folder syntax.

Replace {_argument_name_} with your own values:

| Placeholder | Value | Format or example |
|-------------|-------|---|
| **{API_KEY}** | The endpoint key of the `LUIS` resource on the Azure `LUIS` Keys page. | `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| **{ENDPOINT_URI}** | The billing endpoint value is available on the Azure `LUIS` Overview page.| See [gather required parameters](luis-container-howto.md#gather-required-parameters) for explicit examples. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Eula`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey` options must be specified to run the container; otherwise, the container won't start. For more information, see [Billing](luis-container-howto.md#billing).
> The ApiKey value is the **Key** from the Keys and Endpoints page in the LUIS portal and is also available on the Azure `Azure AI services` resource keys page. 

### Basic example

The following example has the fewest arguments possible to run the container:

```console
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 2 ^
--mount type=bind,src=c:\input,target=/input ^
--mount type=bind,src=c:\output,target=/output ^
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/luis:latest ^
Eula=accept ^
Billing={ENDPOINT_URL} ^
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

### ApplicationInsights example

The following example sets the ApplicationInsights argument to send telemetry to Application Insights while the container is running:

```console
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 6g --cpus 2 ^
--mount type=bind,src=c:\input,target=/input ^
--mount type=bind,src=c:\output,target=/output ^
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/luis:latest ^
Eula=accept ^
Billing={ENDPOINT_URL} ^
ApiKey={API_KEY} ^
InstrumentationKey={INSTRUMENTATION_KEY}
```

### Logging example 

The following command sets the logging level, `Logging:Console:LogLevel`, to configure the logging level to [`Information`](https://msdn.microsoft.com). 

```console
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 6g --cpus 2 ^
--mount type=bind,src=c:\input,target=/input ^
--mount type=bind,src=c:\output,target=/output ^
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/luis:latest ^
Eula=accept ^
Billing={ENDPOINT_URL} ^
ApiKey={API_KEY} ^
Logging:Console:LogLevel:Default=Information
```
