# Quickstart: Language Understanding (LUIS) client libraries and REST API

[!INCLUDE [deprecation notice](./includes/deprecation-notice.md)]

Create and query an Azure LUIS artificial intelligence (AI) app with the LUIS SDK client libraries with this quickstart using C#, Python, or JavaScript. You can also use cURL to send requests using the REST API.

Language Understanding (LUIS) enables you to apply natural language processing (NLP) to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information.

* The **authoring** client library and REST API allows you to create, edit, train, and publish your LUIS app.
* The **prediction runtime** client library and REST API allows you to query the published app.

## Clean up resources

You can delete the app from the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai) and delete the Azure resources from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

If you're using the REST API, delete the `ExampleUtterances.JSON` file from the file system when you're done with the quickstart.

## Troubleshooting

* Authenticating to the client library - authentication errors usually indicate that the wrong key & endpoint were used. This quickstart uses the authoring key and endpoint for the prediction runtime as a convenience, but will only work if you haven't already used the monthly quota. If you can't use the authoring key and endpoint, you need to use the prediction runtime key and endpoint when accessing the prediction runtime SDK client library.
* Creating entities - if you get an error creating the nested machine-learning entity used in this tutorial, make sure you copied the code and didn't alter the code to create a different entity.
* Creating example utterances - if you get an error creating the labeled example utterance used in this tutorial, make sure you copied the code and didn't alter the code to create a different labeled example.
* Training - if you get a training error, this usually indicates an empty app (no intents with example utterances), or an app with intents or entities that are malformed.
* Miscellaneous errors - because the code calls into the client libraries with text and JSON objects, make sure you haven't changed the code.

Other errors - if you get an error not covered in the preceding list, let us know by giving feedback at the bottom on this page. Include the programming language and version of the client libraries you installed.
