> [!NOTE]
> Important Update 9/19/2024: All URLs are changing.  We are enabling public access to all Genomics Data Lake containers.  The existing “signed URLs” (shared access signatures) will be retired at: 2024-11-04T00:00:00Z. After this time, the URLs without a query string will continue to work, however the “signed URLs” will no longer work and will return a 403 HTTP status code.  Please plan accordingly to access the public URLs without a query string after this date (remove the ‘?’ and trailing characters).
