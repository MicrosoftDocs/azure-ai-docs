> Important Update May 2025: 
Dear Community,
Weâ€™d like to inform you of an upcoming change regarding the Genomics open datasets currently available through Azure.
After careful consideration, we decided to shift our focus to new initiatives that will better serve our community and align with our long-term goals. As such, access to the Genomics open datasets on Azure will be deprecated in the coming months.
We understand these datasets were valuable for research, development, and learning, and we deeply appreciate the contributions and engagement from our community over time.
Thank you for your understanding and support.
