# 1000 Genomes

The 1000 Genomes Project ran between 2008 and 2015, to create the largest public catalog of human variation and genotype data. The final data set contains data for 2,504 individuals from 26 populations and 84 million identified variants. For more information, visit the 1000 Genome Project [website](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) and these publications:

## Data source

This dataset is a mirror of [this](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/) FTP resource.

## Data volumes and update frequency

This dataset contains approximately 815 TB of data. It receives daily updates.

## Storage location

This dataset is stored in the West US 2 and West Central US Azure regions. We recommend locating compute resources in West US 2 or West Central US for affinity.

## Data access

West US 2:"https://dataset1000genomes.blob.core.windows.net/dataset'"

West Central US: "https://dataset1000genomes-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/dataset"

## Use Terms

Following the final publications, data from the 1000 Genomes Project is publicly available, without embargo, to anyone for use under the terms provided by the [dataset source](http://www.internationalgenome.org/data). Use of the data should be cited per details available in the 1000 Genome Project [FAQ resource](https://www.internationalgenome.org/faq).
