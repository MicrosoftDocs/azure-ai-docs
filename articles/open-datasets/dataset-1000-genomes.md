# 1000 Genomes

[!INCLUDE [Open Dataset access change notice](./includes/open-datasets-change-note.md)]

The 1000 Genomes Project ran between 2008 and 2015, to create the largest public catalog of human variation and genotype data. The final data set contains data for 2,504 individuals from 26 populations and 84 million identified variants. For more information, visit the 1000 Genome Project [website](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) and these publications:
