# COVID-19 Data Lake

The COVID-19 Data Lake contains COVID-19 related datasets from various sources. It covers testing and patient outcome tracking data, social distancing policy, hospital capacity, mobility, and so on.

[!INCLUDE [Open Dataset usage notice](./includes/open-datasets-usage-note.md)]

The COVID-19 Data Lake is hosted in Azure Data Lake Storage in the East US region. For each dataset, modified versions in csv, json, json-lines, and parquet formats are available. The raw data is also available as ingested.

ISO 3166 subdivision codes are added where not present to simplify joining. Column names reformatted in lower case with underscore separators. Datasets are updated daily with historical copies of modified and raw files also available.
