# Create Azure Machine Learning datasets from Azure Open Datasets

In this article, you learn how to bring curated enrichment data into your local or remote machine learning experiments, with [Azure Machine Learning](../machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md) datasets and [Azure Open Datasets](./index.yml).

With an [Azure Machine Learning dataset](../machine-learning/v1/how-to-create-register-datasets.md), you create a reference to the data source location, along with a copy of its metadata. Because datasets are lazily evaluated, and because the data remains in its existing location, you

- Don't risk unintentionally changes to your original data sources
- Incur no extra storage cost
- Improve ML workflow performance speeds

For more information about where datasets fit in the overall Azure Machine Learning data access workflow, visit the [Securely access data](../machine-learning/v1/concept-data.md#data-workflow) article.

Azure Open Datasets are curated public datasets that add scenario-specific features to enrich your predictive solutions and improve the accuracy of those solutions. Visit the [Open Datasets catalog](./dataset-catalog.md) resource for public-domain data that can help you train machine learning models - for example:

- [Health and genomics](./dataset-catalog.md#health-and-genomics)
- [Labor and economics](./dataset-catalog.md#labor-and-economics)
- [Population and safety](./dataset-catalog.md#population-and-safety)
- [Supplemental and common datasets](./dataset-catalog.md#supplemental-and-common-datasets)
- [Transportation](./dataset-catalog.md#transportation)

Open Datasets are hosted in the cloud on Microsoft Azure. Both [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](#create-datasets-with-the-sdk) and [Azure Machine Learning studio](#create-datasets-with-the-studio) include them.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).

- An [Azure Machine Learning workspace](../machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace.md).

- The [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install) installed, which includes the `azureml-datasets` package.

    - Create an [Azure Machine Learning compute instance](../machine-learning/how-to-create-compute-instance.md) - a fully configured and managed development environment that includes integrated notebooks and the SDK already installed.

    **OR**

    - Work in your own Python environment, and install the SDK yourself with [these instructions](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install).

> [!NOTE]
> Some dataset classes have dependencies on the **azureml-dataprep** package. This package is only compatible with 64-bit Python. For Linux users, these classes are supported only on these Linux distributions:

- Debian (8, 9)
- Fedora (27, 28)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (7, 8)
- Ubuntu (14.04, 16.04, 18.04)

## Create datasets with the SDK

To create Azure Machine Learning datasets via Azure Open Datasets classes, in the Python SDK, make sure you installed the package with `pip install azureml-opendatasets`. In the SDK, the class of each discrete data set represents that class, and certain classes are available as either an Azure Machine Learning [`FileDataset`](../machine-learning/v1/how-to-create-register-datasets.md#filedataset) datatype, an Azure Machine Learning [`TabularDataset`](../machine-learning/v1/how-to-create-register-datasets.md#tabulardataset) datatype, or both. Visit the [reference documentation](/python/api/azureml-opendatasets/azureml.opendatasets) for a full list of `opendatasets` classes.

You can retrieve certain `opendatasets` classes as either `TabularDataset` or `FileDataset` resources. You can then manipulate and/or download the files directly. Other classes can retrieve dataset **only** with use of the `get_tabular_dataset()` or `get_file_dataset()` functions from the `Dataset`class in the Python SDK.

This code shows that the MNIST `opendatasets` class can return either a `TabularDataset` or `FileDataset`:

```python
from azureml.core import Dataset
from azureml.opendatasets import MNIST

# MNIST class can return either TabularDataset or FileDataset
tabular_dataset = MNIST.get_tabular_dataset()
file_dataset = MNIST.get_file_dataset()
```

In this example, the Diabetes `opendatasets` class is only available as a `TabularDataset`. This requires the use of `get_tabular_dataset()`.

```python

from azureml.opendatasets import Diabetes
from azureml.core import Dataset

# Diabetes class can return ONLY TabularDataset and must be called from the static function
diabetes_tabular = Diabetes.get_tabular_dataset()
```

## Register datasets

Register an Azure Machine Learning dataset with your workspace, so you can share the dataset with others and reuse it across experiments in your workspace. When you register an Azure Machine Learning dataset created from Open Datasets, no data is immediately downloaded, but the data becomes accessible later (during training, for example) when requested from a central storage location.

To register your datasets with a workspace, use the [`register()`](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.abstract_dataset.abstractdataset#azureml-data-abstract-dataset-abstractdataset-register) method.

```Python
titanic_ds = titanic_ds.register(workspace=workspace,
                                 name='titanic_ds',
                                 description='titanic training data')
```

## Create datasets with the studio

You can also create Azure Machine Learning datasets from Azure Open Datasets with [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com). This consolidated web interface includes machine learning tools to perform data science scenarios for data science practitioners of all skill levels.

> [!Note]
> Datasets created through Azure Machine Learning studio are automatically registered to the workspace.

1. In your workspace, select the **Data** in the left nav. At the **Data assets** tab, select **Create**, as show in this screenshot:
