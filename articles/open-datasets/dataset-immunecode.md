# ImmuneCODE database

The ImmuneCODEâ„¢ database, which includes hundreds of millions of T-cell Receptor (TCR) sequences from over 1,400 subjects exposed to or infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and over 160,000 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs. 
The database is accessible at no cost. Its data can be analyzed to aid global initiatives aimed at comprehending the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and crafting novel interventions.
