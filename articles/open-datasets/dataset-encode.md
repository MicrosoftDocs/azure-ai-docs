# ENCODE: Encyclopedia of DNA Elements

[!INCLUDE [Open Dataset access change notice](./includes/open-datasets-change-note.md)]

The [Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium](https://www.encodeproject.org/help/project-overview/) is an ongoing international collaboration of research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). ENCODE's goal is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active.

ENCODE investigators employ various assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources, comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA, that is, modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.

## Use Terms

External data users may freely download, analyze, and publish results based on any ENCODE data without restrictions, regardless of type or size, and includes no grace period for ENCODE data producers, either as individual members or as part of the Consortium. Researchers using unpublished ENCODE data are encouraged to contact the data producers to discuss possible publications. The Consortium will continue to publish the results of its own analysis efforts in independent publications.

ENCODE request that researchers who use ENCODE datasets (published or unpublished) in publications and presentations cite the ENCODE Consortium in all of the following ways reported on [https://www.encodeproject.org/help/citing-encode/](https://www.encodeproject.org/help/citing-encode/).
