# Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker

The [Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) dataset](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/) contains systematic information on which governments have taken which measures, and when.

This information can help decision-makers and citizens understand governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. The OxCGRT systematically collects information on several different common policy responses governments have taken, records these policies on a scale to reflect the extent of government action, and aggregates these scores into a suite of policy indices.

## Data access

### Azure Notebooks

# [azure-storage](#tab/azure-storage)

## This notebook documents the URLs and sample code to access the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) dataset

URLs of different file formats hosted on Azure Blob Storage:

CSV: https://pandemicdatalake.blob.core.windows.net/public/curated/covid-19/covid_policy_tracker/latest/covid_policy_tracker.csv 

JSON: https://pandemicdatalake.blob.core.windows.net/public/curated/covid-19/covid_policy_tracker/latest/covid_policy_tracker.json

JSONL: https://pandemicdatalake.blob.core.windows.net/public/curated/covid-19/covid_policy_tracker/latest/covid_policy_tracker.jsonl 

Parquet: https://pandemicdatalake.blob.core.windows.net/public/curated/covid-19/covid_policy_tracker/latest/covid_policy_tracker.parquet

Download the dataset file using the built-in capability download from an http URL in Pandas. Pandas has readers for various file formats:

https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_parquet.html

https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html


Start by loading the dataset file into a pandas dataframe and view some sample rows

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_parquet("https://pandemicdatalake.blob.core.windows.net/public/curated/covid-19/covid_policy_tracker/latest/covid_policy_tracker.parquet")
df.head(10)
```

Lets check the data types of the various fields and verify that the updated column is datetime format

```python
df.dtypes
```

This dataset contains data for the numerous countries/regions. Lets verify what countries/regions we have data for.

We will start by looking at the latest data for each country/region:

```python
df.groupby('countryname').first().filter(['confirmedcases ', 'confirmeddeaths','h5_investment_in_vaccines',
    'c6_stay_at_home_requirements','h4_emergency_investment_in_healthcare','c4_restrictions_on_gatherings', 'load_date'])
```

Next, we will do some aggregations to make sure columns such as `confirmedcases` and `confirmeddeaths` tally with the latest data. You should see that positive and death numbers for latest date in the above table match with the aggregation of `confirmedcases` and `confirmeddeaths`.


```python
df.groupby('countryname').agg({'countryname': 'count','confirmedcases': 'sum','confirmeddeaths': 'sum',
                               'h5_investment_in_vaccines': 'count', 'c6_stay_at_home_requirements':'sum'})
```

Lets do some basic visualizations for a few countries/regions

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df.loc[: , ['countryname', 'confirmedcases', 
'confirmeddeaths']].groupby(['countryname']).max().sort_values(by='confirmedcases', 
                                           ascending=False).reset_index()[:15].style.background_gradient(cmap='rainbow')
```

```python
df_US = df.groupby(df.date).agg({'confirmedcases': 'sum','confirmeddeaths':'sum'}).reset_index()

df_US.plot(kind='line',x='date',y="confirmedcases",grid=True)
df_US.plot(kind='line',x='date',y="confirmeddeaths",grid=True)

```
