## Go Language Limitations

The Speech SDK for Go has specific feature limitations. As of SDK v1.44, **speech translation** and **conversation transcription** are now supported. The following table lists the remaining features that are not supported for Go:

| File | Feature Not Supported | Statement |
|------|----------------------|-----------|
| [how-to-pronunciation-assessment.md](articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-pronunciation-assessment.md) (line 132) | Pronunciation assessment | "Pronunciation assessment is not supported in the Speech SDK for Go." |
| [how-to-pronunciation-assessment.md](articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-pronunciation-assessment.md) (line 142) | Pronunciation assessment | "Pronunciation assessment is not available with the Speech SDK for Go." |

> **Note:** Speech translation (added in SDK v1.43) and conversation transcription (added in SDK v1.44) are now fully supported in the Go SDK.

## All Language and API Limitations

Go is not the only language with documented limitations. The following table lists **all** limitation statements found across the speech-service documentation:

| Language/API | Feature Not Supported | File |

| **REST API** | Keyword recognition | [includes/quickstarts/keyword-recognition/rest.md](articles/ai-services/speech-service/includes/quickstarts/keyword-recognition/rest.md) |

### Summary of Limitations by Language

| Language/API | Limitations |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Go** | Pronunciation assessment |
| **JavaScript** | Keyword recognition, Compressed audio input |
| **Objective-C** | Compressed audio input |
| **Swift** | Compressed audio input |
| **Java** | Windows on ARM64 platform (not supported) |
| **REST API** | Speech translation, Real-time diarization, Keyword recognition |

### Summary of Go SDK Feature Support

| Feature | Supported in Go SDK | SDK Version Added |
|---------|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Speech to text | ✓ | 1.0+ |
| Text to speech | ✓ | 1.17+ |
| **Speech translation** | ✓ | 1.43 |
| **Conversation transcription (diarization)** | ✓ | 1.44 |
| **Pronunciation assessment** | ✗ | N/A |

> **Note:** Speech translation was added in Speech SDK v1.43 (March 2025) and conversation transcription was added in v1.44 (May 2025).

## Key Observations

1. **C# and Python** have the highest coverage across Speech Service documentation (97% and 92% respectively)
2. **TypeScript** has limited coverage, only appearing in newer quickstarts (get-started-speech-to-text, get-started-text-to-speech, diarization, and translation)
3. **Swift** has moderate coverage (37%), primarily in SDK-focused pages
4. Pages using **programming-languages-speech-services** pivot provide the broadest language coverage with 10 options
5. Several newer features like **Voice Live** have narrower language support (C#, Python, Java only)
6. **Go** has 47% coverage but lacks support for speech translation, diarization, and pronunciation assessment
7. **Objective-C** coverage (50%) is typically paired with Swift in iOS-focused documentation
